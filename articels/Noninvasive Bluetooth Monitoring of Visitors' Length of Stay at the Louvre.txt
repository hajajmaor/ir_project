Noninvasive Bluetooth
Monitoring of Visitors’
Length of Stay at the
Louvre
The ubiquity of digital technologies is revolutionizing how researchers
collect data about human behaviors. Here, the authors use anonymized
longitudinal datasets collected from noninvasive Bluetooth sensors to
analyze visitor behavior at the Louvre Museum.

ecent emerging technologies—
along with their subsequent rapid
diffusion into our daily lives—
have caused a structural change
in human behavior analysis. In
particular, the ubiquitous presence of wired
and wireless sensors in contemporary urban
environments is producing

human behavior at high frequencies—sometimes even in
real time.
However, despite the widespread use of such
data collection technology, the analysis of visitor behavior in art museums has not advanced
much over the last few decades. The traditional
pencil-and-paper-based tracking method is
still commonly used to time and track museum
visits,1 partly because many of the technologies
that researchers started using a decade ago for
human behavior data collection 2 don’t work
properly in a museum setting. 3 For example,

behaviors have trouble distinguishing between individuals when the density of visitors
is high,4 and such cameras can’t always track
visitors as they move beyond the area of a particular exhibit.1
To address these issues, we employed a Bluetooth detection technique, 5,6 which has many
advantages over other technologies. First of
all, depending on the specification, Bluetooth
can have a more finely grained detection scale
than passive mobile phone tracking.7 Second,
Bluetooth detection successfully works inside
buildings, where GPS connectivity is often limited. Finally, in contrast to RFID8 or ultra-wideband,9 previous participation isn’t necessary to
equip any devices or tags or to download the
proper application in advance. Because prior
participation or registration isn’t needed, we can
perform data collection for longer than just one
day or a few days, letting us generate large-scale
datasets of human behaviors.
All of these advantages make Bluetooth tracking the most adequate methodology for our
research. It doesn’t replace simulation-based
analysis, which can estimate visitors’ movement in the museum,10 but because simulation
often requires a simplification of human behaviors, Bluetooth tracking can complement
the analysis by generating relevant datasets in

real and large-scale empirical data.

Methodology: Bluetooth
Tracking System
Bluetooth tracking systems for human behavior data collection can also
complement more traditional social
sciences’ qualitative and quantitative
methods. This is particularly useful for
museum visitor studies, which have a
long tradition of employing qualitative
interviews, questionnaires, and ethnographic observations. (See Eilean Hopper-Greenhill’s “Studying Visitors”11
for a review of such studies.)
A Bluetooth tracking system works
as follows: When a Bluetooth-activated mobile device enters the detectable area, a sensor receives the emitted signal from the mobile device until
the signal disappears. Thus, the sensor
registers the time at which the signal
appears—referred to as the “check-in”
time. When the signal disappears, the
sensor records the “check-out” time.
Then, the difference between each mobile device’s check-in and check-out
time can be calculated to define the
length of stay at the node (note that
“node” refers to the detectable area
formed by each sensor). Similarly, by
looking at the first check-in time and
the last check-out time over all nodes,
it’s possible to calculate how long a
visitor stays in the study area.
Such a series of check-in and checkout time data, registered by installed
sensors, makes it possible to construct a human trajectory throughout
the study area, including the travel
time between nodes. In fact, because
Bluetooth detection offers systematic observation through unobtrusive
measures, a considerable amount of
research has employed this methodology for human movement tracking. 5,6
More technical aspects of Bluetooth
detection—including information
about different Bluetooth antennas, the discovery time, and detection interferences—are summarized
elsewhere.4

april–june 2017

For our study, eight Bluetooth sensors were deployed throughout the Denon wing of the Louvre, covering key
places to capture visitors’ behavior.
Figure 1 presents the approximate locations of the sensors (nodes E, D, V, B, S,
G, C, P) and some of the most representative artworks or areas of the museum.
The museum’s administrative policies
(such as those related to artwork protection or areas with restricted access)
and certain technical or spatial restrictions (such as the circulation conditions
inside the galleries) largely determined
the installation locations and sometimes
prevented placement for optimal detection. As a result, some sensors are situated next to the relevant artworks, while
others are located near but not right next
to the artworks (see the detailed spatial
relationship in Figure 1). The detection range of a sensor can be 20 meters
long and 7 meters wide and can be customized for smaller scales if necessary.
Although a sensor’s range can fluctuate
depending on its location, each one covers the targeted areas.
We performed the data collection at
different periods using a different number of sensors over five months, from
April through August 2010. All of this
information was collected without invading visitors’ privacy, because we
applied a secure hash algorithm encryption to each sensor by converting each
device’s media access control ID into a
unique identifier.
After data cleanup and processing, in
which we adjusted the data to remove
any inconsistencies, we selected 80,693
unique devices to be analyzed for this
article. By comparing the number of detected mobile devices and ticket sales,
we found that, on average, 8.2 percent
of visitors had activated Bluetooth on
their mobile phones.

Factors Related to Length
of Stay
Here, we analyze four different factors
related to visitors’ length of stay in the
museum. The first factor deals with visitor routes in relation with the length

of stay in the museum. This analysis is
largely based on our previous research.
The second factor relates to entry times,
which are used to assess the distribution of visitors’ lengths of stay in the
museum, depending on when they entered the museum. The third factor provides visitors’ lengths of stay near each
specific node, which correlates to a certain exhibit area, and the fourth factor
is the relationship between the length of
stay at a specific node and the number
of visitors around the node (density).
The Path Taken
Figure 2a shows that the median
length of stay is very similar across
all amounts of unique visited nodes
(for example, if someone visits nodes
E-V-B-E, the number of unique visited
nodes is 3—E, V, and B). The difference of visitors’ lengths of stay between
all unique visited nodes and the minimum one (visiting just two nodes) is less
than one hour. In addition, the number of unique visited nodes seems to
have a slightly negative slope with the
lengths of stay until four unique nodes
are visited. This means that individuals
who visited three or four unique nodes
tended to rush during their visits, as opposed to individuals who visited one or
two unique nodes.
To compute the correlation, we used
a nonparametric correlation analysis (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient), because the variables don’t
seem to follow a normal distribution.
We also include a series of boxplots to
better explain the relationship between
variables. A very low correlation value
(ρ = 0.073, p < 2.2e-16) suggests that
there is no relationship between these
two variables. That is, the number of
unique nodes visited seems to be almost
independent of the length of stay.
On the other hand, Figure 2b shows
a different relationship between the
lengths of stay and the number of visited nodes. The correlation coefficient
(ρ = 0.186, p-value < 2.2e-16) suggests
a weak association between the two
variables. The total number of visited

of ­v isited nodes and the visited order. 3 In addition, some routes of
exploring the museum appear as frequent paths for both groups, even
though the least frequent might
be expected to be much more diverse in their choices given the extra time available. For example,
E-D-S-B-D-V-C-E is the most frequently used path for both types
of visitors who visited at least four
nodes (see the green arrows in Figure 3). This path consists of entering
from the Denon access gates and exiting from the Richelieu or Sully access
gates and visiting most of the iconic
artworks in the Louvre museum.
Intriguingly, it seems that shortstay visitors tend to choose this path
more frequently than the longer-stay
visitors, indicating that the former
visitors explore all key locations
possible within their limited staying times. They rush to visit the museum’s “must see” artwork pieces,
which are dispersed throughout the
museum, rather than remain in a
limited area. We speculate that both
types’ overlapping trajectories are
causing the uneven distribution of
visitors, resulting in some parts of
museum becoming overcrowded.

april–june 2017

Entry Times
We also examined a distribution of
the average of visitors’ lengths of stay
in the museum classified by the time in
which they visit. The goal was to determine whether visitors’ entry times
affected their lengths of stay at the
museum. We divided the days of the
week into two groups, separated by the
two distinct closing times of the museum. The first group consists of Monday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday,
when the doors close at 6 p.m., and
the second group includes Wednesday
and Friday, when the museum closes at
9:45 p.m.
As Figure 4a shows, when the museum closes at 6 p.m., the lengths of
stay tend to decrease toward the closing
hours of the museum. The earlier a visitor enters the museum, the longer that
visitor tends to stay in the museum. Conversely, the results on Wednesday and
Friday show a different tendency of visitors, as shown in Figure 4b. When the
museum closes at 9:45 p.m., the lengths
of stay at the museum decrease as time
advances. However, the decrease in
lengths of stay is slightly mitigated in the
middle of the day. Just after the opening
of the museum (from 10 to 11 a.m.), the
length of stay is greatest, but in the late

afternoon (from 5 to 6 p.m.), the lengths
of stay increase slightly. So while some
visitors maximize their utility (staying
time) within the limited time the museum is open by visiting earlier, others
try to take advantage of the longer hours
and wait until the evening to visit.
All of these analyses and results indicate that the time visitors enter can
be used to predict visitors’ lengths of
stay in the museum, but their lengths of
stay in the museum don’t correlate with
the number of visited nodes over the
course of their visit. Although the longer lengths of stay are correlated with a
slightly larger number of visited nodes,
the relationship is not significant.
The Length of Stay at Each Node
Our preliminary analysis showed that
nodes E and S had much longer lengths
of stay than the other nodes. The median lengths of stay at nodes E and S
were 16:29 and 19:03 minutes, respectively, while the median length of stay
at the other nodes was 3:14 minutes.
Node E is at the desk for ticket sales,
indicating (unsurprisingly) that visitors
often wait in a long queue to purchase
a ticket. Sensor S is located near the
Winged Victory of Samothrace, which
is one of the most famous and attractive

Conversely, Figure 5b shows the
comparative “visitor survival curve”
(which is frequently used in visitor
studies to analyze lengths of stay),
when half of the visitors leave an
exhibit or room.12 We observe that
the lengths of stay are largely varied
among nodes: 20–30 seconds for node
D, 90–100 seconds for nodes V and C,
0–10 seconds for node P, 130–140 seconds for node B, and 0–10 seconds for

node G. However, most of the nodes
experience lengths of stay within a
few minutes. Again, we can observe
that two kinds of nodes exist, which
we can classify as shorter- and longerstay nodes. Within the prior group,
half of the visitors left nodes G and P
within 10–20 seconds. In the case of
node D, the stays last a little bit longer,
but half of the visitors stayed for just
20–30 seconds.

The Relationship Lengths
of Stay and Density
The perspective on lengths of stay,
however, greatly changes when examining visitors’ duration of stay in
relationship to each node’s degree of
the occupancy. Figure 6 shows the
relationship between each node’s occupancy normalized by the maximum
number of visitors in the area (x-axis)
and the average duration of stay expressed in seconds (y-axis). As we can
see, a clear tendency exists among the
data. The average duration of stay
first goes up with the room occupancy
from point W to point X, and then
stays around the maximum (point Y)

32

PER VA SI V E computing 

on some o
­ ccupancy level interval
(point X to Z). After that, lengths
of stay drop as the occupancy level
starts to exceed a certain threshold
(point Z).
The length of stay for point W is extremely short because it includes visitors who just pass by the area rather
than stay. When the occupancy level
increases from point W to X, the
number of visitors who tend to stay
longer also increases. Point X can be
considered the equilibrium between
an ideal length of stay for visitors
when they are free to stay as long as
they want. This is because visitors are
free to look at the artwork between

points W and X without any obstacles—in particular, the low density of
other visitors. Conversely, from point
X onward, the average length of stay
remains almost flat until point Z, at
which point visitors’ lengths of stay
start to decrease drastically. We speculate that this is because the highdensity of other visitors can affect a
visitor’s comfort, resulting in a desire
to escape the crowd.
The length of stay for point X varies depending on the node. Node B has
the longest length of stay for point X
(353 seconds), with a 0.238 normalized occupancy level among the other
nodes (see Table 1). Conversely, node
P represents the shortest length of stay
for point X (94 seconds), with a 0.214
normalized occupancy level among
the other nodes. Although the occupancy levels of those two nodes are
similar, the former’s length of stay is
almost four times longer than the latter’s. However, the normalized occupancy level for point X for node B is
higher than that of node P (0.238 vs.
0.214, respectively). In addition, these
nodes correspond to the maximum
and minimum lengths of stay for point
X, although the occupancy levels of
both nodes are quite similar: Both are
around 0.50. Furthermore, the length
of stay at node P starts to decrease earlier than that of node B.
Regarding the relationship between
nodes V and B, although point X for
both shows a similar normalized occupancy level (0.235 vs. 0.238, respectively), the maximum length of stay
(point Y) of node V has a much lower
occupancy level than those of nodes P
and B (0.368 for node V). Additionally, node V has the highest density
for point Z (0.781) with the second
longest length of stay (271 seconds),
whereas the longest length of stay is at
node B (293 seconds).
All of these facts indicate that node
B better attracts and holds visitors
than nodes V and P. Node B seems
to inspire visitors to stay longer, even
during a higher occupation density,

while nodes V and P seem to cause
visitors to stay for shorter durations
when experiencing the same density.
Also, the data shows a visitor’s average length of stay and the node’s
occupancy level form a clear pattern.
The crowd density around the node
largely affects a visitor’s length of
stay either positively or negatively,
but the effect can differ depending
on the node.
We speculate that, up to certain
occupancy limits, visitors are actually
attracted by the crowd, although the
attraction also depends on the nature
of the galleries and the type of visitors. However, once the crowd’s size
reaches a certain level, visitors will
try to avoid the node. This indicates
that we can use point Z as a threshold
to distinguish visitors’ level of comfort, which enables us to manage the
environment to avoid exceeding this
density threshold. Also, we might
want to consider some characteristic
points, such as points X and Y, to enable the management of different types
of environments or crowds inside the
galleries.

ur methodology can fill
in the gap in previous
research on visitor behaviors in art museums.
State-of-the-art technology enables
us to record human behaviors in finer
granular scale in space and time than
the conventionally used methodologies. 2 In addition, our methodology
enables us to analyze visitors’ behaviors in a dynamic way that considers
temporal factors, such as the time of
day or seasonal effects. Using conventional methodologies, it’s difficult to
analyze and compare temporal factors because of the small samples collected during short periods of time
or because of the reliance on indirect
variables (such as a museum’s spatial
parameters10). Thus, our methodology
and conventional methodologies are
complementary rather than exclusive.

april–june 2017

Although our proposed methodology generates valuable information for
a more efficient crowd management
tool, some issues remain. First, the sensor can only detect mobile devices that
have their Bluetooth functions turned
on. This indicates that the sample’s
representativeness might have a strong
bias toward certain groups. Second,
the sensor enables us to detect visitors’
presence in the specific area, but such
sensors can’t specify whether visitors
are actually looking at the artwork or
if they are simply in the area. Third,
although the qualitative method using the interviews and questionnaires
can unveil visitors’ psychographic factors, such as their expectations, experiences, and level of satisfaction,11,13
Bluetooth detection techniques cannot disclose the visitors’ motivations
and inner thoughts in any way—this
method merely identifies their presence
and their precise lengths of stay. Finally,
sensors can’t collect sociodemographics (such as origin, age, gender, or profession) or other traditional behavioral
variables.
Our findings can help with the management of visitor flow to reduce congestion at specific areas and around
specific pieces of artwork. They can
also be used to bring attention to less
visited or less “attractive” artworks
or rooms inside the museum by proposing interpretation tools or walking
tours capable of increasing the value
of such neglected spaces. Additionally,
our data suggests that visitor behavior
is based on some patterns, which make
it possible to foresee their future movement in a dynamic way. Also, the data
is useful for designing the spatial arrangement (perhaps improving the layout of exhibits, facilities, interpretation
tools, and advertisements), depending
on visitor activities and use of space.
Finally, our findings indicate that efficient and effective congestion management of the museum can be realized
by limiting the number of visitors that
can enter, determined by the time of
the day or year.
