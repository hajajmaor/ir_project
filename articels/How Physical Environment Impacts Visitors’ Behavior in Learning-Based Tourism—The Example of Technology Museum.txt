Abstract: Visiting a museum is a popular activity in the tourism industry, especially in cultural and
learning-based tourism. To help plan museums effectively, this study investigated the underlying
motivations and constraints and their impact on the perceived physical environment and visitor
satisfaction toward a museum. The results suggest that the physical environment of museums serves
as an axial mediator among motivations, constraints and visitor satisfaction. Six essential factors of
physical environment are affected by motivations and constraints, further affecting visitor satisfaction
in various patterns, in which architectural planning, exhibition, external environment, and entrance
are clearly affected by basic motivations and constraints. Under motivations, family education and
self-development are the most two profound influences on enhancing visitor satisfaction through
the physical environment. Shops and café are worth special attention in meeting motivation of
attractiveness, occasion and social interaction. The results could support the planning and design of
a satisfactory museum.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the role of the modern museum has transformed from the traditional functions of
collection, exhibition and research into an emphasis on leisure, education, aesthetic experiences and
entertainment [1–3]. On the other hand, a museum may have something different to offer from other
leisure and tourism products, through unique features such as outdoor exhibitions or cultural learning
experiences [4]. Economic, cultural and social demands also push museums to deal with the issues of
visitor experience and profitability [3]. To create a pleasant museum experience, museum planners and
managers must pay considerable attention to visitor satisfaction and service quality [5]. The latter has
always been regarded as key to gaining a competitive edge in the service industry [6]. However, it is
impractical to use the conventional generic assessment scale for service quality to evaluate individual
satisfaction and quality of physical environment in a modern museum [7].
As museum managers tackle challenges emerging from limited resources and budget, they have
to develop effective strategies to improve the museum’s performance and visitor satisfaction in order
to compete with other museums and leisure activities [8]. Tourists’ choice of destination is driven by
a variety of factors, such as the potential to learn, the diversity of facilities, the aesthetic experience,
and the quality of environment [9]. Hence, to improve the museum services, it is important to

understand the market responses [1,2,10,11], namely, what affects visitors’ decision to visit or not
and how they evaluate the services delivered by the museum. Visitors’ interest (e.g., motivation and
perception) as well as the information provided by the museum (e.g., collection, exhibition and events)
are key topics in the performance of a museum [12].
With this background, this study set out to meet three objectives: (1) identify the motivations and
constraints that influence the decision to visit a museum; (2) suggest a demand-based list of physical
environment which affect visitor satisfaction; and (3) construct a causal relationship among visitors’
interests, physical environment, and visitor satisfaction as a whole.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Motivations to Visit a Museum
Understanding the motivation behind museum visits is essential for the planning, promotion,
and pricing of the attractions [13]. Motivation has been characterized as a goal- and value-driven
behavior, which can be grounded in biology, or a complex interaction with external stimuli that trigger
various individual activities to accomplish a specific goal [14,15]. Derived from different orientations
of human psychology theory, two distinct types of motivations have been identified to determine
an individual’s cognitive and affective responses, namely intrinsic and extrinsic motivations [16,17].
The former involves one’s internal feelings, such as feeling interested or enjoyable, while the latter
involves external incentives and interactions. Similar to intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, another
taxonomy applied to travel choices is push and pull motivations [18–21]. Push motivations are
driven by personal and internal psychological forces such as emotion and cognition, while pull
motivations are associated with the features of the destination choices [21]. Previous studies indicate
that motivations that drive visitors to museums include education, leisure, friends, work, physical
facilities, and escapism [22–25], within which visitors seek to satisfy not only one objective but a variety
of leisure incentives [26]. To regular visitors, experiencing the entire museum environment is more
appealing than the collections within the museum [27]. Here, motivation is guided by neither internal
nor external forces and is mostly self-oriented. Widely-used scales for quality of service may exclude
some critical factors that also influence one’s choice of destination, such as the reputation of attractions,
perceived entertainment, and the cultural experience [28].
Researchers have not reached a consensus on how to classify the motivations to visit a formal or
informal place [29–31], but they continue in the efforts to understand the reasons behind an individual’s
decision on whether to visit a museum [32].
2.2. Constraints to Visiting a Museum
From the socio-psychological perspective, motivations can be divided into factors of seeking
and avoidance [33]. Hence, it is also essential to pay attention to the negative aspect of human
psychology. Constraints, as opposed to motivations, hinder people’s decision to visit a place, and have
been the subject of another stream of research [34–39] which explores intrapersonal (lack of interest),
interpersonal (lack of company) and structural factors (lack of time, high cost, crowding, dissatisfaction
with or unattractiveness of the destination environment) [40–42]. Among them, intrapersonal and
structural constraints affect visitors’ intention significantly, while interpersonal ones do not [41].
Constraints are not necessarily barriers to leisure participation because people negotiate
them [43–46] using various strategies [47,48]. Self-efficacy [49], social capital and motivation are
factors affecting the negotiation and relative strategies [50].
Constraints that influence people’s decision to visit a museum may comprise psychological
and situational factors, as well as those attributed to the museum itself. Factors such as individual
psychological status, preference, socioeconomic status, and interpersonal relationship are not dictated
or controlled by the museum environment or staff. Other factors, such as promotion, image of
the museum, the quality of service, and physical facilities can be manipulated and controlled

Sustainability 2018, 10, 3880

by the museum, which should have been addressed through planning or management to reduce
constraints during the visitors’ museum experience. Although much research has been dedicated to
the investigation of leisure constraints, few studies concurrently probe the effect of leisure constraints
and motivation factors. To obtain a holistic view of the human decision-making process, researchers
should not eliminate the constraining factors as determinants of human behavior.
2.3. Museum Physical Environment (PhE) and Service Quality
Physical environment (PhE) of a museum have not been widely discussed in marketing
research. Researchers initially defined and identified the distinct features of service quality [51,52],
followed by either verifying the measurement of service quality [52–57] or extending its relationship
with antecedent and subsequent constructs, such as motivation [18,19,21,58,59], value [54,60–62],
and satisfaction [63–67].
In marketing practice, service quality has been affirmed as an influencing factor to customers’
evaluation and intention to maintain a relationship with business vendors [68]. Through the attainment
of customer satisfaction and repeat purchase, companies obtain sustainable advantages over their
competitors [51]. Zeithaml [62] defined perceived quality as “the consumer’s judgment about
a product’s overall excellence or superiority.” Researchers argue service quality is largely dependent
upon the cognitive gap between expected and perceived performance [69]. The measurement of service
quality is thus assessed by the difference between the two and mostly relies on customers’ subjective
and cognitive judgment [70]. Service quality is also evaluated by the level of service fulfillment
between customers’ expectation and perceived service delivery [71].
Due to difficulties in obtaining objective data on the standard of service and making a comparison
between expectation and performance at the same time, most studies apply perceived service quality
as the major determinants of behavioral consequences in their frameworks [72,73]. Referring to
Swan and Combs’s performance-based model [74], people may perceive both technical quality and
functional quality during the delivery of service and consequently form an overall evaluation of
service quality [72]. Besides, using only a performance scale to measure the construct of service quality
yielded better analytical results than a comparative measurement of expectation versus perceived
performance [55]. In studying leisure and tourism, researchers argue it is not precise enough to rely on
only service quality scales [52] to study individual perception of service quality. Instead, it is necessary
to evaluate the overall experience [7,73,75–77]. Acknowledging inconsistent results from different
service quality measures, researchers engaged in leisure and tourism studies are inclined to develop
their own quality constructs based on perception of service features and emotional experiences [75].
Physical environment (PhE) can be a constraint as well as an attraction for visitors. Hence, to
better predict visitors’ decision on whether to visit a museum, the service quality of the museum
in this study is measured by using visitors’ evaluation and perception of the quality of a museum’s
PhE. To probe the service factors of a museum, the construct “physical environment (PhE)” herein is
defined as the service functions embedded in the museum’s facilities, including both internal/external
environment and information/exhibition, which can be perceived and evaluated by visitors.
2.4. Visitor Satisfaction
Cardozo [78] first introduced the concept of customer satisfaction into marketing research and
concluded high customer satisfaction increases people’s purchase intention, possibly extending it to
other similar products or contributing to enhanced reputation through word-of-mouth. Consequently,
marketing researchers have devoted efforts to formulate definitions of customer satisfaction [70,79–81].
Satisfaction may be represented by different models, such as individual psychological
expectation-disconfirmation [82] (CS/D), expectation-desire congruency [83], equity [84], norm [85],
and performance [86]. Satisfaction can be generally divided into feature satisfaction and information
satisfaction [66]. Feature satisfaction refers to the consumer’s subjective judgment based on the
performance of the product features [87]. Information satisfaction, on the other hand, refers to the

Sustainability 2018, 10, 3880

4 of 25

consumer’s subjective judgment of information in choosing a product, which is outside the focus of
this study.
Customer satisfaction can be established through a series of customer evaluations and comparison
between their expectation and perceived performance in their use of a product or service. The service
quality can be perceived differently based on the quality of product features or psychological outcome.
Leisure satisfaction can be measured by how well leisure activities are perceived to fulfill the basic
needs and motives that stimulated the desire to participate in an activity [76]. In the museum context,
satisfaction can be evaluated via a visitor’s experience in and perception of the museum environment
within a certain period, e.g., during the museum visit. Museum visitors perceiving high quality and full
satisfaction with the physical environment are more likely to recommend the museum to their friends
or disseminate favorable comments to others [28]. Based on these notions, customers’ satisfaction in
museum services should be derived from their experience of a museum’s facilities, functional services,
and surroundings. Hence, the study concentrates on visitors’ satisfaction with the performance of
physical environment.
2.5. Links between Motivation, Constraint, Physical Environment, and Visitor Satisfaction
In the research of service marketing, especially in tourism, customer satisfaction is critical
to both business practice and academic interest. Researchers have agreed visitor satisfaction is
affected by his or her motivations [88]. Established motivations include seeking variety from the
daily routine, recreational opportunities, and leisure experiences [88]. Tourists may share similar
patterns of motivation and satisfaction, such as knowledge seeking, social interaction, and escape [89].
Such similarity between motivation and satisfaction may lead to high overall satisfaction [21,90].
Contrary to motivations, visit constraints have not been a major focus of investigation in marketing
and management studies [32]. As a negative influence on the willingness to visit a museum, we
can expect constraints to influence satisfaction negatively. A combination of various determinants of
visitor satisfaction, including motivations and constraints, works together to influence the decision
to visit a destination. Aside from museums, prior research on other destinations has also favored an
approach that combines motivations and constraints because it provides a holistic view of individual
decisions [91]. However, the causal relationship between the role of physical environment, motivations,
constraints and satisfaction have been rarely explored. While past discussions focus on the linear
relationship between service quality and individual satisfaction, the objective of this study was to
delineate multiple factors of motivations, constraints and physical environment that influence one’s
satisfaction after a museum visit.
2.6. The Hypothetical Model
Previous studies reveal individual satisfaction is affected by one’s motivations [21,88,89] and is
mediated by performance-based service quality [65–67,72,75,92]. Researchers have focused on either
verifying the causal relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction or confirming the
link between individual motivations and satisfaction. Little has been done that postulates a causal
relationship between individual motivations, constraints, facility features and satisfaction in a museum
context. In this study, motivations and constraints are hypothesized to influence visitor satisfaction in
their visit as mediated through their perception of the museum physical environment (Figure 1).

4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Sample Profile
In total, 405 questionnaires were distributed at the information desk of the museum. Forty-four
responses were incomplete (e.g., over 1/3 of the questions unanswered or the same answers repeated
in an entire section) and were excluded from the sample data. The final sample contained 361
questionnaires on which data analysis was conducted.
The demographic results of the survey indicate slightly more female visitors than male. Most of
the visitors were between the age of 20 and 44 (72.5%) and have a college degree (61.7%); students
accounted for a large proportion (Table 1).

Both Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (>0.8) and Bartlett Test of Sphericity
(p < 0.05) were used to assess whether the sample data were appropriate for conducting factor analysis.
The results show motivations, constraints, and PhEs satisfy the assumptions in the factor analysis.
Factors were extracted if their eigenvalues (or latent roots) were larger than 1. Rotated items with low
communality (factor loading < 0.40) or cross-loaded items were excluded. Finally, the factor structure
for three constructs were confirmed and labeled (Appendix B, Table 2). Note that factor analysis was
not performed for the construct “satisfaction” because it only has three items.

This study extracted five factors from motivations to visit a museum, in which “self-development”
(Mo1) is the strongest. Among them, “self-development” (Mo1), “occasion and social interaction”
(Mo2), and “family education” (Mo4) are intrinsic, and “leisure and companionship” (Mo3) and
“attractiveness or obligation” (Mo5) are extrinsic. “Leisure and companionship” (Mo3) and “occasion
and social interaction” (Mo2) were established as motivations to visit a museum, which is consistent
with prior research [10,94]. In recent years, the managerial philosophy of museums has undergone
major changes, evolving from a historical role of collection and research into a competition for visitor
attendance [5]. Visitors find it important to have a setting that makes them feel comfortable and at
ease when deciding if a museum is where they want to spend their leisure time [101]. A museum’s
attractiveness (Mo5), such as its architecture and admission cost, was also found to be an effective
motivation for visiting and crucial in meeting visitors’ needs.
This study draws three factors from constraints which hinder people’s willingness to visit the
museum. All of them are structural constraints rather than personal or intrapersonal [35]. This suggests
structural constraints are reasons hindering museum visits. Contrary to motivation, constraints toward
visiting a museum are more extrinsic, while motivation to visit a museum is more intrinsic. What is
noteworthy is “poor images of the museum” (Con1), rather than “unappealing soft content” (Con2),
is the strongest factor hindering museum visits. That indicates the importance of the images in
a museum. Another effective constraint to visiting a museum found in this study was “unattractive
service and cost” (Con3), consisting of both admission charges and psychological efforts [102]. In line
with prior assumptions, visitors weigh costs against the learning and recreational value they receive
from the environment of a museum and the visit in general, and this assessment ultimately affects
their level of satisfaction [103,104].
The study further suggests physical environment (PhE) possesses six main factors which affect
visitors’ satisfaction: “architectural planning” (PhE1), “exhibition and marketing” (PhE2), “external
environment and accessibility” (PhE3), “entrance and ticketing” (PhE4), “site planning” (PhE5),
and “shop and café” (PhE6). It is to be noted that “shop and café” (PhE6) stands for one of the crucial
elements for visiting museum, and therefore it is extracted as an independent factor.
4.3. Structural Model of Proposed Visiting Behavior
After confirming the interrelationship between the observed indicators, a confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the reliability and validity, and the relationship between

the research constructs was redefined before the measurement and structural equation models were
examined [100]. The reliability of the construct, which captures the degree to which a set of measures
indicate the common latent construct, was tested by using the method proposed by Fornell and
Larcker [105]. With CFA, the average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct (i.e., motivations,
constraints, physical environment and satisfaction) was examined. The convergent validity is
acceptable with the motivation value slightly under 0.50 [106], and the composite reliability (CR)
for the four constructs are well within acceptable values for the criterion of reliability (>0.70) [107,108]
(Table 3). The discriminant validity was also tested by comparing the average of variance extracted
(AVE) and squared correlation (χ2 ) among the constructs. The results show no correlation is larger
than the average of variance, which confirms the discriminant validity [105] of the three constructs
is also satisfactory (Table 4). After verifying different validity and reliability criteria, the construct
validity for applying the research instrument in this study is determined acceptable.

The measurement model consists of two exogenous variables (i.e., motivations and constraints)
and two endogenous variables (i.e., physical environment and visitor satisfaction). The proposed
model revealed an acceptable data fit (χ2 = 267.434, df = 113, χ2 /df = 2.367, CFI = 0.940, IFI = 0.940,
NFI = 0.901, GFI = 0.910, RMSEA = 0.066), indicating the proposed model adequately explains the
empirical relationship between the study variables. Though χ2 is significant, which is sensitive to the
sample size, the fit is deemed acceptable as χ2 /df is less than 3 [109], and incremental indices (over
0.90. RMSEA ranging from 0.6 to 0.8) also indicate the model fits the data well [110].
The goodness-of-fit was assessed to evaluate the validity of the structural model [95] The indices
demonstrate a good fit for the structural model (χ2 = 267.54 with 114 degrees of freedom, CMIN/DF
(CN; χ2 /df) = 2.347. GFI = 0.909, AGFI = 0.879, RMR = 0.030, RMSEA = 0.065, NFI = 0.901, IFI = 0.941,
CFI = 0.940, PNFI = 0.75, PNFI = 0.755). The path analysis of the structural model shows the relationship
between visitors’ motivations and constraints was insignificant (r = −0.12 and p = 0.088). This result
is reasonable as the two are counter but independent effects in determining visitors’ experience and
response. The causal link between determinants and physical environment is moderately strong and
significant. The path coefficients from motivations and constraints to perceived quality of physical
environment (PhEs) are 0.41 (t = 5.54, p < 0.000) and −0.21, respectively (t = −3.38, p < 0.000) (Figure 3).
Therefore, the motivation effect is shown to overpower the constraint effect in determining the
perception of physical environment after a visit. Furthermore, the path coefficient between PhEs
and visitor satisfaction is 0.51 (t = 6.79, p < 0.000). Motivations also appear to have a direct effect on
satisfaction with an impact of 0.16 (t = 2.39, p = 0.017), and an indirect effect of 0.21 through physical
environment (Table 5). The two determinants, motivations and constraints, explain 23.1% variance in
quality of physical environment and the three constructs explain 35.3% variance in visitor satisfaction.

people to visit a museum [22,30]. In this study, self-development is related to four of the six factors of
PhE in a museum, including “exhibition and marketing” (PhE2)”, “architectural planning” (PhE1),
“External environment and accessibility” (PhE3), and “entrance and ticketing” (PhE4), at different
strengths. “Family education” (Mo4) performed as the most profound motivation rather than
self-development in relationship with the physical environment of a science museum. In the six
factors of physical environment, family education affects five planning factors, even more than

Sustainability 2018, 10, 3880

self-development does. Consequently, museum planners or managers should pay extra attention to
family education functions in planning or running a modern museum. Visitors motivated by family
education were also found to cherish the educational and leisure value offered by the whole site of the
museum, i.e., both interiors of the museum building and its outdoor areas.
In contrast with motivations, constraints hinder people from visiting a museum and should be
cautiously avoided. The results show “Unappealing Soft Content” (Con2), which is connected with
three of the physical environment factors, PhE1, PhE2, and PhE4, is the most influential constraint
among the three towards perception of the physical environment. This is consistent with the previous
study, which suggested that the quality of exhibition is vital to the decision of visiting a museum or
not [101]. “Poor Museum Image” (Con1) is found to be a major constraint that keeps people from
visiting, and its impact is concentrated in the external environment, i.e., PhE3 and PhE5. External
environment is found to be especially sensitive to “poor image of the museum” (Con1). Planners and
managers should make more efforts on the external environment when they intend to improve the
museum image.
The study results yield some interesting patterns. The “architectural planning” (PhE1), “exhibition
and marketing” (PhE2), and entrance and ticketing (PhE4) of a museum share the same determinants,
namely “self-development” (Mo1), “unappealing soft content” (Con2), and “family education” (Mo4).
The findings indicate self-development (Mo1), family education (Mo4), and soft content (Con2) are the
basic determinants of museum physical environment. This pattern of visitor behavior is consistent
with the main goal of a modern museum, which is to provide new knowledge, family education
and an enjoyable experience to visitors. Other factors of physical environment show, in contrast,
a heterogeneous pattern in their determinants. Site planning (PhE5) of a museum is affected by “family
education” (Mo4) and hindered by “poor museum image” (Con1). In addition, the museum shop and
café (PhE6), as ancillary services, reveals a distinct pattern compared to other physical environments.
Visitors’ drive from “attractiveness or obligation” (Mo5), “occasion and social interaction” (Mo2),
and halt from “unattractive service and cost” (Con3) are critical to the evaluation of shops and café.
Although “leisure and companionship” (Mo3) is one of the main motivations to visit the museum, it
affects none of the planning features of the museum. This motivational demand can be satisfied when
others are also satisfied.
5. Implications and Limitation
5.1. Practical Implications
Compared to other tourist attractions, visitors to a museum are seeking a dynamic and unique
experience. They come with different experiences and expectations, such as seeking new information
or acquiring enjoyable, aesthetic and recreational experiences. Some motivation, such as family
education, being with others, and cost, are listed as benefits of visiting a museum versus other tourist
destinations [101]. The findings of this study show family education (Mo4) and self-development (Mo1)
influence visitors’ perception towards physical environment of museum most profoundly. Hence,
museum planners and managers should incorporate suitable physical environment and corresponding
activities to serve the two motivations.
The findings about constraints also identify certain factors that may improve museum services
when avoided. “Unappealing soft content” (Con2) and “poor images of the museum” (Con1) are
shown to be constraints to visitors. In addition, “unattractive service and cost” (Con3), including
monetary as well as psychological and physical, were perceived as constraints which could impede
a visit. Hence, it is suggested that characteristics contrary to the constraints should be introduced
to bring intriguing, novel, exciting and enjoyable experiences to visitors to repair the hindrance.
A museum should increase the opportunities for visitors to physically interact through its exhibition
content and format (e.g., using hands-on workshops or interactive technology). A well-designed
physical environment both inside and around the museum buildings may reduce visitor dissatisfaction.

Sustainability 2018, 10, 3880

Enhancing the museum’s general services and providing a flexible admission rate, such as discount
for special events or rates varying according to age, visit timing, and frequency, could prove effective
in encouraging attendance.
This study identifies six factors of physical environment that impact visitor satisfaction and
deserve extra attention from museum managers and planners: Architectural Planning, Exhibition
and Marketing, External Environment and Accessibility, Entrance and Ticketing, Site Planning,
and Shop and Café. This examination of motivation and constraint as determinants of physical
environment reveals distinct patterns, which equip planners and managers with tools to more precisely
define the physical environment of a museum. The inherent planning issues of a museum, such as
“architectural planning” (PhE1), “exhibition and marketing” (PhE2), as well as “entrance and ticketing”
(PhE4) are related to motivations “self-development” (Mo1), “family education” (Mo4) and constraint
“unappealing soft content” (Con2). While organizing these three factors of physical environment,
planners and managers should pay extra attention to the functions of self-development (Mo1) and
family education (Mo4) while specifically avoiding weak exhibition content (Con2).
Besides the interiors, the external environment of the museum is also found to have a significant
impact on visitor satisfaction. Traditionally, planners and managers pay the most attention to the
collection and visual elements of exhibitions and seldom note functions facilitating recreation and
social interaction may also attract visitors. According to the study, the external environment of
a museum should be designed specifically for family education (Mo4) and self-development (Mo1)
while also emphasizing leisure functions. Enhanced external display areas in a natural environment
can add to the museum experience. Facilitating walking and relaxing on the museum site and adding
family-related facilities (e.g., family toilets and nursing room) will also be appreciated.
Additional services offered by a museum, such as catering, souvenir shops, barrier-free facilities,
and special staff attention to seniors, as well as a comfortable environment all help create a warm
and enjoyable experience for visitors. The study shows shop and café (PhE6), which have long been
neglected, have a decisive influence on visitor satisfaction as well as meeting visitors’ motivations
including attractiveness and social interaction.
Research on tourism has confirmed visitor satisfaction and loyalty are two critical components of
competitive sustainability in the tourism market [21]. Prior studies also confirm visitor satisfaction is
vital to building customer loyalty in the service industry [1,3,10,11]. Those who visit the same museum
over and over again are inclined to have high intention to revisit and are more likely to spread positive
words to others. The study found the physical environment of a museum has an effective influence
on visitor satisfaction. The results inform the museum planning or management as to which physical
environment helps enhance visitor satisfaction.
5.2. Limitations
This study was conducted on a group of visitors to the National Science and Technology Museum,
which is located in southern Taiwan. The results might be different compared to studies conducted
across different locations and different types of museums (e.g., art museums). The proposed framework
herein may be applied in future research to test different contexts.
The data collected were cross-sectional and non-experimental. Although SEM analysis provides
a robust method for validating the causal relationships, the results should be reported with caution.
Longitudinal observation and comparison were not possible due to the constraint of time and location.
Future research will benefit from the collection of longitudinal and experimental data to measure the
interrelationships between the research variables and provide more precise results in validation.
Though physical environment is verified as a mediator in this study, it explains already 35.3%
variance of visitor satisfaction. Other factors also considered important for satisfaction, such as
perceived value, corporate image, and quality of learning, were not included in the study. Future
research may include and verify more constructs and extend or refine the relationships tested in
this research.

6. Conclusions
In tourism research, researchers have treated motivations and constraints as critical components of
satisfaction. However, few studies incorporate constraints as inhibitors of perceived quality of physical
environment and satisfaction in making a destination choice. Besides, no conceptual model has been
established that explicitly examines the relationship among individuals’ motivations, constraints,
perceived quality and satisfaction toward the physical environment. This study conceptualizes the
four as a whole.
Five factors are identified in motivations toward visiting a museum: “self-development”, “occasion
and social interaction”, “leisure and companionship”, “family education”, and “attractiveness or
obligation”, in which “self-development” (Mo1) is the strongest motive to visit a museum. Three
constraints tend to hinder visiting: “poor images of the museum”, “unappealing soft content”,
and “unattractive services and cost”, in which “poor images of the museum” (Con1) is found to
be a major constraint that keeps people from visiting. Six essential factors in physical environment are
found to influence visitor satisfaction: “Architectural Planning”, “Exhibition and Marketing”, “External
Environment and Accessibility”, “Entrance and Ticketing”, “Site Planning”, and “Shop and Café”.
The structural model of the study suggests that physical environment serves an axial function
among motivations, constraints and satisfaction. Physical environment has a strong effect (0.51) on
the satisfaction of museum visitors, and, through the mediating effect, physical environment further
transfers the influences of motivations and constraints on satisfaction. Although motivations have
a direct effect on satisfaction, its indirect effect (0.21) is stronger than the direct one (0.16). That is to
say, physical environment mediates prevailingly between motivations and satisfaction. The impact of
motivations on visitor satisfaction (total 0.37) is much more than that of constraints (−0.11). The whole
model can explain 35.3% of the satisfaction of museum visitors.
In motivations, self-development (Mo1) is the strongest motive for people to visit a museum,
but it does not act as the most profound factor to affect physical environment of museum. Notably,
family education (Mo4) does, followed by self-development. For constraints, poor museum image
(Con1), which is the strongest constraint against visiting a museum, largely influences the external
environment. When combining the impacts of motivation and constraints in planning a museum,
planners and managers should pay attention to providing the functions under self-development (Mo1),
family education (Mo4), and contain better soft content (Con2), through which the basic demands
of museum visitors can be satisfied. Leisure and companionship (Mo3) has no significant effect on
the physical environment of a museum. Shop and Café (PhE6) as ancillary facilities are shown to be
important to attract visitors, especially those who come for attractiveness (Mo5) and social interaction
(Mo2). The study carries practical implications on museum planning or management and helps define
physical environment toward achieving better visitor satisfaction.
