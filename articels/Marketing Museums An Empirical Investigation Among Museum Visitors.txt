Marketing Museums:
An Empirical Investigation
Among Museum Visitors
Ugur Yucelt

ABSTRACT. This study of museum visitors was conducted in 24
Historical and Museum sites in Pennsylvania. The study was designed
to discover service quality, and the needs, wants, interest and satisfaction level of all visitors so that the 24 museum sites around the state of
Pennsylvania can serve the public at a higher level.
A self-administrated questionnaire was used to gather information.
A reasonable number of visitors were selected using systematic and
random selection procedures. According to this sampling method, every visitor would have a chance to be in the sample for perfect representation of visitor population. A total of 2,025 visitors were included in
the sample, and 1,932 of them successfully completed the interviews.
Findings indicated that museum visitors of Pennsylvania were highly satisfied with collections and exhibits, labels, educational and entertainment values of exhibits, audio-visual facilities, admission prices,
parking, seating and restroom facilities, and directional signs. Ratings
were very high for courtesy, friendliness, interpretive skills, availability, and ability to answer questions of staff and tour guides.
In summary, the underlying dimensions of museum studies suggest
that the museum experiences of visitors are great assets for policy analysis and managerial implications. Therefore, visitor’s satisfaction must be
periodically checked and marketing plans of museums should be revised
according to the needs and wants of museum visitors. [Article copies

INTRODUCTION
The museums are institutions where objects related to the arts,
sciences and human history are collected, adequately recorded, displayed, stored, conserved and are made available for research, instruction and the interest and education of people of all ages. They offer an
informal environment for learning and fulfilling educational needs of
visitors (Yorke and Jones, 1987). However, museums should spend
time, money and effort for identifying the needs and wants of their
visitors. In this endeavor, visitor surveys may be useful tools and
occasionally used to gather information about the quality of arts and
objects presented in the museums, and adequate services offered to
museum visitors and their satisfaction (Chambers, 1984). The first
survey of this kind was conducted in 1920s by behavioral scientists
interested in assessing the power of various displays and exhibits both
to attract and hold the visitor’s attention. However, surveys in recent
years took the form of interviews, head counting and the direct observation of the reactions of museum visitors (Yorke and Jones, 1987).
Among those, a six year survey (1976-1981) of British Natural History Museums, Public Participation in the Arts survey conducted by the
U.S. Bureau of the Census with design assistance from the University
of Maryland Survey Research Center, and Children’s Museum of Indianapolis are discussed in the literature (Alt, 1980; Griggs and Alt,
1982; Hendon, 1990; Umiker-Sebeom, 1992).
As non-profit institutions, museum officials must understand marketing concept for efficient implementation of their goals and objectives. However, there is an expressed fear that actively promoting
public museum services will only result in stimulating excessive demand which could not be met from existing resources or from future
development as there are no funds available to finance them. The fear
continues that such excessive demand, if unsatisfied, would result in a
large dissatisfied audience, other than a satisfied segment of the market as it exists currently (Yorke and Jones, 1987). For this reason,
museums should emphasize and improve the quality of museum products and services, attitudes and knowledge of museum personnel,

promotion tactics and location decision, and admission fee. Therefore,
many museums are now hiring marketing person on staff, and marketing is no longer an unacceptable phenomenon for them. The Philadelphia Museum of Art has established a five-year marketing plan aimed
at increasing attendance and changing museum’s image for competitive advantage. The Indianapolis Museum of Art strongly defends
marketing in all its aspects to communicate effectively with publics,
and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is using market surveys, broadcast advertisements and prints media to improve its image in the
public’s mind. The Smithsonian Institution and New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art mount broadly based marketing efforts such as
Newspaper advertisements, public service announcements, subway
posters, museum reproduction merchandise and gift shops (Rosenthal,
1982; Andreasen, 1982; Rosenfield, 1993).
Observations and interviews of museum visitors provided clues to
the reactions of more expert and novice visitors. Values held by museum workers are based more on personal feelings about how and
what a visitor may need to learn. Across sites, staff responsibilities for
public education are questioning the lack of involvement of the public
educator during the production of environments to be experienced by
casual visitors (Soren, 1990). Accordingly, several research findings
indicated that people visit museums in their leisure time, for a social
occasion and to be with family and friends. They expect to learn
something important and unique. An entertainment and social aspect
of the visit is as important, if it is not more important. The average
visit usually lasts less than 2.5 hours, and only half or less of time is
devoted to the exhibits. Most exhibits are visited somewhat casually,
and fatigue becomes apparent after about 30 minutes. Therefore, it
will be important to plan the visit in advance which will aim at providing an environment in which informal learning can take place (Miles
and Taut, 1991). Among the majority of visitors there are greater art
demands, musical, and gallery showings. Non-visitors had similar
preferences but smaller number demand the need for more arts. Museum visitors are far more active in their art participation in attending
arts performances. They have more schooling and show apparent pattern of parent influence on their art activities. Museum research demonstrated that if more people visit museums, they should be able to
appreciate the art, and if the arts become more important, they should
be more accessible (Hendon, 1990). In considering visitors’ behavior

6

patterns in the museums, there is evidence that the likelihood that a
gallery will be visited is a function of the visitor’s apparent intentions,
and the museum’s layout (Alt, 1980). A six-year study concluded that
on most measures the results have remained remarkably constant. In
terms of characteristics of visitors, there has been evidence that a
greater proportion of visitors came to museums in social groups, they
were well educated, upper class, and caucasian (Griggs and Alt, 1982;
Larson, 1994).
In order to increase the number of visitors, some museums have
established dollar nights to reach lower-income groups. The Children
Museum in Boston uses group rates and corporate sponsorship to keep
admission costs down. However, getting people in the museum door is
only half the battle, museums need to keep their-visitors connected to
the institution. Museum shops and catalogs have become central point
to promote the museum’s image and extend the educational process
long after a visitor has gone home (Olcott, 1993; Larson, 1994).
Another study dealing with several art museums concluded that
typical art museum visitors are in upper educational, occupational and
income groups, relatively younger, and active in community and leisure time organizations (Hendon, Costa, and Rosenberg, 1989). In
addition, the study of Bhattacharya, Rao and Glynn (1995) showed
evidence that the levels of member identification of art museums are
positively related to perceived organizational prestige, donating activity, tenure of membership, visiting frequency, and confirmation of
member expectations with the organization’s services.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
This study has been conducted among the visitors of 24 Historical
and Museum sites in Pennsylvania. Although some evidences demonstrated that the museum research had been poorly designed and conducted (Yorke and Jones, 1987), this study was designed to discover
the needs and wants, interests and satisfaction level of all visitors so
that the 24 museum sites around the state of Pennsylvania can serve
them better. In addition, it aimed to determine service quality in Pennsylvania’s Museums and Historical sites, and to be able to reach the
target visitors and communicate with them through various broadcast,
electronic and print media such as radio, television, magazines, newspapers, brochures, pamphlets, and Internet. The findings of the study

will be used for effective policy implications and strategic marketing
decisions in terms of promotions, admission fee, services, exhibits,
display designs, parking, road signs, staff personnel, and tour guides.
METHODOLOGY
A self-administrated questionnaire was used in this study. In deciding sample size, the quota sampling method was used. According to
the total number of paid admissions at each museum site, a reasonable
number of respondents were selected using systematic and random
selection procedure. The objective of this research was to identify the
visitors’ interests, expectations, and satisfaction with each museum
site.
The systematic and random selection method dictated that every
second or third visitor while departing from the museum will be asked
to participate in the survey regardless of their age, income, education
and marital status. Depending upon the total amount of visitors in each
museum site, the total sample size from each museum and historical
site would be arbitrarily estimated. Accordingly, this sampling method
will assure that every museum visitor would have a chance to be in the
sample for perfect representation of visitor population, and personal
feelings and bias opinions of any group of visitors would not be taken
into consideration. In this respect, a total of 2,025 visitors were included in the sample, and 1,932 (95.4%) of them successfully completed the interviews. Table 1 shows the sample size and completed
interviews from each Pennsylvania Historical and museum site.
The questionnaire consisted of 30 close-ended and one open-ended
question, and designed to collect information about visitors’ demographic, social, and behavioral background, and their attitudes toward
quality of exhibits and various services which are provided by the
historical and museum sites of Pennsylvania. The questionnaire also
has five points Likert scale type questions to measure the quality of
satisfaction with collections and exhibits, staff services, audio-visual
programs, and museum facilities at each site. In addition, the questionnaire was pre-tested to identify its weaknesses and strengths.
The interviews were administrated by at least two staff personnel
from each museum and historical site. Chairs were provided for the
respondents for their comfort while they were filling out the question-

naires. At the end of each interview, the interviewer was instructed to
thank each respondent with a small gift.
Data were analyzed using SPSSX software in frequency and Factor
analysis routines. The Factor analysis techniques was selected for this
study because of its power in analyzing large number of variables, and
reducing them in a reasonable number of factors which may determine
the underlying elements of respondents’ behavioral patterns.
FINDINGS
Demographic characteristics of visitors indicated that 48.5% were
female and 46.4% male. Although 5% of them have declined to state

Ugur Yucelt

their gender, male and female respondents were equally divided
among museum visitors. The majority of them (74.8%) were between
26 and 49 years old. The 25 year old and younger group comprised
11.2%, 50 year old and older visitors 14%, indicating a normal distribution of demographic factors of age and gender. Data for occupation, marital status, and education indicated that 43.7% of sampled
visitors were professional/business person, married (69.6%), had attended college or graduated (66.1%). In addition, the majority (56.9%)
of visitors’ annual income was more than $10,000 or less than
$49,000. Responses of the sampled visitors showed strong evidence
that a small proportion were member of the historical society (21.7%),
science society (19.5%) or art group (21.9%). In addition, although
73.3% of the respondents visited the gift shop, only 33% actually
made purchases. The most effective publicity was made with museum
literature (15.1%) and word-of-month (29.5%). The least effective
ones were radio or television, and billboard.
Respondents were also broken down into five distinct groups by
purpose of interest: (1) general interest in history (54.7%); (2) interest
in subject matter (17.7%); (3) participating in special events (.03%);
(4) family outing (16.6%); and (5) bringing friend/relatives (.07%).
Small proportion of visitors (10.9%) did not indicate any particular
interest.
A small percent (11.4%) of museum visitors were local residents,
and large proportion was from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(46.7%) and out of state (41.9%), traveled close to 400 miles (67.1%),
stayed one to three nights (27.9%) or more than a week (10.0%) in
hotels/motels (20.5%) or with family/friends (12.2%). The purpose of
their visit was to see their favorite historical site (42.1%) or pleasure
(23.3%).
Application of Factor analysis technique produced six factors that
have eigenvalues higher than 1.0. The cumulative percent of variation
of all six factors is 30.5%. Table 2 shows eigenvalues of each factor,
and Table 3 factor loadings of each variable.
The first factor may be named as quality of staff personnel and tour
guides. The variables such as friendliness, courtesy, knowledge, ability to interpret and availability of staff personnel and tour guides were
included in this factor. Respondents felt that quality of staff and tour
guides are very important to be a satisfied museum visitor; therefore,

museums should continuously look for experienced tour guides or
train them for delivery of high quality service.
The second factor may be named as museum’s collections and
offerings. The variables included in this factor are collection/exhibits,
interpretive labels and educational value of the visit, entertaining activities, audio-visual programs and printed materials such as brochures
and guidebooks. This factor showed significant evidence that historical museums should continuously improve the quality of their exhibits/collection, printed materials and audio-visual programs. In addition, they should use interpretive labels on their collections and
exhibits, and add educational value to the visit.
The third factor may be called as quality of physical structure and
related amenities offered in museums. The variables included in this
factor are seating, parking and restroom facilities, directional signals
and admission price. This evidence demonstrated that quality of museum’s physical structure also effect visitors’ satisfaction and the museums should always spend top dollars to maintain physical structures
in perfect shape.
The fourth factor may be named as distance to travel. Visitor indicated that distance to each museum and availability of overnight stay
in the area may be among the good reasons of their visit. Therefore,
improvements of infrastructure of surrounding areas of each museum
should be an effective strategic alternative to have higher number of
visitors.
The fifth factor is related to demographic factors such as age and
marital status of visitors. This evidence showed that age of visitors and
their marital status are good indicators for target market decision.
Museum visitors in general are middle-aged people, married and have
good education. Therefore, it would be very effective if museum’s
marketing directors use demographic backgrounds of visitors for target market analysis and advertising strategies.
The last factor is named as number of visits to each museum. Former museum visitors who already enjoyed with their previous visits,
they may be interested in visiting the same museum site or different
ones depending upon their interest. These groups of visitor are mostly
local residents of the area, and they have easy access to the museum of
their interest. It may be easier to reach them for effective marketing
tactics and local advertisement.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
The findings of this study demonstrated that museum visitors of
Pennsylvania were highly satisfied with collections and exhibits, labels, educational and entertainment values of exhibits, audio-visual
facilities, admission prices, parking, seating, restroom facilities, and
directional signs. The visitors’ ratings for museum staffs and tour
guides, on the other hand, were extremely satisfactory. They rated
very highly the courtesy, friendliness, interpretive skills, availability,
and ability to answer questions of staff and tour guides. According to
the distance traveled, there was evidence that the majority of respondents were living within a 200-400 mile radius. The long-distance
travelers have stayed 1-3 nights and on some occasions more than a
week near the museum sites. Although only a small proportion of
visitors have purchased from the gift shops, the most popular items
were publications, craft items, and souvenirs. The influential publicity
was word-of-mouth and museum literature.
Target market analysis indicated that the majority of visitors were
interested in history; therefore, Pennsylvania museums identify the
characteristics of this group and try to attract their attention to more or
all the museum sites. Generally speaking, this group of museum visitors is mostly in their mid-thirties, married, and professional people,
and their interest is equally divided among art museums, theater, and
symphony.
Accordingly, marketing mix strategies suggest that Pennsylvania
museums should put great emphasis on exhibits, collections, parking
facilities, seating, and services of museum staff and tour guides. Since
word-of-mouth is a very efficient strategy for publicity, radio, magazine and newspaper may be effective media to reach prospective museum visitors who are traveling a long distance. Therefore, it would be
especially effective if the Pennsylvania museums were advertised in
magazines and newspapers that may be read by history enthusiasts.
As far as admission fee is concerned, museum visitors expressed
their satisfaction. This is a good indication that the pricing strategy of
Pennsylvania museums is competitive and meets or exceeds the expectations of museum visitors. However, it is a good idea that comparative analyses should be made in regard to admission fee.
In conclusion, the underlying dimensions of museum studies suggest that the museum experiences of visitors are great assets for policy

Ugur Yucelt

analysis and managerial implications; therefore, museum officials use
this information with enthusiasm and great care. Visitors’ satisfaction
must be periodically checked and marketing plans of museums should
be revised according to the needs and wants of museum visitors.
