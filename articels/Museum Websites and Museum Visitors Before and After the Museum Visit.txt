Museum Websites and Museum Visitors:
Before and After the Museum Visit
PAUL F. MARTY
ABSTRACT This article presents results from an exploratory survey (administered to more than
1,200 visitors at nine different online museums) that addressed questions about the role of
museum websites in the lives of museum visitors. The results provide details about the use of
museum websites before and after the museum visit, and indicate that online visitors frequently use
museum websites to complement their visits to physical museums. The article helps museum
researchers and professionals better understand the cyclical relationship that exists between
museums and museum websites, and provides strategies for supporting the changing information
needs of museum visitors before and after museum visits.
KEY WORDS: Museum websites, Museum visitors, Pre- and post-museum visit activities,
Visitor studies

Introduction
A positive, complementary relationship between museums and museum websites is
extremely important for museum professionals and museum visitors. Museum
websites should lure online visitors into the museum’s collections virtually, and
inspire them to visit the museum in person. Visitors to physical museums should feel
similarly inspired to visit the museum’s website, using the website as a bridge to
connect their pre-visit and post-visit activities by learning more about the museum
and its collections. If this is accomplished, the resulting feedback loop should lead to
increased visitation and overall visitor satisfaction.
Cultivating this kind of cyclical relationship can be very difficult, despite its
benefits for museums and their visitors. Designing museum websites that complement physical museums poses challenges for museum professionals, only some of
which are technical (Dyson and Moran 2000; Cunliffe, Kritou, and Tudhope 2001;
Coburn and Baca 2004). Encouraging museum visitors to make museum websites a
part of their everyday lives is also very challenging (Taxén and Frécon 2005). To
explore these problems, a number of researchers have studied the relationships
between museums, museum websites, and museum visitors (Kravchyna and Hastings
2002; Thomas and Carey 2005).
This article builds upon existing research by exploring how museum professionals
can use museum websites to build stronger relationships with museum visitors, before
and after they visit museums. It focuses on how museum professionals can encourage
a cyclical, complementary relationship, where visitors to museum websites are
inspired to visit physical museums, and visitors to physical museums are inspired to

visit museum websites. It stresses the need to explore how visitors can be encouraged
to form lifelong relationships with museums, visiting in person when they can, and
visiting online when they cannot.
The results presented below represent one half of an exploratory survey that was
administered to more than 1,200 visitors at nine different online museums, and
addressed the relationship between museums and museum websites in the lives of
museum visitors (results from the other half of this study will be presented in a
separate article). The survey questions reported in this article asked respondents
about the circumstances in which they visit museum websites before and after visiting
museums, their needs and expectations when visiting museum websites before and
after visiting museums, and the extent to which museum websites influence their
decision to visit a museum. The results of the survey help museum professionals and
researchers better understand the complementary relationship that exists between
museums and museum websites.
Literature Review
The past few decades have witnessed unprecedented changes with respect to the use
of museum information resources*changes that have resulted in new levels of access
and new forms of interactivity for museum professionals and museum visitors
(Besser 1997; Knell 2003). These changes have manifested most clearly in the
relationships between museums, museum websites, and museum visitors (Müller
2002).
Digital Collections and Interactivity
Digital collections and online exhibits offer new ways to draw people into museums
and build stronger relationships between museums and their visitors (Lynch 2002;
Cameron 2003). When the Minneapolis Institute of Arts restored one of their
paintings in 1999, they made it possible for the museum’s visitors to follow the
restoration online in real time (Sayre 2000). This approach was so popular, and the
museum’s visitors were so entranced by the way this website drew them into
the process and helped them learn more about the museum’s behind-the-scenes
activities, that the Minneapolis Institute of Arts repeated the project five years later
with a different painting (http://www.artsmia.org/restoration-online). Similar projects, such as the online restoration of Sue the T. Rex at the Field Museum (http://
www.fieldmuseum.org/sue), testify to the power of integrating behind-the-scenes
activities and online exhibits.
New forms of interactivity provide museum visitors with countless opportunities
for learning and exploration (Hamma 2004). Today’s museum visitors are encouraged to interact with museum collections in ways that were not possible in the past.
Using a variety of interactive tools, online visitors can ‘‘strip away’’ layers of
paintings, examining earlier versions through infrared or X-ray lens, and determine
the exact material composition of any pigment used on a painting (Douma and
Henchman 2000). Online visitors to the National Museum of American History can
manipulate a collection of digital artifacts, looking for connections along temporal,
cultural, and thematic lines by using an innovative interface to group artifacts with

Museum Websites and Museum Visitors

common characteristics (Gillard 2002). A growing number of museums, including the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, allow
visitors to create personal digital collections of their favorite artifacts, adding or
removing artifacts at will, and returning to view their collections whenever they like
(Bowen and Filippini-Fantoni 2004).
Interactive projects such as these tear down old barriers of information access and
have the potential to revolutionize the way museum visitors approach museum
objects. They have removed certain restrictions of space and time that historically
have constrained artifacts and collections to individual museums or galleries. Using
digital surrogates, museum visitors can interact with artifacts from diverse collections, regardless of the physical location of each artifact. Advances in interactivity
have removed barriers between public access and behind-the-scenes activities,
allowing visitors to see what it would be like to curate an exhibit (Adams et al.
2001). They have helped remove the physical barriers that separate ‘‘inside the
museum’’ from ‘‘outside the museum,’’ thereby blurring the boundaries between inhouse and online museum visits (Galani and Chalmers 2002).
Online Visitors and Museum Visits
The changing interactions between museums and their visitors concern many
museum professionals, especially given how little is known about how new forms
of interactivity affect the online/on-site relationship museum visitors have with
museums (Haley Goldman and Wadman 2002). For example, museum professionals
often face a common worry when planning to provide access to digital museum
resources. The concern focuses on whether museums providing online access to their
collections will see a corresponding decrease in physical visits. At some stage in the
planning process, someone usually asks, ‘‘if visitors can access our digital collections
using the Internet, will they still come to the museum in person?’’
The commonsense answer to this question is that, to the best of current knowledge,
online visitors are also physical visitors. Logically, this makes sense, as no one asks:
‘‘If people can look at pictures of beaches online, will they still vacation in Florida?’’
In theory, the ability to access virtual museum resources online should serve as a lure,
encouraging potential museum-goers to visit the physical installation. But is this
true? Haley Goldman and Wadman wrote,
The relationship between virtual museum sites and physical sites has not been
extensively researched. [ . . .] Museum Web site staff that we spoke with felt that
the museum Web site boosted attendance for the physical museum, but they
had no concrete evidence to prove it. While there are no studies disproving the
commonsense approach, one can always have more studies with solid, detailed
data that backs up this theory. (Haley Goldman and Wadman 2002; cf.
McKenzie 1997)
Recently, a number of surveys have provided compelling evidence that online
museums actually drive physical museum attendance instead of discouraging physical
visits. In the majority of studies, planning a museum visit is consistently cited as the
primary reason people visit museum websites (Haley Goldman and Schaller 2004;
cf. Bowen, Bennet, and Johnson 1998; Chadwick and Boverie 1999). Kravchyna and

340

P. F. Marty

Hastings (2002) found that 57 per cent of museum website users visit museum
websites both before and after they visit physical museums. Similarly, Thomas and
Carey (2005) found that 70 per cent of museum visitors specifically looked for online
information prior to a museum visit, and that 57 per cent said that the information
they found online increased their desire to visit the museum in person.
There has also been a tremendous increase in knowledge about online museum
visitors in general (Herman, Johnson, and Ockuly 2004; cf. Sarraf 1999). Research
into the characteristics and behaviors of museum visitors, whether those visitors are
in the museum or online or both, is extremely important for museum professionals
(Booth 1999; Falk and Dierking 2000; Falk 2006). For example, Bowen (1999)
found that museum visitors, while traveling, were more likely to visit physical
museums outside their home town if they had already visited those museums’
websites. Such data can provide an increasingly clear picture of the characteristics of
online visitors and their visits to museum websites, which is capable of helping
all museum professionals improve their relationships with their visitors, online or
in-house.
Despite the accumulated data and evidence, concerns about the relationship
between museums, museum websites, and museum visitors are still being raised.
Why? These concerns are unlikely to arise because museum professionals are
unaware of these studies, or that too few studies have been carried out. These
concerns arise because the unanswered questions about museums, museum websites,
and museum visitors are more complicated than whether online visitors will also visit
physical museums.
The Museum Website in the Life of the Visitor
The question that needs to be explored is: ‘‘What role does the museum website play
in the life of the museum visitor, before and after museum visits?’’ This is difficult to
answer because not enough is known about how people interact with online museum
resources in their daily lives, or how online museum visitors relate to museum
websites before and after museum visits (cf. Marty 2007). While prior studies
(described above) have demonstrated conclusively that a complementary relationship
exists between museums and museum websites, that museums and museum websites
are not mutually exclusive, and that visiting museum websites cannot replace visiting
museums, more studies are needed that explore questions such as: Why do people
visit museum websites? How do museum websites influence the visitor’s decision to
visit museums? What do visitors want from museum websites before and after
museum visits?
Answering these questions becomes more important as more museums offer
extensive digital resources online, and as the number of online museum visitors
increases to as much as ten times the number of physical visitors. If museum
professionals wish to encourage a strong relationship between museums,
museum websites, and museum visitors, it is important to answer these questions.
If museum professionals want their visitors to make museums part of their everyday
lives, when they come to the museum when they can, and visit the museum’s website
when they cannot, it is important to answer these questions. If museum professionals
want their visitors to feel connected to the museum whether they are physically there

Museum Websites and Museum Visitors

341

or not, it is important to answer these questions. There is a critical need, therefore,
for studies that explore the role of museum websites in the lives of museum visitors.
Research Questions and Methods
This study presents results from an exploratory survey designed to address the
following research question: What role do museum websites play in the lives of
museum visitors before and after museum visits?
Answering this question involved addressing a number of related research
questions including: Why do people visit museum websites before or after visiting
museums? What information do museum visitors expect to find on museum
websites? What is the impact of museum websites on museum visitation? How
can museums use museum websites to build stronger relationships with their
visitors?
To answer these research questions, the researcher developed an online survey that
asked respondents about the circumstances in which they visit museum websites
before or after visiting museums, their needs and expectations when visiting museum
websites before or after visiting museums, and the extent to which museum websites
influence their decision to visit a museum.
As discussed below in Limitations, the exploratory survey instrument was
intentionally designed to replicate the feel of a structured interview schedule,
thereby allowing the study to reap the benefits of both survey and interview
methods, while simultaneously minimizing the inherent limitations of online
research. The survey questions listed below were presented to the research
participants in the form of a structured interview that guided each respondent
through a discussion of the relationship between museums and museum websites
in their everyday lives.
Respondents were asked ‘‘In general, before visiting a museum, how likely are you
to visit the museum’s website?’’ This question employed a five-point Likert scale
ranging from Very Unlikely to Very Likely.
Respondents were then asked to indicate how likely they were to visit a museum’s
website before visiting the museum in certain situations. This question employed a
five-point Likert scale ranging from Very Unlikely to Very Likely, and listed the
following specific situations:

Respondents were also asked to indicate how likely they were to use certain kinds of
online museum resources when visiting a museum’s website before visiting the
museum. This question employed a five-point Likert scale ranging from Very
Unlikely to Very Likely, and listed the following online resources:

342

P. F. Marty

Online images of artifacts/collections data;
Online tours of galleries/interactive exhibits;
Online educational activities/learning resources;
Online research materials/archives;
Information about hours of operation/location/directions;
Information about admission fees/pricing;
Information about museum facilities/gift shop/restaurants;
Information about current and future exhibits;
Information about programs/tours/special events;
Information about employment/volunteer opportunities;
Information about donation/membership opportunities.
These same three questions were then repeated to ask the respondents about their use
of museum websites after visiting a museum. The same five-point Likert scales were
used, and the same possible responses offered for each question (with minor edits for
changes in tense).
Respondents were asked to indicate whether their decision to visit a museum had
ever been influenced specifically because of the museum’s website, answering Yes or
No to the following two questions:
Have you ever decided to visit a museum specifically because of its website?
Have you ever decided not to visit a museum specifically because of its website?
Respondents were asked ‘‘How likely are you to use a museum’s website to decide
whether you want to visit that museum?’’ This question employed a five-point Likert
scale ranging from Very Unlikely to Very Likely.
Respondents were asked to indicate how likely their decisions to visit (or not visit)
museums were influenced by certain characteristics of museum websites. This
question also employed a five-point Likert scale ranging from Very Unlikely to
Very Likely, and listed the following specific website characteristics:
Quality of information available;
Quality of images/graphics;
Ability to navigate/browse website;
Ability to search website/collections;
Ease of use/usability/accessibility of website;
Performance/efficiency/reliability of website.
To see how these questions related to the visitors’ general attitudes toward and
experiences with museums and museum websites, respondents were asked several
demographics questions to determine the types of museum visitors who participated
in the study, and to classify the respondents in terms of their levels of interactions
with museums. These questions were:
How frequently do you visit museums?
How frequently do you visit museum websites?
From your perspective, how important is it for a museum to have a museum
website?

To reach as many participants as possible, the researcher used several museum
listservs to call for volunteers to help disseminate the study, and nine different
international museums volunteered to advertise the survey on their websites. These
museums were:
The

Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (http://www.famsf.org/);
Science Museum of Minnesota (http://www.smm.org/);

Victoria and Albert Museum (http://www.vam.ac.uk/);
National Museum of Wildlife Art (http://www.wildlifeart.org/);
Fruitlands Museum (http://www.fruitlands.org/);
Royal Armouries (http://www.royalarmouries.org/);
Art Complex Museum (http://www.artcomplex.org/); and
Tryon Palace (http://www.tryonpalace.org/).

Each of these museums placed a link to the online survey on their home page, using
text similar to the following: ‘‘Interested in the relationship between museums and
museum websites? Click here to tell us what you think.’’ That so many different types
of museums agreed to promote this study was extremely helpful in obtaining a wide
range of responses from online museum visitors, and these museums locations
around the world brought an international aspect to this study unparalleled in prior
research.
The results from the survey were processed using SPSS (originally, Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences), which generated descriptive statistics for each of
the above survey questions. Correlation coefficients (Spearman’s rho) and
Pearson’s chi-squares were also calculated to provide comparative statistics that
are useful in exploring the influence of the type of museum and the type of
museum visitor on the relationship museum visitors have with museums and
museum websites.
Limitations
The use of exploratory survey methods has limitations that directly reflect the
difficulties of conducting research and gathering data about online museum visitors.
Meta-analyses of online survey research show that obtaining a random sample or
acquiring representative data from online surveys is extremely difficult, if not
impossible (Couper 2000; Andrews, Nonnecke, and Preece 2003). On the other hand,
acquiring in-depth qualitative interview data from thousands of research participants
visiting nine different museum websites in different countries around the world is
equally impossible. Therefore, this study took the logical middle ground of using an
exploratory survey, where the survey instrument takes the place of a structured
interview schedule. This allowed the researcher to access a larger number of
participants than would be possible in a purely semi-structured or unstructured
interview study, without falling prey to the problems of representation that plague
attempts at random sampling using online surveys.
Considering the limitations of online research, exploratory survey research is often
the only practical method available when gathering information from online visitors
to museum websites (Haley Goldman and Schaller 2004). In this study, the use of an

344

P. F. Marty

exploratory survey research method restricted respondents to people who were: (a)
already visiting museum websites, and (b) chose to answer a survey about museums
and museum websites. In addition, the placement of the survey link on each
museum’s home page may have introduced an unintentional bias, as it is possible that
visitors to a museum’s home page are more likely to be planning a museum visit than
visitors to other pages on a museum’s website. Also, the survey’s focus on museum
visitation may have biased the results for those online visitors who have no intention
of visiting physical museums. While these restrictions place limitations on the
generalizability of this research to museum visitors overall, the following results shine
a valuable light on the mindset of online museum visitors as a distinct and important
research population.
Results
The online survey was administered from October 2005 to October 2006; there were
1,215 valid responses to the survey (out of 1,464 total responses) during this time
period. For the purposes of this study, survey responses were considered valid if
respondents answered at least one question other than the demographics questions.
Not every respondent provided a response to every question, and therefore specific
numbers of responses are presented for each result below, and the missing responses
were factored out of the comparative analyses performed.
Respondent Characteristics
Each of the 1,215 respondents who completed the online survey was directed to the
study from one of nine different museums. Some 422 (34.7 per cent) respondents
originated from the Australia War Memorial Museum, 353 (29.1 per cent) from the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 282 (23.2 per cent) from the Victoria and
Albert Museum, 51 (4.2 per cent) from the Royal Armouries, 41 (3.4 per cent) from
the Science Museum of Minnesota, 29 (2.4 per cent) from the National Museum of
Wildlife Art, 16 (1.3 per cent) from the Tryon Palace, 12 (1.0 per cent) from the
Fruitlands Museum, and 9 (0.7 per cent) from the Art Complex Museum (n1,215).
The inherent unreliability of web metrics and page view statistics for determining
visitation rates (Sen, Dacin, and Pattichis 2006), combined with the inability to know
whether any given visitor to the website actually saw the link to the survey, makes it
impossible to provide any reliable data about survey response rates beyond this
distribution of respondents.
As part of the survey, the respondents were asked to answer several questions
related to the visitors’ general attitudes toward and experiences with museums and
museum websites. Their answers to these questions provide some indication of the
types of interactions the online museum visitors who responded to this survey have
with museums and museum websites:
When asked ‘‘How frequently do you visit museums?’’*13.5 per cent (163)
responded Rarely, 16.4 per cent (197) Annually, 30.5 per cent (367) Quarterly,
27.8 per cent (335) Monthly, 8.9 per cent (107) Weekly, and 2.9 per cent (35)
Daily (n1,204).

Museum Websites and Museum Visitors

345

When asked ‘‘How frequently do you visit museum websites?’’ *12.3 per cent
(147) responded Rarely, 4.8 per cent (57) Annually, 14.9 per cent (179)
Quarterly, 28.4 per cent (341) Monthly, 30.5 per cent (366) Weekly, and 9.2
per cent (110) Daily (n 1,200).
When asked ‘‘From your perspective, how important is it for a museum to have
a museum website?’’*4.4 per cent (53) responded Very Unimportant, 0.2 per
cent (3) Unimportant, 4.0 per cent (48) Neutral, 22.0 per cent (264) Important,
and 69.4 per cent (834) Very Important (n1,202).
Therefore, the typical online museum visitor completing this online survey visits
museums approximately four times a year, visits museum websites approximately
once a week, and considers it very important for museums to have museum websites.
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked how
likely they were in general to visit a museum’s website before visiting the museum.
According to the survey results, online museum visitors generally visit museum
websites before they visit museums, and the vast majority (81.9 per cent) of the
survey respondents stated that they were either likely or very likely to do so.
Table 2 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked
how likely they were to visit a museum’s website before visiting the museum in certain
situations. According to the survey results, online museum visitors are likely to visit
museum websites prior to a museum visit in almost all of the surveyed circumstances.
Survey respondents were most likely to visit a museum’s website before visiting a
museum, when visiting museums unfamiliar to them (89.0 per cent likely or very
likely to do so), museums where the exhibits change frequently (88.2 per cent likely or
very likely to do so), and museums where there is too much to see in one visit
(83.5 per cent likely or very likely to do so). They were least likely (although still
likely) to visit a museum’s website before visiting a museum when visiting museums
they visit regularly (59.5 per cent likely or very likely to do so).
Survey respondents were more likely to visit a museum’s website before visiting a
museum while traveling or on vacation (81.0 per cent likely or very likely to do so)
than when visiting museums in their hometown (61.7 per cent likely or very likely to
do so). Survey respondents were also slightly more likely to visit a museum’s website
before visiting a museum, when visiting museums with friends or family (80.5 per cent
likely or very likely to do so) than when visiting museums by themselves (77.9 per
cent likely or very likely to do so).

Table 3 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked
how likely they were to use certain online resources when visiting museum websites
before visiting museums. According to the survey results, online museum visitors who
are visiting a museum’s website prior to a museum visit are more likely to use basic
information, such as hours of operation, driving directions, or information about
current exhibits, than they are to use online images of artifacts, online gallery tours,
or online educational activities. Prior to visiting museums, survey respondents were
most likely to use information about hours of operation, location, and directions
(92.7 per cent likely or very likely to do so), information about current and future
exhibits (91.8 per cent likely or very likely to do so), and information about
admission fees and pricing (87.2 per cent likely or very likely to do so). Survey
respondents were also likely to use information about programs, tours, and special
events (79.7 per cent likely or very likely to do so), as well as information about
museum facilities, gift shops, and restaurants (64.2 per cent likely or very likely to do
so). On the other hand, prior to visiting a museum, survey respondents were very
unlikely to use information about employment and volunteer opportunities (only
24.4 per cent likely or very likely to do so), or information about donation and
membership opportunities (only 27.1 per cent likely or very likely to do so).
While online museum visitors are generally likely to use online resources prior to
visiting a museum, survey respondents were less likely to use such resources than they
were to access basic information resources online. Prior to visiting a museum, survey
respondents were relatively likely to use online images of artifacts and collections
data (69.3 per cent likely or very likely to do so), and online tours of galleries and
interactive exhibits (61.0 per cent likely or very likely to do so). On the other hand,
survey respondents were generally less likely to use online research materials and
archives (53.9 per cent likely or very likely to do so), and online educational activities
and learning resources (43.2 per cent likely or very likely to do so) when visiting a
museum’s website prior to visiting the museum.
Table 4 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked
how likely they were in general to visit a museum’s website after visiting the museum.
According to the survey results, the majority of online museum visitors generally visit
museum websites after they visit museums, although they are less likely to visit
museum website after visiting museums than they are to do so before visiting
museums. A total of 69.5 per cent of the survey respondents were either likely or very
likely to visit a museum’s website after visiting the museum.
Table 5 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked
how likely they were to visit a museum’s website after visiting the museum in certain
situations. According to the survey results, online museum visitors are likely to visit
museum websites after a museum visit in almost all of the surveyed circumstances,
although in each case they are less likely to do so than they are before visiting
museums. Survey respondents were most likely to visit a museum’s website after
visiting a museum, when visiting museums where there is too much to see in one visit
(79.6 per cent likely or very likely to do so), and museums where the exhibits change
frequently (79 per cent likely or very likely to do so). They were least likely (and the
only situation where the majority of respondents were not likely to do so) to visit a
museum’s website after visiting museums in their hometown (only 47.8 per cent likely
or very likely to do so).

Survey respondents were more likely to visit a museum’s website after visiting a
museum when visiting museums unfamiliar to them (72.0 per cent likely or very likely
to do so), or when visiting museums while traveling or on vacation (70.6 per cent
likely or very likely to do so), than when visiting museums they visit regularly
(57.9 per cent likely or very likely to do so). Survey respondents were slightly more
likely to visit a museum’s website after visiting a museum when visiting museums by
themselves (59.3 per cent likely or very likely to do so), than when visiting museums
with friends or family (55.0 per cent likely or very likely to do so)*the exact opposite
of the same situations when visiting a website before visiting a museum.
Table 6 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked
how likely they were to use certain online resources when visiting museum websites
after visiting museums. According to the survey results, online museum visitors who
are visiting a museum’s website after visiting a museum are less likely to use basic
information, such as hours of operation and admission fees, and more likely to use
online images of artifacts, collections data, and research materials. After visiting
museums, survey respondents were most likely to use information about current and
future exhibits (79.6 per cent likely or very likely to do so), and information about
programs, tours, and special events (68.5 per cent likely or very likely to do so). On
the other hand, they were very unlikely to use information about hours of operation,
location, and directions (only 32.6 per cent likely or very likely to do so), information
about admission fees and pricing (only 28.9 per cent likely or very likely to do so),
and information about museum facilities, gift shops, and restaurants (only 26.3 per
cent likely or very likely to do so). Survey respondents remained very unlikely to use
information about employment and volunteer opportunities (only 29.4 per cent likely
or very likely to do so), or information about donation and membership
opportunities (only 26.2 per cent likely or very likely to do so).
Online museum visitors are generally more likely to use online resources, such as
collections data or research materials, after visiting a museum than they are to use
the same resources prior to visiting a museum. After visiting a museum, survey
respondents were particularly likely to use online images of artifacts and collections
data (72.4 per cent likely or very likely to do so), as well as online research materials
and archives (67.0 per cent likely or very likely to do so). Survey respondents were
generally less likely (although still likely) to use online tours of galleries and
interactive exhibits (53.8 per cent likely or very likely to do so), and online
educational activities and learning resources (53.8 per cent likely or very likely to
do so), when visiting a museum’s website after visiting the museum.

the museum’s website. According to the survey results, online museum visitors
generally do not decide whether or not to visit museums specifically because of the
museum’s website. On the other hand, online museum visitors are nearly twice as
likely to decide to visit a museum because of its website, than they are to decide not to
visit a museum because of its website. A total of 39.6 per cent of the survey
respondents reported that they had decided to visit a museum specifically because of
its website (with 60.4 per cent responding in the negative), while only 19.7 per cent of
the survey respondents reported that they had decided not to visit a museum
specifically because of its website (with 80.3 per cent responding in the negative).
Table 8 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked
how likely they were to use a museum’s website to decide whether they want to visit a
museum. According to the survey results, the majority of online museum visitors
consider museum websites to be a deciding factor in their decisions to visit museums:
69.9 per cent of the survey respondents were likely or very likely to use a museum’s
website to decide whether they want to visit a museum.
Table 9 shows the summary of responses provided when respondents were asked
how likely certain specific characteristics of museum websites were to influence their
decision to visit or not visit a museum. According to the survey results, online
museum visitors are likely to consider almost all aspects of a museum’s website when
deciding whether to visit a museum. The characteristic of museum websites most
likely to influence the decision to visit a museum was the quality of information
available online, with 77.2 per cent of the survey respondents saying this
characteristic was likely or very likely to do so. The characteristic of museum
websites least likely (although still likely) to influence the decision to visit a museum
was the ability to search the website and collections, with 59.8 per cent of the survey
respondents saying this characteristic was likely or very likely to do so.
Other characteristics of museum websites likely to influence the online museum
visitor’s decision to visit a museum included the quality of images and graphics, with

Comparative Statistics
A number of comparative analyses were run on the above results, including
Spearman’s rho and Pearson’s chi-squares. The large number of questions asked
on this survey meant that thousands of statistical analyses were performed in
preparing this article. Given space considerations, it is impossible to present even a
small fraction of these analyses, therefore this section will highlight only the most
notable results from the comparative statistics.
An examination of the characteristics of the online museum visitors who
completed the survey and the influence of these characteristics on the survey results
shows that the type of interactions survey respondents have with museums and
museum websites have some, but no major effects, on the role museum websites play
in their everyday lives. When comparing survey results with the museum from which
the survey respondents originated, for example, the statistical analysis showed no
significant correlations based on the museum where respondents found the link for
the study (Spearman’s rho B0.05 in almost all cases).
When comparing survey results with the frequency of museum and museum
website visits, the most notable result was the strong correlation (Spearman’s rho
0.48) between the frequency with which respondents visit museums and the
frequency with which respondents visit museum websites. The respondents’
frequency of museum visits did not, however, correlate strongly with other survey
questions; the highest correlations found between frequency of museum visit and the
likelihood of visiting museum websites before visiting a museum in one’s home town
(rho0.19), or a museum they visit regularly (rho0.16). While significant
according to chi-squares tests, the weakness of the correlation ratio suggests that
frequency of museum visits is not a major factor in determining the relationship
museum visitors have with museums and museum websites (excepting perhaps
museums they visit regularly or museums in their home town).
However, the frequency with which survey respondents visit museum websites had
numerous strong and significant relationships with other survey questions. For
example, the frequency with which online visitors visit museum websites was fairly
strongly correlated with the importance survey respondents place on museums having
museum websites (rho0.36), the likelihood they will visit museum websites before
visiting museums (rho0.36), and the likelihood they will visit museum websites
after visiting museums (rho0.36). Similarly, the importance survey respondents
placed on museums having museum websites correlated fairly strongly with the
likelihood that they will visit museum websites both before (rho0.41) and after
(rho0.29) visiting museums.

Discussion
By framing the results of this research in terms of the ‘‘museum website in the life of the
visitor,’’ this article calls attention to the need for museum professionals to think
critically about their websites and the information they provide from the perspective of
museum visitors, before and after museum visits. As discussed above, the research
methodologies necessitated by such an approach place certain limitations on the data
collected, but the purpose of user studies is not necessarily that any one slice of data is
generalizable to the whole, but rather that each slice of data accumulated through
multiple studies over time helps illustrate an overall trend in museum website visitation
patterns. When viewed from that perspective, this study helps to illuminate the mindset
of a small, but important, slice of a growing population of museum visitors.
The following discussion, therefore, is not necessarily meant to apply to all museum
visitors generally, but rather to the subset of online museum visitors exemplified by
the survey respondents in this study. Within these limitations, the results indicate that
online and in-house museum visitors are not separate entities: not only are many
online museum visitors using museum websites to plan visits to physical museums,
but many are also using museum websites to learn more about museums after a visit.
The relationship between museums and museum websites is complementary, and one
should not assume that online and in-house museum visitors need access to
completely different types of information resources. When developing information
resources for museum websites, it is important to consider the overlap between online
and in-house museum visitors, and create resources that meet the needs of all visitors,
including those planning and returning from museum visits.
The results also illustrate that online museum visitors understand the complicated
relationship that exists between museums and museum websites, and have clear
expectations of what they want museum websites to provide, both before and after
visiting a museum. Online museum visitors are increasingly living in a world where
the physical and virtual intersect and complement each other daily. For many online
museum visitors, virtual and physical museum resources can play off each other, such
that the whole is greater that the sum of the parts. When viewed from this perspective,
museum visitors will benefit most from websites that offer uniquely online features,
such as interactive, online exhibits, as well as information resources that encourage a
strong relationship with the physical museum, such as maps and driving directions.
At the same time, however, the need for museum websites to support online and inhouse museum activities reinforces the complexity of the relationship between
museums and their websites, especially since the information needs of a visitor are
likely to change as that visitor goes from online to in-house and back again. The
same visitor may want different things from the museum and the museum’s website,
as he or she proceeds through a cycle of visiting the museum and the museum’s
website repeatedly. One cannot assume that visitors using a website to plan their first
visit will need the same information as visitors planning their second visit, or that
they will be interested in the same exhibits, collections, and so on.
By realizing the complexities of the relationships between museums, museum
websites, and museum visitors before and after visits, by understanding that
information needs change as visitors move from online to in-house and back again,
and by tracking these changes carefully, museum professionals can better meet the

356

P. F. Marty

needs of all visitors. It is important for museum professionals to understand how the
needs of museum visitors change over time, and the results of this study can help
museum professionals cope with the changing worlds of museum visitors, in-house
and online-before, during, and after museum visits.
In particular, this study demonstrates how all museum professionals (including
curators, educators, web developers, etc.) can build on the lessons learned to develop
and strengthen a complementary and supportive relationship between museums and
museum websites. Encouraging such a relationship is important, not only because so
many online museum visitors visit museum websites before and after museum visits,
but also because so many online visitors use museum websites and the information
resources they provide to make decisions about whether or not they will visit the
museums in person. This discussion, therefore, concludes with three takeaway lessons
for museum professionals developing museum websites.
Needs and Expectations of Online Museum Visitors
Museum professionals must understand what museum visitors are looking for on
museum websites, before and after museum visits, and make these information
resources available and accessible on their website (cf. Kravchyna and Hastings
2002). Online museum visitors have specific and different needs and expectations of
museum websites before and after museum visits. Prior to a visit, for example, online
visitors are more likely to need information such as hours of operation or driving
directions, while after a visit they are more likely to want information about future
exhibits and special events. On the other hand, visitors are more likely to use online
tours of galleries before visits than after visits, and more likely to use online images of
artifacts after visits than before visits.
If museum professionals are to support a complementary relationship between
museums and museum websites, it is crucial to understand the differences between
pre-visit and post-visit needs and expectations. Given that many online visitors prior
to a visit have already decided to visit the museum, it is important to encourage this
decision. Given that most online visitor, after a visit, will have different needs, it
important to capitalize on those differences and find ways that will draw them back
for another visit. A poorly planned and badly designed museum website
can undermine the museum’s ability to connect with its visitors, before and after
museum visits, and it is important for museum professionals to offer information
resources suitable for the increasing number of museum visitors using museum
websites in order to augment the physical museum visit (cf. Bowen, Bennet, and
Johnson 1998).
Circumstances that Prompt Online Museum Visits
Museum professionals must understand the situations in which online museum
visitors are likely to visit museum websites before and after visiting museums, and use
these circumstances to their advantage when planning museum websites (cf. Thomas
and Carey 2005). While the results of the survey indicate that online museum visitors
are very likely to visit museum websites both before and after museum visits, they are
more likely to do so in some situations than others, and it is important for museum

Museum Websites and Museum Visitors

357

professionals planning websites to understand the differences, if they are to capitalize
on the circumstances that encourage online visitors to visit in person.
When viewed from this perspective, it is important to design websites that
specifically help those visitors who may be looking for museums to visit while on
vacation, are visiting museums unfamiliar to them, or visiting museums where the
exhibits change frequently (cf. Bowen 1999). As each of these situations will likely
require different approaches to website design, it is important for museum
webmasters to carefully study their representative online visitors, as well as the
situations in which they are more or less likely to visit museum websites before and
after museum visits. Along these lines, it is even possible that a well-designed website
will have the potential to recruit brand new visitors to a museum, including those
individuals who rarely, if ever, visit museums in person.
Characteristics of Museum Websites that Influence Museum Visits
Museum professionals must understand the characteristics of museum websites that
are likely to influence online museum visitors to visit a museum, and ensure their
websites employ these characteristics in ways that positively influence their museum’s
visitors. Given that the majority of online museum visitors are likely to use the
museum’s website to determine whether they want to visit the museum in person, the
design, development, and presentation of museum websites are of great importance
(cf. Haley Goldman and Schaller 2004). The finding that nearly one in five of the
survey respondents reported that they had decided not to visit a museum specifically
because of its website, underscores the website’s significance for the museum.
Certain characteristics of museum websites are more likely to influence museum
visits than others, and it is critical for museum professionals to understand these
differences (cf. Herman, Johnson, and Ockuly 2004). For example, the results of the
survey indicate that for many online museum visitors, the ability to search the
museum’s collections (an area of great effort for many museum professionals) is not
necessarily as important as the overall quality of the available information. Efforts to
improve information quality throughout the entire site, therefore, may more
positively influence online museum visitors than efforts to increase the amount of
collections data available online.
Despite the importance of these lessons, the most valuable lesson of this research
may be that reading about the results of research studies is not enough; museum
professionals still need to conduct their own user studies to learn as much as possible
about their own visitors, both online and in-house. While the results of this study
provide important findings about the relationships online museum visitors have with
museums and museum websites, museum professionals should not attempt to
apply the results of this research without first validating them with their own unique
set of museum visitors. Nothing can replace running one’s own study on one’s own
website.
Conclusions
The results of this study offer positive lessons for museums and museum
professionals attempting to build strong relationships with their visitors, online

and in-house. The majority of online museum visitors understand the role of the
website in encouraging this relationship, and are interested in developing a
complementary relationship with the museums and museum websites they visit.
Museum professionals should encourage their visitors by developing websites that
support their needs and expectations before, during, and after museum visits. Doing
so effectively means not neglecting the basic information resources that allow
cyclical, complementary relationships to build and develop.
These kinds of positive relationships are capable of developing on their own, and
the current state of museum websites in the lives of museum visitors seems to be
working fairly well. Museum visitors know what they want in-house and online, and
museum professionals are actively working to meet those needs and expectations.
While online museum visitors may judge a museum based on its website, they know
that the real prize lies in the museum, and they are not interested in supplanting
physical museums with virtual ones. Therefore, by developing complementary
resources that work together, both online and in-house, to support the needs of all
museum visitors, museum professionals will encourage more museum visits and
stronger relationships between museums and their visitors.

Acknowledgements
The author would like to acknowledge the assistance of the museum professionals who promoted this study
by linking to the online survey from their museums’ websites; without their assistance, this project would
never have reached such an international and broad range of online museum visitors. The author would
also like to acknowledge the contributions of the anonymous reviewers whose suggestions helped to
improve this manuscript.
