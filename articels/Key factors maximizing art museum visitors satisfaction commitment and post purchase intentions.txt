ABSTRACT

KEYWORDS

As there is a lack of empirical research examining art museum visitors’ post-purchase
behaviors, this study tested the theoretical associations among image congruence,
quality, affective experiences, satisfaction, and commitment to build a sturdy model
of behavioral intentions. The concept of involvement was also included as a
moderator. A field survey at art museums was conducted. The level of construct
validity and reliability for all variables were satisfactory. Results of the structural
model revealed that the proposed theoretical framework sufficiently accounted for
the variance in intentions. Satisfaction was of greatest importance in generating
intentions. Commitment and satisfaction acted as important mediators. Among
nine hypothesized direct linkages, eight hypotheses were supported. Findings from
the invariance model assessment supported the moderating influence of
involvement on the relationships among quality, satisfaction, commitment, and
intentions. The strength of such relationships among these variables was greater
when museum visitors’ involvement level was high.

Introduction
In an increasingly competitive and diversifying leisure
marketplace, the important challenge for most
museums comprising art galleries over the past few
decades is to maintain and increase the number of
visitors (Davidson & Sibley, 2011; Lynch, Burton,
Scott, Wilson, & Smith, 2000). Museums and art galleries are under the strong pressure to sustain visitor
numbers and enhance visit frequency to demonstrate
their role in bringing tourists to cities, generate
necessary revenue, and justify public funding
(Davidson & Sibley, 2011; Slater, 2007). Within this
environment, museum operations in recent years
have increasingly become visitor-oriented, developing
various marketing strategies that could possibly
appeal to both tourists and locals (Chan, 2009;
Chiappa, Ladu, Meleddu, & Pulina, 2013; Johnson,
2003). Museum practitioners are making diverse
endeavors to fortify the ties with the local community,
reach the broad public, and effectively compete with

other types of leisure activities (Gil & Ritchie, 2009).
Undoubtedly, art museums recently have paid much
more attention to retaining tourists through boosting
their commitment and loyalty (Brida, Pulina, & Riaño,
2012; Camarero & Garrido, 2011). Given this, a clear
understanding about what art museum offerings visitors expect and what makes them fulfilled with their
museum experiences, as well as which factors help
them make intentions to revisit and recommend the
museum is becoming increasingly necessary for
every art museum practitioner.
Indisputably, researchers in diverse fields have
employed a variety of perspectives to comprehend
the critical variables that enhance customer favorable
intentions for a firm and repeat patronage (Donovan &
Rossiter, 1982; Han & Hyun, 2012; Kasper & Lemmink,
1989; Oliver, 1997). Research into the extant consumer
behavior and marketing literature indicates that either
cognitive or affective model is somewhat limited in its
ability to sufficiently account for behavioral intentions

and post-purchase behaviors (Bigné, Mattila, &
Andreu, 2008; Ladhari, 2007; Oliver, 1997, 1999). Considering cognitive, affective, and conative processes
jointly is broadly believed to be crucial to clearly explicate the behavioral intention framework particularly
for the products with intangible characteristics (Han
& Hyun, 2012; Han, Kim, & Kim, 2011; Oliver, 1997,
1999). Consequently, it is essential to include cognitive
factors (e.g. image congruence and quality), affective
factors (e.g. affective responses and satisfaction), and
conative factors (e.g. commitment) when modeling
customers’ intention formation. Indeed, researchers
in prior studies asserted that image congruence
(Back & Lee, 2009; Sirgy & Su, 2000), quality (Eisingerich & Bell, 2008; Taylor & Baker, 1994), affective experiences (Chiu, Hsu, Lai, & Chang, 2012; Evanschitzky &
Wunderlich, 2006), satisfaction (Chen & Chen, 2010;
Cronin, Brady, & Hult, 2000), and commitment (Camarero & Garrido, 2011; Siu, Zhang, Dong, & Kwan, 2013)
are important factors driving force of customers’
post-purchase behavioral intentions.
Although their criticality has been emphasized,
little empirical research has investigated the possible
interrelationships among image congruence, quality,
affective experience, satisfaction, and commitment
in the formation of art museum visitors’ behavioral
intentions. To best of our knowledge, no research
has yet tested such intricate relationships in generating intentions in a single conceptual framework in
an art museum context. In addition, despite its
importance, the moderating effect of involvement
on satisfaction, commitment, and intention-generation processes has been somewhat overlooked.
Previous research has shown that involvement plays
a crucial role in consumer intention formation, particularly for the museum product (Edmonds, Muller,
& Connell, 2006; Taheri, Jafari, & O’Gorman, 2014).
How to enhance visitors’ involvement level is considered to be a vital question faced by museum practitioners. To fill these existing gaps in the extant
literature, in this study, we aimed to propose and
test a theoretical model explicating the formation
of art museum visitors’ behavioral intentions by considering the role of image congruence (social and
ideal social), quality, affective experiences, satisfaction, and commitment. We also attempted to identify
the moderating role of involvement within the proposed theoretical framework, to discover the relative
criticality of study variables in determining intentions,
and to test the mediating impact of research
variables.

Overall, this research focused on exploring the
relationships between image congruence, quality,
affect, satisfaction, commitment, and involvement in
the formation of museum visitors’ post-behavioral
intentions. A better understanding of such associations can provide practitioners’ insights into customers’ intention formation for repurchasing and
recommending a museum product, thereby helping
them adjust their service and marketing strategies to
meet customer wants and needs. In the next section,
the conceptual background and hypotheses are discussed. Research methods involving measures of
study variables, the data-collection procedure, and
the demographic profiles of the study samples are
then introduced. Subsequently, the statistical results
obtained from the quantitative analysis are then presented. After the Results section, a general discussion
of the implications for researchers and practitioners,
limitations, and some potential directions for future
studies are provided.

Literature review
Art museums and visitors
The museum is traditionally is regarded as an essential
facet of destination heritage for both travelers and
local population (Gil & Ritchie, 2009) and to be an
important aspect of cultural attractions (StylianouLambert, 2011). Thus, the association between
tourism and museums has been a vital research
topic for many years. Museums often serve as the
major attraction to travelers into many places, functioning as an economic development engine for destinations (Gil & Ritchie, 2009; Stylianou-Lambert,
2011). Indeed, museums comprising art galleries/
museums can be an important source of tourist attraction for urban areas with a relatively low tourism and
low economic profile (Brida et al., 2012). Recognizing
that art museums can be an effective marketing tool
for city/urban tourism, researchers have made efforts
to measure visitor experiences at an art museum,
loyalty for it, and its linkage to the destination community (Brida et al., 2012). According to Kim, Cheng, and
O’leary’s (2007), visitors of art museums tend to have
higher education level and household income level
than those who visit theme parks, amusement parks,
events, local fairs, and festivals. Moreover, compared
to visitors of other types of museums, art museum customers tend to have a better educational background
and higher income level and are more likely to be

professionals/students (Bennett, 1994; Schuster, 1991;
Stylianou-Lambert, 2011).

Image congruence
Researchers in diverse fields suggested that the
concept of image congruence should be integrated
into a framework/model explaining customers’ postpurchase intention or behavior (e.g. Back, 2005; Back
& Lee, 2009; Haj-Salem, Chebat, Michon, & Oliveira,
2016; Han & Hyun, 2013; Kaihatu & Spence, 2016;
Kumar, 2016; Sirgy & Su, 2000). These researchers
asserted that image congruence is an important
factor influencing cognitive, affective, and evaluation
processes and behavioral intention for post-purchase
behaviors. The significance of image congruence in
comprehending consumer behavior has been
reported in several hospitality and tourism contexts
such as hotels (Back, 2005), restaurants (Han & Hyun,
2013), country clubs (Back & Lee, 2009), and destination visitor studies (Sirgy & Su, 2000). The product personality should be tailored to the social/ideal selfconcept of target patrons (Back & Lee, 2009; Sirgy,
1982; Sirgy et al., 1997) as this matching process is
an efficient way to induce the positive assessment of
the product performances, elicit favorable affective
experiences, and trigger positive post-purchase behaviors for a firm/destination (Haj-Salem et al., 2016; Han
& Hyun, 2013; Kaihatu & Spence, 2016; Kumar, 2016;
Sirgy & Su, 2000).
Sirgy et al. (1997) and Sirgy (1982) indicated that
there are four major constituents of self-image (i.e.
social self-image, ideal social self-image, actual selfimage, and ideal self-image). Social self-image refers
to how one feels other people see him/herself; and
ideal self-image indicates how he/she would like
other people to see himself/herself (Jamal & Goode,
2001). Moreover, actual self-image refers to the
view an individual in fact has of himself/herself; and
ideal self-image indicates the ideal view an individual
would like to have of himself/herself (Jamal & Goode,
2001).
The self-concept comprising these four types of
self-image is regarded to be a crucial term for both
consumer behavior and social psychology. Of these
self-images, social self-image and ideal social selfimage are essential particularly for products and services whose characteristics are highly conspicuous
(Back, 2005; Ross, 1971). Consistent with this indication, Sirgy and Su (2000) and Jamal and Goode
(2001) asserted that unlike other self-concepts, social

and ideal social self-concepts can be regarded as
essential for highly conspicuous product/service in
that such product/service mostly relies heavily on
imagery. In hospitality and tourism, patrons’ consumption experience is likely to be shared with other customers due to its conspicuous characteristics (Back &
Lee, 2009; Han & Hyun, 2013). Undoubtedly, a
museum product contains highly conspicuous characteristics in nature. Consequently, using social image
congruence containing social self-image and ideal
social image congruence comprising ideal social selfimage can be appropriate in the museum context.
Sirgy (1982) defined this social image congruence as
“an equality between social self-image and product
image” (p. 291) and conceptualized the ideal social
image congruence as “an equality between ideal
social self-image and product image” (p. 291).
Image congruence indicates the matching concept
(Back, 2005; Sirgy, 1985). Customers tend to prefer a
service/product whose image matches their selfimage and often evaluate the performances of such
product/service attributes more positively (Back,
2005; Gardner & Levy, 1955; Haj-Salem et al., 2016;
Han & Hyun, 2015). In other words, when customers
feel high social image congruence, they are likely to
perceive that the product and its attributes
have high quality, having overall impression that
the product is relatively superior to other competing
ones (Back, 2005; Haj-Salem et al., 2016; Han &
Hyun, 2015).

Quality
Quality is an imperative concept in marketing and
consumer behavior (Eisingerich & Bell, 2008; Taylor &
Baker, 1994). Quality of a product/service along with
satisfaction has long been believed to be key constructs contributing to building positive intentions
and loyalty for a firm (Cong, 2016; Han & Hyun,
2015; Taylor & Baker, 1994). According to Taylor and
Baker (1994) and Han and Hyun (2015), quality refers
to patrons’ general impressions regarding the relative
excellence/superiority of a product/service and its performances over competing products/services and
their performances. As implied in this definition, the
concept of quality includes individuals’ perception/
cognition (Oliver, 1997). In most studies in marketing,
consumer behavior, and tourism, the term “quality” is
thus often interchangeably used with “perceived
quality”. Likewise, quality in the present study indicates visitors’ overall impressions/perceptions of

ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH

relative excellence in a museum product and the performances of its attributes as compared to other
museums. Customers willingly revisit a museum if
they perceive that the quality of their experiences at
a museum is high (Jeong & Lee, 2006; Siu et al., 2013).

Affective experiences
Research over the past few decades has placed
growing emphasis on the vital role of affect in explaining consumer behavior (Ladhari, 2007). A considerable
amount of effort has been made to understand the
intricate role of affect in diverse fields comprising marketing, consumer behavior, and hospitality/tourism
(Chiu et al., 2012; Evanschitzky & Wunderlich, 2006;
Jani & Han, 2014; Ladhari, 2007; Oliver, 1980; Westbrook & Oliver, 1991). The significance of the term,
affect, has been frequently stressed in consumer satisfaction and post-purchase behavior research
(Evanschitzky & Wunderlich, 2006; Ladhari, 2007;
Oliver, 1980; Westbrook & Oliver, 1991). Oliver (1997)
described affect as one’s positive attitude toward a
service/product and the performances of its attributes
and emotional fulfillment response to the performances. According to Oliver (1997, 1999) and Han,
Back, and Barrett (2009), despite its greater scope,
this affect is used interchangeable with emotion in
the extant literature. The cognition-centered notion
of satisfaction/intention-generation procedure has
been rapidly replaced by the affect-centered view,
which indicates that customers’ affective experiences
are core in explaining their post-purchase behavior
(Han et al., 2009; Hyun, Han, & Kim, 2016).

Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction has long been regarded to be
an important driver of diverse post-purchase intentions/behaviors that are favorable for a firm
(Brunner, Stöcklin, & Opwis, 2008; Chen & Chen,
2010). In past studies, a positive influence of customer
satisfaction has been reported on repurchase intention, word-of-mouth behavior, repeat patronage, willingness to pay or pay more, and retention (e.g.
Anderson & Sullivan, 1993; Chen & Chen, 2010;
Cronin et al., 2000; Oliver, 1997, 1999). Patrons’ intentions and behaviors deeply rely on the satisfaction
evaluation of their general experiences with
product/service attributes (Oliver, 1980). According
to Jones, Mothersbaugh, and Beatty (2000), customer
satisfaction is “an overall evaluation of performance

837

based on all prior experiences with a firm” (p. 260).
This satisfaction is thus different from affect whose
main concept comprises fulfillment emotional
responses (Oliver, 1997, 1999). Yet, satisfaction can
be categorized as affective process as its one of the
main aspects is the evaluation of such emotional
responses (Han & Hyun, 2015). Indeed, Han and
Hyun (2015) described satisfaction as travelers’ assessment of the overall product or service consumption
experiences mainly comprising emotional or affective
experiences. In the same vein, satisfaction in this study
refers to visitors’ evaluation of their total/overall
experiences involving emotional experiences at
a museum.

Commitment
Commitment refers to a state where “an exchange
partner believing that an ongoing relationship with
another is so important as to warrant maximum
efforts at maintaining it” (Morgan & Hunt, 1994,
p. 23). One’s enduring desire to keep a valued relation
with the exchange partner is a key aspect of commitment (Morgan & Hunt, 1994). The high level of
relationship commitment is likely to lead to maintain
an existing relationship in that the committed party
often believes that keeping the current relationship
is worthy enough (Lai, 2015). Commitment is believed
to result both from economic concern regarding the
exchange relationship and from favorable relationship
interaction (Siu et al., 2013). According to Fullerton
(2005), such commitment is a psychological force
that relates consumers to the organization that they
do business with. In the museum industry, commitment is an expression of visitors’ willingness/desire
to engage in the relationship with a museum; and
building a high level of commitment is an essential
process in establishing and upholding long-term
relations with visitors (Camarero & Garrido, 2011; Siu
et al., 2013). Accordingly, developing a committed
relationship with visitors is one of the fundamental
goals of museum operations.

Behavioral intentions
Individuals’ post-purchase behaviors are highly associated with intentions for such behaviors, and thus
behavioral intentions are viewed as a significant indicator of actual consumer behaviors (Ajzen, 1991;
Kasper & Lemmink, 1989). Oliver (1997) defined
behavioral intentions as consumers’ stated likelihood

838

H. HAN AND S. S. HYUN

to conduct a certain behavior. Donovan and Rossiter
(1982) described behavioral intentions are related to
how likely customers are to repurchase the product/
service and how likely customers are to recommend
it to others. These intention dimensions are also
often regarded to be main aspects of assessing customer loyalty (Lai, 2015). Given these, behavioral intentions in this study refer to visitors’ affirmed
likelihood to revisit a particular art museum and
encourage family, friends, and others to visit the
museum. According to Dirsehan (2012), visitors who
have fulfilled experiences at a museum intend to
repeatedly visit the museum and say positive things
about it to others. Boosting these positive behavioral
intentions is thus an important requisite for successful
museum operations.

Impact of image congruence
Previous studies in diverse contexts have indicated
that integrating image congruence into the customer
decision-making framework and discovering the particular role of this construct, whose nature is cognitive,
in offering a sound understanding of the loyalty/intention-generation process (Back, 2005; Back & Lee, 2009;
Jamal & Goode, 2001; Peng, Wong, & Wan, 2012; Sirgy
et al., 1997). Studies in an extensive body of literature
often relate image congruence to quality and affect. In
particular, Back (2005) found that image congruence
influences satisfaction evaluation and attitudinal
loyalty for a hotel brand. In his study, a main aspect
of attitudinal loyalty comprises quality, affective
experiences, and behavioral intention, and image congruence was utilized as the matching between hotel
brand image and guests’ social self-image/ideal
social self-image. Peng et al. (2012) indicated that consumers’ quality assessment of a product/brand is a
positive and significant function of the magnitude of
congruence between the product/brand image and
consumer self-image. According to them, customers
who perceive the product/brand image to be congruent with their self-image are likely to have a positive
overall impression regarding the quality of the
product and its performances and are often
motivated to purchase it. This empirical evidence supports the notion that quality is a function of image
congruence.
Another research stream supporting the important
role of image congruence lies on emotion research in
marketing and consumer behavior. The degree of
affect for a product/service is likely to be formed

based on consumers’ cognitive evaluation of its performances and the attractiveness of its attributes
(Evanschitzky & Wunderlich, 2006). That is, cognitive
assessment of a product/service stimulates affective
evaluation of it (Oliver, 1999). According to Chiu
et al. (2012), individuals’ cognitive assessment
process stimulates affective responses and such cognitive and affective processes determine the level of
satisfaction. In a consistent fashion, in a hotel
setting, Jani and Han (2014) demonstrated that cognition exerted a significant influence on affect, and both
variables are key drivers of guest satisfaction. These
studies contribute to the important research stream
on the cognitive determinant of affect and suggest
that cognition is of utmost importance in eliciting
affect and satisfaction in customers’ post-purchase
intention formation. Accordingly, recognizing the cognitive nature of image congruence, it is plausible to
assume a positive link between image congruence
and affective experiences.

Relationship between quality and satisfaction
Researchers agree that both quality and satisfaction
experiences provide customers an affirmative reason
to repeatedly purchase a product and recommend it
to others (Bitner, 1990; Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Hyun,
2010; Lai, 2015; Ryu & Han, 2010; Ting, 2004). Cronin
and Taylor (1992) identified the significant association
between quality and satisfaction, by demonstrating
that patrons’ behavioral intentions are considerably
influenced by this quality and satisfaction relationship.
In a restaurant context, Ryu and Han (2010) also verified the positive association between quality attributes (food, service, and physical environments) and
satisfaction evaluation in the formation of diners’
behavioral intentions. Highly perceived quality leads
to increased satisfaction, amplifying favorable intentions for a firm (Han & Hyun, 2015). This evidence supports the notion that customer satisfaction is a
significant function of quality.

Relationship between affective experiences
and satisfaction
The importance of understanding satisfaction as a
function of affective experiences has been repeatedly
highlighted in consumer behavior, marketing, and
tourism literature (Bigné et al., 2008; Chen, Lehto, &
Choi, 2009; Deng, Yeh, & Sung, 2013; Oliver, 1997). In
tourism, Chen et al. (2009) identified that travelers’

ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH

affective responses along with cognition directly influence their satisfaction. In a hospitality context, Deng
et al. (2013) empirically demonstrated the criticality
of emotional experiences in determining satisfaction.
Contributing to the crucial research stream on affective determinant of satisfaction, these studies all
suggest that customers’ affective experiences are as
important as cognition in determining satisfaction in
the formation of customers’ post-behavioral intentions. Consumers holding favorable affect for a particular product/service tend to be more satisfied; and
their positive intentions for the product/service often
reaches the highest level when their positive
emotional experiences are high (Bigné et al., 2008;
Chen et al., 2009; Oliver, 1997).

Relationships among satisfaction,
commitment, and behavioral intentions
Satisfaction and commitment have long been
regarded as a vital determinant of behavioral intentions (Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Hyun & Perdue, 2017;
Oliver, 1999). In a chain restaurant context, Hyun
(2010) recognized that patrons’ satisfaction level significantly increases their behavioral intentions. This
satisfaction is also believed to be an important antecedent of commitment (Oliver, 1999). According to
Bansal, Irving, and Taylor (2004), a strong level of commitment for a product/service derives from a high
level of satisfaction with the product/service use. In a
hospitality context, Lai (2015) demonstrated that satisfaction and commitment are positively associated;
and this relationship significantly increases the level
of customer loyalty. When customers positively
assess their various experiences with a product/
service, and therefore their level of satisfaction is
high, it is likely that their commitment level and readiness to repurchase the product/service increase
(Bansal et al., 2004; Han & Hyun, 2015; Lai, 2015).
Accordingly, improving customer satisfaction based
on their total assessment of overall consumption
experiences is undoubtedly imperative to gain a
higher level of commitment, repeat business, and
loyalty (Choi, Ok, & Hyun, 2017; Han & Hyun, 2015;
Hyun & Park, 2016; Lai, 2015; Zhang, Ye, Song, &
Liu, 2015).

Involvement and its impact
While the definition of involvement varies, the
general consensus is that it refers to the degree of

839

flow, concentration, engagement, and interest stimulated by a particular experience or activity (Novak,
Hoffman, & Duhachek, 2003). In this regard, the
term involvement is often alternatively utilized with
flow, absorption, and immersion in the existing literature. For instance, Csikszentimihalyi (1975) and Bilgihan, Nusair, Okumus, and Cobanoglu (2015)
described flow as a state where individuals behave
with a sense of deep involvement, concentration,
and total engagement. According to Hsu and Lu
(2004), it is quite usual that individuals are concentrated on the activity itself and their awareness is
extremely narrowed to such activity when their involvement level is high. Similarly, Novak et al. (2003)
indicated that individuals whose involvement state
is high are likely to be wholly absorbed/immersed
in a particular activity. Involvement has been widely
employed as an important concept in a variety of
activities/experiences such as online service use,
leisure/sports, shopping, hospitality product use,
and museums since individuals’ experiences can be
optimized when highly involved (e.g. Bilgihan et al.,
2015; Edmonds et al., 2006; Hsu & Lu, 2004; Jung &
Yoon, 2012; Taheri et al., 2014).
In a consumption situation, patrons’ level of involvement in a product/service influences their intention formation and purchase behavior (Kokkinaki,
1999; Novak, Hoffman, & Yung, 2000). Since involvement was first introduced to consumer behavior
and marketing, this concept has been also broadly
employed as a moderator (Bian & Moutinho, 2008).
Researchers identified that the consumer intentiongeneration process is under the influence of the
high/low involvement condition, demonstrating a
moderating role of involvement (Browne & Kaldenberg, 1997; Dholakia, 1998). According to Bian and
Moutinho (2008), the relationship between customers’ perceptions/cognition and behavioral intentions becomes stronger under the high involvement
condition than the low involvement situation. Tuu
and Olsen (2010) empirically identified that the
level of consumer involvement significantly moderated the causal relationships among satisfaction,
repurchase intention, and loyalty. Consistently, in a
hospitality context, Jung and Yoon (2012) indicated
that patrons who feel a higher level of product involvement showed a stronger impact on the links
among satisfaction, loyalty, and behavioral intention
for switching than those who feel a lower level of
involvement. Researchers in these studies asserted
that if the level of product involvement is high,

840

H. HAN AND S. S. HYUN

customers’ intention formation is likely to be favorable, and variables within the intention-generation
framework are more strongly associated. It is also
widely known that visitors’ museum experience and
evaluation of it are likely to be optimized when the
museum provides an environment in which visitors
can be highly involved in the experience (Edmonds
et al., 2006; Taheri et al., 2014).

Hypotheses
Given the importance of image congruence, quality,
affective experiences, satisfaction, and commitment
and the feasible relationships among these variables
based on a thorough literature review discussed
above, we developed a total of 10 research hypotheses. Of them, nine hypotheses regard the relationships among predictors of intentions (H1–H9) and
one (H10a–e) regards the moderating impact of
involvement.
H1: Social image congruence is positively related to
quality.
H2: Ideal social image congruence is positively related to
quality.
H3: Social image congruence is positively related to affective experiences.
H4: Ideal social image congruence is positively related to
affective experiences.
H5: Quality is positively related to satisfaction.
H6: Affective experiences are positively related to
satisfaction.
H7: Satisfaction is positively related to commitment.
H8: Satisfaction is positively related to behavioral
intentions.
H9: Commitment is positively related to behavioral
intentions.
H10a: Involvement significantly moderates the relationship between quality and satisfaction.
H10b: Involvement significantly moderates the relationship between affective experiences and satisfaction.
H10c: Involvement significantly moderates the relationship between satisfaction and commitment.
H10d: Involvement significantly moderates the relationship between satisfaction and behavioral intentions.
H10e: Involvement significantly moderates the relationship between commitment and behavioral intentions.

Methods
Tools
The utilized measures in the survey questionnaire
were adopted from the extant literature. All responses
were given on a seven-step Likert scale from “Extremely disagree” (1) to “Extremely agree” (7). Multiple
items were used to measure every construct. Specifically, four items employed from Sirgy et al. (1997)
were used to evaluate social and ideal social image
congruence. Three items for the assessment of
quality were adopted from Taylor and Baker (1994).
Four measurement items concerned the degree of
affective experiences. These items were borrowed
from Dirsehan (2012) and Oliver (1997).
Satisfaction was evaluated with three items
employed from Oliver (1980) and Taylor and Baker
(1994). Three items concerning the degree of commitment level were adopted from Morgan and Hunt
(1994) and Oliver (1997). Involvement was measured
with three items from Koufaris (2002) and Webster,
Trevino, and Ryan (1993). Four items were used for
the assessment of behavioral intentions, which were
employed from Ajzen (1991) and Zeithaml, Berry,
and Parasuraman (1996). The survey questionnaire
includes these measures, introductory letter, and
questions for socio-demographic characteristics. The
initial questionnaire was pre-tested with tourism academics who are frequent museum visitors and was
improved slightly based on their feedback. Lastly,
the questionnaire was thoroughly reviewed by
tourism academics and industry experts. A minor
amendment was made based on their feedback. The
measures utilized in the present research are displayed in Appendix.

Procedures
A visitor’s survey was conducted at five museums in a
metropolitan city, South Korea. These museums are considered major art museums and are well known to the
public. These museums have adequate level of reputation/image, have acceptable level of physical environments, and have relatively more rest areas than other art
museums/galleries (Kim, 2013; Kim & Han, 2015). In
addition, the characteristics and services of the
museums considered to be similar. Moreover, these
museums have somewhat greater number of visitors
and more often exhibit famous paintings and other artworks as compared to other art museums/galleries (Kim,
2013). The museums are located in a metropolitan city

ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH

where other competing museums in different types and
diverse holiday leisure options are available. Surveyors
were well-trained students majoring in hospitality and
tourism. They approached actual visitors who were in
rest areas and cafés of the art museums, explained the
research in a brief manner, and requested the visitors
to participate in our survey. When the visitors showed
willingness toward participation, the surveyors provided
a thorough explanation of the research purposes and
instructions regarding filling out the questionnaire.
The survey questionnaire was given to the respondents
and returned onsite for the enhancement of the
response rate. Approximately 450 survey questionnaires
were delivered to art museum customers through this
procedure, and 355 completed responses were
returned. Among them, a total of 10 unusable responses
were sorted out. Our usable sample size was 345 completed cases (usable response rate = 76.7%). These
responses were utilized for data analysis.

Participants
Among 345 respondents, 43.9% were male visitors and
56.1% were female visitors. The participants’ age
ranged from 18 years old to 76 years old. The mean
age was about 30.1 years old. In terms of their annual
income level, 23.3% reported the income under
$24,999; 17.9% indicated the income between $40,000
and $54,999; 16.1% reported between $25,000 and
$39,999 (16.1%); 15.8% indicated between $55,000
and $69,999; 11.5% reported income above $100,000;
8.8% indicated between $70,000 and $84,999; and
6.7% reported between $85,000 and $99,999. Most of
the respondents were highly educated. In particular,
the majority of them reported that they have a university
degree (69.7%). About 14.0% indicated that they are
graduate-degree holders. About 7.9% reported that
they are 2-year college/some college graduates. Only
8.5% of the respondents indicated that they hold a
high school diploma or less. The survey participants’
average art museum visit frequency for the past 3
years was 5.6 times.

Results
Reliability and validity assessment
To generate a measurement model, a confirmatory
factor analysis was run with a maximum likelihood estimation method using the AMOS version 20 software
package. The measurement model was found to

841

adequately fit to the data (χ 2 = 483.952, df = 221,
p < .001, χ 2/df = 2.190, RMSEA = .059, CFI = .961, IFI
= .961, TLI = .951). A composite reliability was calculated
to evaluate if the measurement items for each construct
are internally coherent. Our calculations revealed that all
values of composite reliability are higher than the standard value of .600 (see Table 1). The standardized loadings of all measurement items on the corresponding
latent factors were statistically significant and positive
(p < .01). Construct validity was subsequently evaluated.
Average variance extracted (AVE) values were calculated. As shown in Table 1, our calculation indicated
that all AVE values for study constructs were higher
than the Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) recommended
threshold of .500, and all items within construct were
significantly loaded on their respective latent construct
(p < .01). This result supported convergent validity.
Discriminant validity was then evaluated through
the comparison between the AVE values and the
between-construct squared correlations. All betweenconstruct squared correlations were found to be less
than the AVE values, thus supporting the sufficient discriminant validity. Overall, the assessment of the
measurement model showed satisfactory model fit,
composite reliability, and construct validity.

Hypothesis testing
A structural model was generated with a maximum
likelihood estimation approach. The structural model
included a satisfactory fit (χ 2 = 511.112, df = 176,
p < .001, χ 2/df = 2.904, RMSEA = .074, CFI = .944, IFI
= .945, TLI = .933). The hypothesized associations
within the proposed theoretical framework were
tested. Table 2 and Figure 1 include details regarding
the findings from the structural model assessment.
Hypotheses 1 and 2 posited that social and ideal
social image congruence is positively associated with
quality. As proposed, the links from social (H1:
β = .257, p < .01) and ideal social image congruence
(H2: β = .429, p < .01) to quality were positive and significant. Thus, hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported.
Two image congruence factors explained 44.3% of
the variance in quality. Hypotheses 3 and 4 assumed
that social and ideal social image congruence is significantly related to affective experiences. As expected,
the path between ideal social image congruence
and affective experiences was positive and significant
(H4: β = .446, p < .01). Yet, the link between social
image congruence and affective experiences was not
significant (H3: β = .020, p > .05). Thus, while

of the structural model indicated that both quality

(H5: β = .523, p < .01) and affective experiences (H6:

satisfaction. Therefore, hypotheses 5 and 6 were

and 9 posited that satisfaction, commitment, and
behavioral intentions are positively associated. As
proposed, satisfaction positively influenced commitment (H7: β = .762, p < .01) and behavioral intentions (H8: β = .168, p < .01); and commitment
significantly affected behavioral intentions (H9:
β = .598, p < .01). Thus, hypotheses 7, 8, and 9
were supported. About 58.1% of the variance in
commitment was explained by its drivers. Research
variables within our theoretical framework
accounted for about 53.8% of the total variance
in behavioral intentions.
The indirect impact and total impact of research
variables were assessed. As reported in Table 2, satisfaction (β = .456, p < .01), quality (β = .326, p < .01),
affective experiences (β = .119, p < .01), and ideal
social image congruence (β = .193, p < .05) had a significant indirect influence on behavioral intentions.
In addition, quality (β = .399, p < .01), affective experiences (β = .146, p < .01), social image congruence
(β = .106, p < .05), and ideal social image congruence
(β = .236, p < .01) exerted a significant indirect
impact on commitment. Moreover, both social
(β = .139, p < .05) and ideal social image congruence
(β = .310, p < .01) included a significant direct influence
on satisfaction. These findings imply that commitment,
satisfaction, quality, and affective commitment acted as
significant mediators within the proposed research framework. In terms of the total impact, as shown in Table
2, satisfaction had the greatest total influence on

intentions (β = .623, p < .01), closely followed by commitment (β = .598, p < .01).

Invariance model assessment
A measurement invariance test was conducted. The
survey responses were split into high (n = 235) and
low (n = 110) groups of involvement by using a
K-means cluster analysis. A non-restricted model was
initially generated. As reported in Table 3, the model
included a satisfactory fit to the data (χ 2 = 719.356,
df = 330, p < .001, χ 2/df = 2.180, RMSEA = .059, CFI
= .937, IFI = .938, TLI = .920). Next, a full-metric invariance model was generated. This model also fit to
the data adequately (χ 2 = 754.712, df = 344, p < .001,
χ 2/df = 2.194, RMSEA = .059, CFI = .933, IFI = .934, TLI
= .919). Two models were compared by using a chisquare difference test. Results indicated that the
non-restricted model and full-metric invariance
model are not different significantly (Δχ 2 (14) =
35.356, p > .001). Full-metric invariance was therefore
supported.
Afterward, a structural invariance test was conducted. A baseline model rooted in the full-metric
invariance model where all factor loadings are
restricted to be equal was generated by adding the
hypothesized links among constructs. As reported in
Table 3 and Figure 2, the baseline model was found
to have an acceptable fit to the data (χ 2 = 870.180,
df = 366, p < .001, χ 2/df = 2.378, RMSEA = .063, CFI

in which a particular relationship is set to be equivalent between high and low involvement groups.
Results from the chi-square test revealed that the
quality and satisfaction relationship significantly differed between two groups (Δχ 2 [1] = 4.023, p < .05);
the satisfaction and commitment association was significantly different across groups (Δχ 2 [1] = 4.510, p

Discussion and implications
Despite its importance for conspicuous products such
as the art museum product, the concept of image congruence has received scant attention in the extant
museum literature. Our study offered an empirical verification for the decisive role of social and ideal social
image congruence in developing an intention formation that is positive for art museums. Our findings
showed that a high level of congruence between
social and ideal social self-images and product
image elicits museum visitors’ positive affective
experiences, increases a favorable assessment of
quality, and induces a favorable evaluation about
their overall experience with the art museum
product; such high congruence also contributes to
increased commitment and intentions to revisit and
recommend indirectly through affect/quality and satisfaction. In sum, our findings empirically supported
for the results of existing studies in marketing and
consumer behavior, which utilized the self-concept/
image congruence theory and identified its impact
on consumer intention formation and post-purchase
behavior. This research is one of the few quantitative
studies that demonstrated the direct image congruence-quality/affect relationship. In addition, to best
of our knowledge, this study was the first to explore
the influence of image congruence on the museum
visitors’ post-purchase intention formation. Hence,
theoretically, our research is of utmost significance.
Practically, first, practitioners should imbue their
museum with a clear product personality. The
product personality needs to be tailored to the
social/ideal social self-concept of target customers.
Accordingly, practitioners should identify the social/
ideal social self-concept of these target customers
and build a museum product personality through promotion to match the social/ideal social self-concept of
their customers. This image matching process can be

845

an effective marketing tool for increasing visitors’
quality assessment, emotional experiences, satisfaction evaluation, commitment, and intentions to be
loyal for art museums.
In line with Oliver’s (1997, 1999), three sequential
stages of intention generation (i.e. cognitive process
comprising image/image congruence and quality,
affective process involving affective/emotional and
satisfactory experiences, and conative process comprising commitment and intentions), our results
revealed that these processes are vital in explaining
museum visitors’ post-purchase behaviors. Moving
one step further, the present research successfully
deepened Oliver’s (1997, 1999) theoretical foundation by exploring the interrelationships between
variables within cognitive, affective, and conative
processes, which has been rarely carried out in the
existing literature. Overall, our empirical findings
provide strong support for the theorization
that variables within cognition, constructs within
affect, and variables within conation are significantly
interrelated. That is, the image congruence –
quality association (cognitive process) influences
the
affective
experiences
–
satisfaction
relationship (affective process) which influences the
commitment and intention association (conative
process).
The results of this study indicated that visitor satisfaction is a prominent construct whose relative criticality in determining behavioral intentions is
stronger than other variables within our proposed
framework. From a theoretical perspective, it seems
to be essential for museum researchers to actively
involve satisfaction as a key concept when developing a robust theoretical framework explicating
museum visitors’ intention formation and purchase
behavior. Practically, as demonstrated in the
present study, increasing social and ideal social
image congruence, quality, and affective experiences
will be an important way to boost visitors’ satisfaction. However, recognizing that these variables’
accountability of the total variance in satisfaction
was somewhat low in our research (37.2%),
museum operators should also seek other means
to maximize visitors’ satisfactory experiences. According to the extant museum research (Brida et al., 2012;
Chan, 2009; Dirsehan, 2012), such experiences as
novelty, learning/education, sensory, and entertainment/relax are of great importance in improving customers’ overall level of satisfaction during their
museum visit. For art museum operators, offering

846

H. HAN AND S. S. HYUN

these experiences to visitors along with providing
quality and affective experiences would result in a
significant increase in visitor satisfaction.
Theoretically, the mechanism underlying the intricate relationships between quality, affective experiences, satisfaction, and commitment in forming
behavioral intentions for art museum products is
rarely examined. In this study, we successfully
explored the moderation mechanism of involvement
influencing the quality, satisfaction, commitment,
and intention associations. Our convoluted theoretical
mechanism in general indicated that at the similar
level of quality assessment visitors show a stronger
satisfaction, build higher commitment, and form
stronger intentions if their involvement level is high.
From a practical perspective, recognizing the important moderating nature of involvement, the museum
operators should make every endeavor to offer high
involvement experiences to their customers. As our
findings indicated, when visitors are intensely
absorbed and deeply engrossed in the exhibits of art
museum, they will be more likely to perceive that
quality of the museum is excellent, be satisfied with
their experiences at the museum, be deeply committed to the museum, and have strong intentions
to revisit the museum and say positive things about
it. Moreover, practitioners should actively find visitors
who have had high involvement experiences while
visiting their museum through a short user survey.
These customers need to be targeted with special
programs or incentives. In doing so, these visitors’
positive behavioral intention formation would be
further strengthened.
Results from the indirect impact assessment indicated that commitment, satisfaction, quality, and
affective experiences played an important mediating
role in the proposed theoretical framework. These
findings imply that boosting the level of commitment, satisfaction, quality, and affective experiences
is an essential step in the intention-generation
process in that these variables maximize the influence of its antecedents on behavioral intentions.
Research that offers empirical evidence regarding
the mediating impact of these variables is not abundant in an art museum sector. The present study
thus includes theoretical implications. For researchers, the mediating nature of these variables should
be cautiously considered when building a sturdy
theoretical framework explaining museum visitors’
intention-generation process and behavior. Our findings are also practically significant since it discovered

that efficiently dealing with commitment, satisfaction, quality, and affective experiences is important
to ensure the maximum use of each mediator’s antecedent(s) in boosting visitors’ favorable behavioral
intentions for museums.
Some limitations of the present study should be
noted. First, the sample of this research was drawn
from the art museum industry. Thus, generalizing
the research findings to other tourism/leisure industries should be done in a cautious manner. Future
research testing our research model or extended
model on other types of tourism/leisure/holiday activities is thus needed. Second, in this study, demographic characteristics of the survey respondents
were not evenly based on their education level. In particular, about 69.7% and 14.0% of the survey participants were university graduates and graduatedegree holders, respectively. It is generally known
that the education level of art museum visitors’
tends to be higher than visitors of theme parks, local
events, festivals, etc. (Kim et al., 2007). Nevertheless,
to employ data that are more evenly distributed in
terms of education level, future studies still need to
include a greater number of survey participants with
diverse educational backgrounds. Lastly, in the
present study, the survey was conducted at five art
museums located in one metropolitan city. While the
museums are regarded to have higher reputation
and better facilities than other art museums/galleries
in the city, this limits our capability to generalize
the findings of this study. Future research should
include more number of art museums in diverse geographical areas.

Conclusion
Our knowledge of art museum customers’ post-purchase intention formation is very limited. Likewise, in
the tourism literature on museums, the role of image
congruity, quality, affect, satisfaction, commitment,
and involvement is not sufficiently documented. Our
results provide useful insights to tourism researchers
and practitioners in comprehending art museum visitors’ post-purchase intention-generation process. The
present research has three profound meanings in
museums, which is an important dimension of the
tourism industry. First, the findings of this study documented the importance of image congruence in art
museum customers’ intention formation. Second, our
research combined the emerging cognitive, affective,
and conative procedures of decision-making and

image-congruity theory into one sturdy conceptual
model. Third, the theoretical framework of museum
visitors’ intention formation was deepened by the
demonstrated moderating impact of involvement.
