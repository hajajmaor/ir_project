Abstract

This thesis is about Location Based Computing Systems (LBCS), with emphasis
on their underlying positioning systems. The first part of the thesis introduces a
three-layered reference model for discussing LBCS, and gives background infor-
mation on positioning systems in general—components, designs, properties, and
techniques. It also includes an overview of existing systems for indoor positioning.
The second part of the thesis introduces a case study, which consists of two parts.
One is an in-depth overview of a specific Location Based Service (LBS) called a
mobile electronic tour guide, a service typically implemented on hand-held devices
which are given to visitors at different exhibitions as a means for enhancing their
experience of it. This results in a requirements specification. The other part of
the case is a detailed description of a given museum, as an example of an indoor
exhibition.
The third part of this thesis is an analysis of existing positioning solutions against
the requirements specification and museum description. Based on the learning
from this analysis, two proposals are provided. The first is a decision flow diagram
which can help future developers to choose positioning system for a given LBS.
The other is the proposal of a system wide service oriented architecture for future
LBCSs, which can improve on the short-comings of existing systems’ ability to
accomodate various environments and services.

Introduction

Context-aware computing is a computing paradigm in which services can discover
and take advantage of contextual information. Context is defined in [1] as any
information that can be used to characterise the situation of an entity. This means
that almost any information available at the time of an interaction can be seen as
context information, such as time of day, noise level, who you are with, accessible
devices, and availability of resources like battery, display, network, or bandwidth.
An example of contextual information is given in figure 1.1 on the following page.


Services that can extract, interpret and use contextual information are said to be
context-aware. One of the most used types of context is location. A large range of
services are based on knowing where something or somebody is—they are location
aware, or location based. The latter term has recently become the more common,
and will be used throughout this thesis.
Location based services (LBSs) can be divided into several categories. These are
given below with examples for each category:

Navigation Car navigation with best-route suggestion or indoor navigation sup-
     port in large buildings using an electronic map, e.g. in museums, plants or
     hospitals.
Location-sensitive information Digital distribution of content to mobile devices
     based on their location, like weather cast services, routing of telephone calls,
     mobile advertising, and electronic museum guides which allow a visitor
     equipped with a mobile device to get additional information about the arte-
     facts in close proximity to him.
Tracking Tracking of people or valuable assets, like children, elderly people and
     expensive equipment, or tracking of large amounts of objects in supply chain
     management or in a warehouse.

Figure 1.1: Different types of contextual information can be utilised to enhance
services.

Security Monitoring and access control.

Directory services Where in this building is the nearest printer? Where is the
      nearest hairdresser saloon?

Emergency services A mobile user can call for assistance and at the same time
    automatically reveal his exact location to the emergency service called, like
    police, ambulance, automotive assistance, etc.

To be able to provide such location based services, we need an underlying position
sensing system, henceforth only referred to as the positioning system. In chapter 2
(see section 2.1 on page 9) we will define and discuss the use of the words position
and location in detail.
The satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) is the prevalent of all current
positioning systems. It enables a GPS receiver anywhere on earth to determine its
position free of charge with an accuracy within 15 metres. This is sufficient for a
wide range of services—according to an article published in Scientific American
May 2004 [2], GPS now serves more than 30 million users worldwide. The big
disadvantage with GPS is that because the receiver needs line of sight to at least
four satellites in the sky, it won’t work inside buildings or in other cases where
there are obstructions between the GPS receiver and the satellites. In addition, the
accuracy is too low for most LBSs used in indoor environments.
A lot of research in the cellular telephone networks community the last few years
have been focused on how these networks can be used for positioning. These sys-
tems have the advantage of functioning both indoors and outdoors, but as with GPS
                                                                                    3

they typically lack the accuracy needed for indoor use. One of the best solutions
presented this far has an accuracy of 5 metres [3].
This thesis addresses the field of Location Based Computing Systems (LBCSs) for
indoor environments. An LBCS consists of one or more location based services
(LBSs), and the underlying technologies used to realise them. As we saw above, a
large range of LBSs exist. These put different requirements on the underlying po-
sitioning technology. In this thesis, we will focus on LBSs in the domain of indoor
exhibitions, like museums, galleries, fairs, and the like. In recent years, a lot of
research has been performed in this domain, especially on mobile electronic tour
guides (see figure 1.2). A mobile electronic tour guide is a means for enhancing
the experience of a visitor to an exhibition, for example a museum. The visitor will
be equipped with an electronic device with a screen, which can communicate to its
user where he or she is on a map. It can also provide the visitor with information
about the different artefacts he or she is looking at. The reason for choosing the
exhibitions domain and electronic tour guides is that they face the underlying po-
sitioning system with all the typical requirements all indoor LBSs do. In addition,
they have the more specific requirements needed to support a service which pro-
vides the user with information about the artefacts in his immediate surroundings,
which adds an extra challenge to the positioning system. As it is likely that LBSs
will be more and more advanced, we choose a complex LBS which help us reveal
requirements posed to the positioning technology and the challenges faced in this
area.
Many indoor positioning systems exist, representing a broad range of different
positioning techniques and technologies. The problem is that current systems often
are results of research that focus on solving one specific property of the positioning
4                                                CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

system, typically at the cost of sacrificing other important properties. For example,
positioning systems with millimetre accuracy exist, but they are so expensive that
only the military or film industry can afford them. Another example is systems
that do not need any wired infrastructure. This makes them easy to install, but at
the cost of time-consuming maintaining as batteries need to be replaced at all the
wireless infrastructure nodes. Another problem with this field of research is that it
is relatively young. A lot of solutions and early trials have been described in the
literature, but few of them are very in-depth or are investigated further by other
researchers.
This thesis will show that choosing which positioning solution to use for a given
LBS is difficult. This will be revealed by using a simulated case, in which a com-
plex location based electronic tour guide is to be implemented in a given museum.
To better understand the challenges faced by the positioning system supporting this
LBS, the first chapters will give a general introduction to positioning systems and
technologies. When the case has been introduced, an extensive analysis of existing
positioning solutions against the LBS requirements is performed. Finally, a tool
for choosing positioning system for future LBCSs and a proposal of an improved
LBCS architecture are discussed.


1.1 Problem Statements

The goal of this thesis is threefold: First, it is to give a detailed introduction to
the field of indoor LBCSs and their challenges. Second, it is to provide some
tools that can help others in need for a positioning system to choose among the
many possible solutions that exist. Third, we will look for an architecture proposal
that can be used by future positioning system developers to deal with important
challenges we have identified.
The general problem statement has been the following:

       What kind of positioning system would best fulfil the requirements
       of location based services used in indoor exhibitions?

In order to answer this statement, six specific problem statements have been de-
fined.

    1. How is positioning done?

    2. What technologies exist that may be used for positioning?

    3. What are the requirements and challenges of positioning systems supporting
       LBSs in indoor exhibitions?
1.2. METHOD                                                                         5

   4. Are there any currently available positioning systems that meet these require-
      ments and challenges?

   5. Is it possible to formalise the procedure of selecting positioning system ac-
      cording to given requirements?

   6. Are there any severe limitations of existing LBCSs?

Statement number three above implies that we have to find out what the require-
ments of such LBSs are. We also need to know something about the premises that
houses the exhibition. Thus, we have chosen to use a case to help us with gather-
ing such knowledge. The case used is the Norwegian Astrup Fearnley Museum of
Modern Art. More on the use of this case will be discussed in section 1.2.



1.2 Method

The following methods have been used in this thesis to address the problem state-
ments.


Theory Study An extensive theory study of positioning systems in general, po-
sitioning techniques, wireless technologies, existing positioning systems and loca-
tion based tour guides is carried out. Many technological details are left out, the
goal is to get an overall understanding of the positioning system research field, and
not how the technology is realised.
In the initial phase of the work with this thesis, much emphasis and effort was put
in finding state of the art literature. A recent brief search for the main topics in
the thesis was performed, but revealed little new on the field. It seems like the
field of indoor positioning has been “stabilised”, in that current research is mostly
concerned with improvements of existing solutions.


Case Study As stated in the problem statements section, we will need exten-
sive information about LBS requirements and the exhibition premises where it will
operate, before we can evaluate if existing positioning solutions can sufficiently
support this service. As a means for gathering all this information, we will use a
semi-hypothetical, or semi-simulated, case. As we are not going to implement or
develop a positioning solution, we don’t need a real case where the customer spec-
ifies the requirements. Rather, we use a simulated case, where we can add all the
requirements we want. The main advantage of using a simulated case, is that we
can include as many details as possible, and by this increase the possibility that the
case will provide valuable learning for future use. A real case typically includes
6                                                 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

some specific requirements that are not relevant to others, or have too few details
to be of any interest.
The case we will use is a mobile electronic tour guide in the Norwegian Astrup
Fearnley Museum for Modern Art. The reason for calling the case semi-simulated,
is that we will use real premises and exhibitions, but that the requirements for the
tour guide will be artificial, that is, made by us and not a customer.
To get a better understanding of what is going on in the museum, interview and
observation was used. A person with extensive knowledge about the museum was
interviewed. She had been working as a receptionist and guide at the museum for
several years. To complement the interview, two days were spent in the museum,
with an exhibition change in between. How the exhibits were arranged, what kind
of artefacts there were, the number of artefacts, how visitors behaved and so on
were observed.



Analysis A requirements specification for a tour guide LBS based on the case is
developed, and an analysis of existing positioning solutions against these require-
ments is performed. Also taken into account is the specific premises of the Astrup
Fearnley museum. For each system we assume that it is going to be used for the
LBS in the given museum, and evaluate how well the requirements are fulfilled. To
make it easier to draw some general conclusions from the analysis, tables are used
for representing the results in different ways.



1.3 Contributions

There are three main contributions in this thesis. First, it gives a detailed introduc-
tion to the field of indoor location based computing systems (LBCSs) in general,
with emphasis on the underlying positioning systems. Then it provides an intro-
duction to the domain of indoor exhibitions and mobile electronic tour guide LBSs
used in these.
Second, this thesis provides a proposal of a tool called a decision flow diagram.
This is supposed to help others to choose what kind of positioning system they
should use, based on their LBS requirements and the premises in which it will
operate.
Last, as a consequence of the problems with choosing the right positioning system,
this thesis suggests a new flexible architecture for future LBCSs, based on the ser-
vice oriented architecture (SOA) concept. The goal of this architecture is to make it
easy to substitute one positioning system with another, with changing requirements
from LBSs.

1.4 Related Work

A lot of positioning systems have been proposed, both academic and commercial.
These use a variety of different positioning techniques and technologies. The Ac-
tive badge system [4] from 1992 is among the first positioning systems described.
It provided room scale accuracy for tracking people in an office building. Three
other systems followed, with the aim of solving different challenges of the Active
badge system. Active bat [5] provided a much higher accuracy at centimetre level,
Cricket [6] focuses on solving privacy issues and removing wires from the infras-
tructure, and RADAR [7] tries to utilise already existing WLAN infrastructure for
positioning, removing the need for special infrastructure completely. Since these
systems, the “Classic Four”, there has been a boom of other solutions. Some posi-
tioning solutions have even been made with electronic tour guides and exhibitions
in mind, like in Cyberguide [8], Torre Aquila [9] and TaggedX [10]. The short-
coming of most solutions is that they focus on only a limited set of positioning
requirements, or on a specific LBS.
Taxonomies have been developed to aid developers of location based services to
choose positioning system [11, 12]. This work include a list of different positioning
system properties that should be evaluated. This is very useful for getting a deeper
understanding of a certain positioning system, but is less valuable in cases where
help for choosing which positioning system to use should be decided. This is
because it does not take into account the premises in which the system is to be
installed, or how the building is used. Much emphasis should also be on the specific
domain the positioning system is a part of.
Architectures for LBCSs have been proposed in [13, 14, 15]. However, most of the
existing systems today are proprietary.



1.5 Document Structure

In addition to this introductory chapter, this thesis consists of six more chapters.
Chapter 2 starts with introducing a reference model for discussing Location Based
Computing Systems (LBCSs). It then gives an introduction to the field of position-
ing systems by evaluating their components, designs, properties, and how position-
ing can be done.
An overview of wireless technologies that can be used to implement a positioning
system is provided in chapter 3.
In chapter 4, existing positioning systems are described.
In chapter 5, an introduction to mobile electronic tour guides and positioning tech-
8                                               CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

nology for indoor exhibitions is provided, together with a description of the mu-
seum used in the case study. A requirements specification is developed.
Chapter 6 starts with a detailed analysis of existing positioning solutions accord-
ing to the requirements specification developed in chapter 6. Then follows a dis-
cussion of the analysis results, which leads to our two proposals: a decision flow
diagram that can help choosing positioning system for an LBS, and a SOA based
architecture for future LBCSs.
Chapter 7 provides the conclusion of this thesis. It includes a discussion of how
the thesis has managed to answer the problem statements, a list of contributions,
limitations of the thesis and future work.
Chapter 2

Location Based Computing
Systems

This chapter is an introduction to what we in this thesis will call Location Based
Computing Systems (LBCSs). As the use of the terms position, location, position-
ing systems and location systems can be confusing, we will define these terms and
provide a three-layered reference model which will be used throughout the thesis
as a means for guiding the reader on which level in the LBCS the discussed issues
are handled.
The bottom layer in our reference model is the positioning system. This is where
the actual physical positioning occurs. Various issues on positioning systems will
be described in detail in this chapter, to provide an understanding of the issues that
are to be considered when working with such systems. Issues belonging to layer 2
and layer 3 in our model will be discussed in chapter 4 and chapter 5.



2.1 Introducing a Model for Discussing LBCSs

As mentioned in the introduction to chapter 1, the words position and location are
sometimes used interchangeably. Others refer to “position” as a point in space with
a specified 3D coordinate, and to “location” as a defined place or area with an as-
signed label [16]. Thus, any x,y,z triple in a given reference grid, for example a
position on earth given by latitude, longitude and altitude, is a position. Positions
are often said to be physical, while locations as defined above are said to be sym-
bolic. A system providing physical positions can usually be augmented to provide
corresponding symbolic location information. An example can be to find the near-
est printer given the physical position. In this thesis we will use these distinguished
definitions of position and location:

                                          9
10                  CHAPTER 2. LOCATION BASED COMPUTING SYSTEMS




Figure 2.1: A three-layered model for discussing location based services and the
technologies used to realise them


        Position is a point in space with a specific 2D or 3D coordinate with
        respect to a certain reference grid.

        Location is a defined place or area with an assigned label.

We will also assume a three-layered model for discussing location based services
(LBSs) and the technologies used to realise them (see figure 2.1). There are two
reasons for introducing this model:

     1. It will help clarify how we distinguish a positioning system from a location
        system in this thesis, although they are often used interchangeably by others.

     2. It emphasises the major components of an LBCS, and allows us to focus on
        the interfaces between these.

Together, the three layers in our model constitute what we will call a Location
Based Computing System (LBCS). We will refer to this model and the respective
layers throughout the thesis.
Our model is similar to the Open System Interconnect (OSI) reference model for
computer networks. It is a layered model, where each layer builds on the layer
below. Interfaces between the layers can be used to achieve decoupling between
different parts of a system, as a layer can be substituted by another without having
to alter components at other layers. Similar models are also suggested by others.
The six-layer Location Stack is a set of design abstractions for location systems for
ubiquitous computing [13]. Other models are the four-layer system architectures
suggested in [15, 14].
With respect to LBCSs architectures, this thesis is concerned with achieving flex-
ible introduction of positioning systems, and flexible introduction of LBSs. Our
2.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF POSITIONING SYSTEMS                                          11

model is therefore a simplified version of the ones referred to above, focusing pri-
marily on flexibility between layer 1 and 2 and between layer 3 and 2. The other
models consider also internal organisation of what we refer to as layer 2, but this
is out of scope for this thesis.
By flexibility we mean that different positioning systems could be used in the pro-
visioning of location information to an LBS, and that new positioning systems
could be added without the need for changes in the LBS. For this we need a middle
layer, which takes care of translating positions (i.e. from the positioning layer) to
locations which can be used by the LBSs. Without this middle layer, each LBS
would have to be designed to take advantage of positions from each positioning
system.
The three layers of our model are described below, starting with the lowest layer as
the other two build on this one:

Positioning System In layer 1, we find the positioning systems. This is where the
      actual, physical positioning occurs. Sensor hardware and low level software
      gather raw sensor data, compute positions based on these data, and convert
      them to standardised physical position representations which are accessible
      by layer 2. These representations could be for example x,y,z triples, or MAC
      address pairs of receivers and sensed entities. We will look more at the
      components and processes of the positioning layer in section 2.2. In chapter
      3 we will look at technologies that can be used for positioning.
Location System The location systems in layer 2 are used to provide meaning to
     physical positions provided by layer 1. This could be to give a symbolic label
     to a position, like “close to object A” or “in room B”, or to plot the position
     on a map. The location system also maintains databases that map physical
     positions with symbolic locations and vice versa. This enables services on
     layer 3 to make use of the position information.
Location Based Services (LBSs) In layer 3 we find the location based services
     (LBSs), like those described in the introduction to chapter 1. In chapter 5 we
     will look closer at several such services, which together constitute a mobile
     electronic tour guide.


2.2 Fundamentals of Positioning Systems

We will now look closer at the positioning systems in layer 1 in our proposed three-
layered model. First, we will look at the components of such systems, and then we
will describe two different positioning system designs. Then follows an overview
of positioning system properties, we introduce the concept “sensor fusion”, and
finally we will look at how positioning can actually be done.
12                CHAPTER 2. LOCATION BASED COMPUTING SYSTEMS




                 Figure 2.2: Components of a positioning system




2.2.1 Positioning System Components


A positioning system consists of the objects that we want to determine the position
of, the objects of interest, and some infrastructure. An object of interest (OOI)
could be an object that can move itself, like a human being, an animal, or a robot.
It could also be a dead artefact, for example a projector in an office building, or a
heart defibrillator in a hospital.
The infrastructure typically consists of transmitters, receivers, computing entities
and network(s). These will be described in the following sections.
It is important to note that what we want to know the position of is the OOI, but
what we actually position is a mobile device or a tag carried by or attached to
the OOI [17]. The mobile device could be for example a hand-held computer or a
mobile phone. The tag is typically a simpler and smaller device that can be attached
to an OOI for the only purpose of positioning (see figure 2.2).
The mobile device or tag is normally only logically connected to the OOI. This
means that when we know the position of the mobile device or tag, we can look
up the corresponding OOI in a database and assume it is in the same position.
However, it could be that for example two children wearing tags switch these, or
throw them away, and thus fool the positioning system.

                Figure 2.3: Remote-positioning vs self-positioning


2.2.2 Positioning System Designs

The objects of interest (OOIs) are associated with either the positioning infrastruc-
ture transmitters or the receivers, and this gives two different system designs [11,
12]. These are described in figure 2.3. In remote-positioning, a. to the left in
the figure, the OOIs are associated with the transmitters, and receivers are placed
in the surrounding environment. The transmitters emit signals that are detected
by the receivers and sent to a central computing entity for processing and position
determination. In a self-positioning scheme, b. to the right in the figure, the OOIs
are associated with the receivers which detect signals emitted from surrounding
transmitters. The computing is done by a device carried by or attached to the OOI,
which the receiver is connected to or integrated in. How the positioning is done
will be described in section 2.2.4 on page 17.
By using remote-positioning, the burden of the computing is laid on the infrastruc-
ture. This means that the transmitter device or tag associated with the OOI could
be relatively simple, and thus typically use less power, have smaller form factor
and be less expensive than a device or tag in a self-positioning scheme.
On the other hand, using self-positioning could help ensure privacy. In systems
where human beings are being tracked, by positioning of a tag attached to the
person or a mobile device known to be used by a certain person, privacy is an
important issue. A location based computing system should not violate any privacy
rights, and for a location based service to be accepted and adopted by its users
it also needs to be trusted. Gathered information should not be used for other
purposes than agreed upon in advance, and the user should be able to turn the
tracking feature off at any time.
14                  CHAPTER 2. LOCATION BASED COMPUTING SYSTEMS

2.2.3 Positioning System Properties

This section will review the properties of a positioning system [11, 17]. These are
necessary to understand, as a positioning system requirements specification for a
location based service typically is based on them, as we will see in chapter 5, and
as they are used to compare different positioning systems.


Accuracy and Related Properties

Accuracy is the most obvious property to consider when evaluating and comparing
different positioning systems. Accuracy is a measure of the closeness of one or
more positions to a position that is known and defined in terms of an absolute
reference system [18]. “Absolute” means that it uses a shared reference grid for
all the OOIs, so that two objects at precisely the same place will report equivalent
positions. The known position is often referred to as the “true position”. Accuracy
is given in kilometres, metres, centimetres etc.
Precision, on the other hand, is a measure given in percent, and is based on a
relative reference system that is unique to the device making the measurements.
For example, if the OOI is a lost valuable asset with an attached transmitter, each
receiver device that is searching for it reports the object’s position relative to itself.
Precision is a measure of repeatability, and it tells us how often we can expect to get
a given accuracy. For example, if 95% of a system’s position readings are within
10 cm of the true position, it would be said to have an accuracy of 10 cm 95% of
the time, or 10 cm at 95% confidence.
The accuracy of position information needed vary from application to application.
For example, finding a nearby printer requires less accuracy than finding a book in
a large library [19]. In general, the accuracy and precision required dictate the cost
and complexity of the positioning system. Positioning systems that provide high
accuracy tend to require a lot of specialised infrastructure or expensive mobile
devices.
Closely related to the accuracy of a positioning system is the update rate or po-
sition rate—how often the position of an OOI is computed. High update rate is
crucial for systems which goal is to trace users or objects in real-time. Other sys-
tems can manage with lower update rates, but all systems should have an update
rate which matches the accuracy to capture as many changes as possible.
Another property that is related to accuracy is adaptive fidelity. A positioning
system with adaptive fidelity can “adjust its precision in response to dynamic sit-
uations such as partial failures or directives to conserve battery power” [11]. For
example, if a mobile device in a self-positioning system needs to detect signals
from four different transmitters to compute its accurate position and it only receives
2.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF POSITIONING SYSTEMS                                            15




           Figure 2.4: Different transmitter coverages and configurations


signals from two transmitters, it cannot compute its accurate position. However,
it could still know something about its position by knowing which transmitters it
receives signals from and where these are placed. Or, to conserve battery power,
mobile devices in a remote-positioning system could decrease their signalling rate
when they are not moving.
Research has shown that as long as users are informed about the status of the po-
sition accuracy, precision and update rate, periods with lower performance are ac-
cepted. When the user is informed he can adjust his expectations [20, 21]. Like-
wise, it is clever to represent the estimated inaccuracy of positions to users, to
reduce confusion if for example a position showed on a map does not match the
real world [22].



Scale and Scalability

The scale of a positioning system is another important property. Objects can be
located worldwide, within a metropolitan area, throughout a building, or within a
single room. A measurement unit that can be used to describe scale is the coverage
area per unit of infrastructure. From figure 2.4 we can see some different coverage
configurations. The crosses are transmitters with a coverage area given by the
       r     a
radius . In ) we can see that there is one transmitter, which does not have good
enough reach to cover the whole room. OOIs in the corners would not be detected.
  b
In ) there are four transmitters, but these have even smaller coverage so there are
still areas that are not covered (outside the circles). In ) there are two transmitters
with longer reach, and we can see that the areas without coverage is smaller, and
that there is one area that is covered by both transmitters (shaded).
In addition to physical reach, scale includes the system’s ability to position several
objects simultaneously. In an office covering several floors in a large building, hun-
dreds of personnel and maybe thousands of items of equipment might be tracked.
A measurement of this ability is the number of objects the system is able to position
per unit of infrastructure per time interval.
16                 CHAPTER 2. LOCATION BASED COMPUTING SYSTEMS

Scalability denotes how easily a system scales, that is how easy it is to expand the
system either by physical coverage or by adding more and more OOIs. Typically, a
system is expanded by adding more infrastructure, which can be very cumbersome
and expensive.


Easy Deployment, Integration and Configuration

A positioning system’s infrastructure should be easy to deploy, to integrate into
the existing environment and to configure. Deployment is made easy by small
amounts of transmitters/receivers and none or little specialised cabling. As we
will see in the next chapter, some positioning systems can actually take advantage
of existing computer networks as a means of determining positions, thus saving
a lot of work during implementation. In a system using tags attached to OOIs,
these should be small, lightweight, and wireless so that motion of the objects is not
hindered and that they do not disturb the wearer. Transmitters/receivers placed in
the environment and power cords and network cables should be unobtrusive. When
the infrastructure is in place, the configuration of the system should require as little
manual work as possible.


Power Consumption

As we saw above, little specialised cabling makes deployment easier. Thus, several
positioning systems have wireless transmitters and/or receivers in their infrastruc-
ture [23, 20]. However, wireless devices need a power source, typically a battery
although alternative sources such as solar panels can also be used. In a large system
there will be a great number of transmitters and/or receivers distributed over a large
area, and maintaining batteries on all these could be a cumbersome task [4, 24].
Thus, a wired infrastructure network has the advantage of easier power feeding
than a wireless infrastructure.
To minimise the task of replacing or recharging batteries on wireless infrastructure
transmitters, the signal rate is a very important design issue [4]. As we saw in the
discussion of accuracy and update rate (see 2.2.3 on page 14), higher signal rate
may lead to better accuracy. On the other hand, with lower signal rate the batteries
will last much longer, reducing the task of maintaining them. One solution to this
problem could be to use an adaptive signalling rate (see also adaptive fidelity in
section 2.2.3 on the page before). For example, in a system called Active Badge
(see section 4.1.1 on page 42), the signalling units in the badges (tags) worn by
personnel have a light-dependent component that make them increase the time in-
terval between emitted signals to save power when the badge is left in a dark room
or a drawer. Another issue which affects power consumption is the signal strength.
More strength gives longer range and better coverage, but requires more power.

     Figure 2.5: The different stages in the life cycle of a positioning system


Costs

Figure 2.5 shows the different stages in the life cycle of a positioning system:
purchase, deployment, configuration, monitoring, maintaining, and reconfigura-
tion/extension. It is important to remember that costs is not only related to initial
hardware and software investments, but to all the other stages as well. The more
staff required in the different stages, the more expensive the positioning system
will be.
According to [11] the costs of a positioning system can be assessed in several ways,
not only by the most common use of the term which is capital costs. Other types of
costs can be time costs, space costs and incremental costs. In some cases, limited
time or space available might be the main constraints when choosing a positioning
system, not capital costs.


Limitations

All positioning systems have some limitations, which are very important to be
aware of. Some systems will not function in certain environments, for example
indoors, and some systems need line of sight, that is, no obstructions, between
the mobile device and the transmitters/receivers for communication to occur. In
general, we assess functional limitations by considering the characteristics of the
underlying technologies that implement the positioning system. We will study
these technologies in chapter 3.



2.2.4 Position Sensing Techniques

To be able to understand positioning systems, we need to know how positioning
can be done. A great number of different positioning systems exist, but the vast
majority of them are built on one of four basic techniques that can be used indi-
vidually or in combination to determine the position of an object. This section will
give an overview of these general techniques.
18                CHAPTER 2. LOCATION BASED COMPUTING SYSTEMS

Dead Reckoning

Dead reckoning is a positioning technique that is based on the concept of direction
and distance from a known starting point [25]. It was used by navigators in the
days of Columbus, and is used today for example by some Garmin GPS-receivers
when they temporarily lose contact with the satellites. Such a receiver will just
continue to use its current heading and speed to project position [26].
When dead reckoning is used in several steps, each starting point depends on the
previous estimates made. This leads to increased possibility of positioning er-
rors. The strength of dead reckoning is that a large infrastructure is not required
to locate an object, but this also means that it relies on specialised equipment for
self-positioning.


Trilateration and Triangulation

Trilateration and triangulation are positioning techniques that use the geometric
properties of triangles to compute an object’s position [27]. They differ in that
trilateration uses distance measurements in the computation, while triangulation
uses both distances and angles. The term “triangulation” is often used about either
technique, but in this thesis we will use the two different terms to clarify which
technique is used.


Trilateration Trilateration computes the position of an object by measuring its
distance from reference points placed in known positions. When we know the
distance between an object and a reference point, we know that the object’s position
is somewhere on a circle with the reference point as centre and the distance as
radius. If we also know the object’s distance to a second reference point, we get
another circle. The two circles intersect at two points, and one of these points is
the position of the object. By measuring the distance to a third reference point, we
get three circles which will intersect in only one point. This is the position of the
object. Figure 2.6 on the facing page shows a position, the black dot, computed by
measuring the distance to the three reference points A, B, and C.
What we have just described assumes that the object and the reference points are in
the same plane. In three-dimensional space we have spheres instead of circles, and
distance measurements to at least four reference points are required. The object’s
position will now be given by the intersection of the four spheres.
Domain-specific knowledge may reduce the number of required distance measure-
ments needed in trilateration. When facing geometric ambiguity, one of the possi-
ble positions can often be eliminated by introducing some domain-specific rules.
For example, if a positioning system based on trilateration is used at only one floor
2.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF POSITIONING SYSTEMS                                           19




                                Figure 2.6: Trilateration in 2D.


in a building, three reference points can be enough for three-dimensional position.
This is because one of the two possible positions given by three intersecting spheres
will be on another floor of the building. This position could easily be eliminated,
and the fourth distance measurement is not required.
There are two main approaches to measuring the distances required by the trilater-
ation technique. These are by time of flight, or by attenuation.


Time of Flight Measuring distance using time of flight (TOF) means to measure
     the time it takes to travel between two points of interest at a known velocity1 .
     One of the points may be an object moving away from the other at a known
     velocity for a given time interval, but the more typical case is where both
     points are approximately stationary and we observe the difference in trans-
     mission time and arrival time of an emitted signal. To be able to determine
     time of flight between a transmitter and a receiver, agreement about time is
     necessary. This means that they have to be synchronised.

Attenuation The intensity of an emitted signal decreases with distance from the
     transmitter. The decrease relative to the original intensity is the attenuation.
     If we know the original strength of the signal, and a function correlating
     attenuation and distance for this type of signal is known, we can estimate the
     distance between a transmitter and a receiver. The degradation of the signal
     is highly dependent on the surrounding environment, and empirical models
     for path loss have been made for many typical situations, like for different
     signals penetrating walls of different materials.

                          Figure 2.7: Triangulation in 2D.


A quantity called the Position Dilution Of Precision (PDOP) is used to describe
the relative reduction in the certainty of a computed position based on trilateration.
PDOP depends solely on the relative geometry of the OOI and the transmitters or
receivers of the infrastructure, and thus provides a means for determining whether
that geometry will result in a well-defined or more uncertain position measurement.
A low value of PDOP indicates a good relative geometry, and is achieved when the
transmitters or receivers are spread out in the environment [17].


Triangulation Triangulation uses angle measurements in addition to distance
measurements to determine the position of an object. An example is given in fig-
ure 2.7. Two reference points (A and B) are required, and the angles between the
object to be positioned and a zero degree reference vector is measured. In the figure
this vector is the same as the line drawn between A and B. By knowing one length
measurement, for example between the reference points, the law of sines can be
used to compute the position. Two-dimensional triangulation requires two angle
measurements and one length measurement. With three dimensions, an additional
azimuth measurement is needed.


Proximity Sensing

A proximity based positioning technique determines when an object is “near”, or
in proximity to, a known position. The object’s presence is sensed using a physical
phenomenon with limited and known range. This could be by detecting physical
contact, or by detecting wireless signals. Examples of the first could be pressure
and touch sensors like floor sensors or touch screens.
When detecting wireless signals, the accuracy of the position depends on the range
2.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF POSITIONING SYSTEMS                                            21




      Figure 2.8: Larger vs smaller cells and coverage in a proximity system


of the device in the known position. If the range, and thus the coverage areas, of
the devices in known positions are small, a large amount of devices are needed
to provide coverage of the entire environment. This could be expensive and time-
consuming to deploy and maintain. However, many devices with short range in
known positions provide better accuracy than fewer devices with longer range (see
figure 2.8). The coverage area of an infrastructure transmitter is often called a cell.



Scene Analysis

Visual scene analysis is a positioning technique which uses features of a scene
observed from a particular point of view to draw conclusions about the position
of the observer or of objects in the scene [27]. For example, observations made
by a head-mounted camera can be matched to features recorded in a database with
corresponding positions.
Signal strength profiling, also called fingerprinting, is another form of scene anal-
ysis. Signal strength from all transmitters in range are measured and recorded in
certain positions throughout the area in which positioning is to take place. All
these measurements are stored in a database, together with the associated known
position. The position of a mobile device can then be determined by measuring sig-
nal strengths from the transmitters in range, and comparing these data with signal
strengths in the database.
The advantage of scene analysis is that the location of objects can be inferred using
passive observation and features that do not correspond to geometric angles or
distances. As we will see in the next chapter, use of wireless technology could
make distance and angle measurements a challenging task. The disadvantage with
scene analysis is that it is based on making empirical models, which require a
large amount of manual work. In addition, changes in the environment can require
reconstruction of, or a completely new, data set. In fact, many environments change
so often that several datasets should be made in advance. For example, a data set
22                CHAPTER 2. LOCATION BASED COMPUTING SYSTEMS

representing a large office may vary greatly with the time of day or day of week.
On weekends there are much less people in the area, and during weekdays there are
much more people coming and going at 9 am and 4 pm than during work hours.
By using different datasets representing different situations, better positioning is
possible.


2.3 Sensor Fusion

Sensor fusion is the use of information provided by several different sensor systems
in parallell. An example of extensive use of sensor fusion is the robot industry,
especially when researchers try to build robots that behave like human beings. Such
robots are equipped with different specialised sensors for simulating sight, hearing,
smell, touch, navigation, and so on. By using a combination of sensor technologies
with different capabilities, the quality of information provided by the system can
be increased. In the domain of positioning systems, sensor fusion can for example
provide better accuracy.
The challenge with sensor fusion is that it requires a more complex infrastructure,
is more difficult to manage, and may supply an application with contradictory posi-
tion information which needs to be managed in a proper way to be useful. It would
be advantageous to hide details of the positioning from the applications, so that
different technologies can be used at the same time without the application need
to now how to handle the different technologies, and to minimise the effects of
changes [11, 17]. This means that sensor fusion is the responsibility of the location
system in layer 2 of our reference model, not the positioning layer which we have
described in this chapter.


2.4 Summary

In this chapter we have introduced a three-layered reference model for discussing
location based computing systems (LBCSs) and the technologies used to imple-
ment them. Then we discussed components, designs, properties, and techniques
for positioning systems at layer 1 in more detail. In the next chapter we will dis-
cuss challenges with wireless technology and look at the different technologies that
can be used to implement indoor positioning systems. An understanding of the un-
derlying technologies will help to understand the possibilities and limitations of
actual positioning systems.
Chapter 3

Indoor Positioning Technologies

In chapter 1 we saw that the satellite based Global Positioning System (GPS) does
not work well within buildings or in other areas where there are no line of sight to
at least four GPS satellites. Even if we could use the GPS system as it is indoors,
the accuracy of about 15 metres would not be sufficient in many applications. This
is also true for mobile cellular technology (which works indoors)—the accuracy is
too low for many indoor applications. Thus, researchers are seeking other ways to
determine positions in indoor environments, based on wireless technology.
There are three major groups of wireless technologies commonly used for indoor
positioning, depending on which type of communications medium they are based
upon. The first group is positioning technologies that are based on infrared light.
The second group consists of all the different technologies that are based on radio
transmissions. The third group is based on ultrasound. After a brief introduction
to wireless technology in general, this chapter will review wireless technologies to
see how they can be used for positioning. Understanding the underlying technolo-
gies is important because it explains the physical possibilities and limitations of a
positioning system. With regards to our three-layered reference model, we are still
at layer 1 as showed in figure 3.1 on the next page.




3.1 General Properties of Wireless Technology

To understand wireless technology, we need to know something about waves.
These are the carriers of information between transmitters and receivers in a wire-
less system. By encoding information onto waves, they can be used for wireless
communication as in radio and mobile phones.

                                         23
24                   CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES




Figure 3.1: This chapter will review wireless technologies that can be used for
indoor positioning. This is a part of the positioning layer.




                            Figure 3.2: Wave properties


3.1.1 Waves

A wave can be described by its energy, wavelength, and frequency (see figure 3.2).
Energy is shown by the amplitude. Wavelength is the distance between one wave
crest to the next, and the frequency denotes how many wave crests that passes a
given point in a second. The measurement unit for frequency is called Hertz (Hz).
Depending on these properties, which are mathematically related, waves behave
very differently. For example, a wave with long wavelength and thus low frequency
needs less energy to travel, and is able to penetrate more materials than a wave with
high frequency.
The waves that are most commonly used for communication are electromagnetic
waves and soundwaves. Electromagnetic waves are related to electrical and mag-
netic fields, and what distinguish them from other waves is that they can travel
without a medium, through a vacuum as in empty space.
3.1. GENERAL PROPERTIES OF WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY                                   25

The most commonly used electromagnetic waves for communication are radio
waves and infrared light waves. The radio waves have wave lengths from longer
than a football field to shorter than a football, and are used to carry signals for
radio, television, mobile phones etc. Infrared light waves are divided in the longer
far infrared wavelengths with size of a pin head, to the shorter near infrared with
size like cells in our body—microscopic. The first group is actually thermal heat
like the red we can see from a fire, while the near infrared cannot be felt and is
what is being used for example in TV remote controls.
Sound waves differ from electromagnetic waves in that they are mechanical waves,
which means that they need a medium to travel through, such as air, water, metal
etc. Sound is a compression waveform, and is created by the vibration of some
object, and detected when the sound wave causes a sensor to vibrate. However,
sound has the standard characteristics of any waveform. The amplitude of a sound
wave is the same as its loudness, and the frequency is how high or low the sound is.
The speed of sound in air is approximately 344 metres/second at room temperature.
The human ear is capable of detecting sound waves of frequencies between ap-
proximately 20 Hz to 20 000 Hz. Sound with a frequency below 20 Hz is known
as infrasound, and sound with frequency above 20 000 Hz is known as ultrasound.
As we will see later in this thesis, ultrasound is used by many positioning systems.


3.1.2 Propagation Mechanisms

Wireless communication is more difficult than wired communications because there
are so many obstacles and changes that affect the signals on their way from the
transmitter to the receiver. The four basic wireless propagation mechanisms are
described below:

Reflection Reflection occurs when a wave hits an object that is large compared to
      the wave’s wavelength, and results in the wave bouncing off the surface of
      the object.
Refraction Refraction is the change in direction of a wave due to a change in its
     speed. This is most commonly seen when a wave passes from one medium
     to another.
Diffraction Diffraction occurs when waves are obstructed by a surface with sharp
      edges. The waves will bend around such obstacles, like the corner of a wall.
Scattering Scattering occurs when a wave hits objects that are small compared to
      the wave’s wavelength.

This means that how a wave will behave when hitting an obstacle depends on its
properties (energy, wavelength and frequency) compared to the obstacle’s proper-
26                    CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES




          Figure 3.3: Examples of reflection, refraction, and diffraction


ties (size and material). It should be noted that in some cases we depend on these
mechanisms, they are not only negative. For example, diffraction could help us
reach areas which without it would have been dead-spots.
The effects of the propagation mechanisms are as follows:


Multipath Different signal components may travel by different paths from a trans-
     mitter to the receiver. The components experience different delays, hence
     they won’t reach the receiver at the same time. This results in a distorted ver-
     sion of the transmitted signal at the receiver. This is a challenge for example
     when using time of flight, which we discussed in section 2.2.4 on page 19.
     Pulses traveling indirect and hence longer paths should be ignored, but this
     is made difficult by the fact that the direct and indirect pulses look identical.
     This has to be dealt with, and one solution is to statistically prune away re-
     flected measurements by aggregating multiple receivers’ measurements and
     observing the environment’s reflective properties.
      Multipath within buildings is strongly influenced by the layout of the build-
      ing, the construction material used, and the number and type of objects in
      the building.

Shadowing Signals blocked by obstructing structures.

Attenuation The strength of waves decrease with distance between transmitter
     and receiver. The transmitter’s power and the receiver’s sensitivity determine
     the distance over which they can communicate. In section 2.2.4 on page 19,
     we saw that attenuation can be used to determine distance. However, in en-
     vironments with many obstructions, measuring distance using attenuation is
     usually less accurate than by time of flight, due to the signal propagation
     mechanisms described above. These effects cause the attenuation to corre-
     late poorly with distance.
3.2. INFRARED (IR)                                                                27

In other words, the typical problems faced are signals that are too weak to be de-
tected by the receiver, dead-spots, noise and interference. We will look at frequency
regulations to minimise interference problems in the next section.


3.1.3 Frequency Regulations

The transmitters and receivers involved in wireless communication are tuned to
operate in a given frequency range. The frequency spectrum used by wireless
technology is highly regulated, and can be seen as a hindrance for the wireless
industry. But, at the same time regulation is necessary for coping with interference
problems.
Until 1985, vendors had to apply for frequency licenses to operate their wireless
products. Then, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the United
States authorised the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency bands at
2.4GHz for unlicensed spread spectrum and wideband communications use. This
accelerated the development in the wireless industry [28].



3.2 Infrared (IR)

Infrared wireless communication makes use of the invisible spectrum of light just
below red in the visible spectrum. This means that IR communication is blocked
by obstacles that block light—almost everything solid. Infrared can be used in
communication outdoors with Gbit/s data rates, for example to connect local area
networks in different buildings. But, in such cases laser is used as the optical
source, and this is not suitable for most indoor use because of the potential safety
hazard and high cost. The optical source normally used indoors is light emitting
diodes (LEDs), similar to those used in the remote controls of consumer electron-
ics. Thus, IR modules can be small, low cost and consume little power. Since IR
signals cannot penetrate through walls, it is suitable for sensitive communication
because it won’t be accessible outside the room or building. There are no restric-
tions for using the infrared frequencies.
IR is used in two different ways, direct IR and diffuse IR. As an example of direct
IR we give an overview of the IrDA standard. Then follows an overview of diffuse
IR.


3.2.1 IrDA

One method for infrared communication has been specified by the Infrared Data
Association (IrDA) [29]. This method has become a recognised standard com-
28                    CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES

monly called just IrDA, and is the one used by most mobile phones and notebook
and hand-held computers. IrDA is a point-to-point ad-hoc data transmission stan-
dard designed for very low-power communications. It uses direct IR, which means
that line of sight is required—the communicating devices must "see" each other.
IrDA operates over a distance of 0 to 1 metre at speeds of up to 16 Mbps, soon to
leapfrog from 100 to 500 Mbps. With its narrow 30 degree angle cone IrDA is best
suited for point-and-shoot style applications, since it is usually required that the
devices engaged in communication are aligned with (pointed at) each other. This
implies that IrDA communication is between two devices at a time only, since a
single access point cannot be shared by several users.



3.2.2 Diffuse IR

When using diffuse IR, the transmitted IR signals are stronger than those used for
direct IR, and thus they have longer reach (9–12 metres) [30]. In addition, wide
angle LEDs are used, which emit signals in many directions. Because the signals
are easily blocked and reflected, they will bounce around the room. This means
that diffuse infrared allows many-to-many connections, does not require direct line
of sight, and can be uni-directional or bi-directional. Since infrared light doesn’t
travel through walls, diffuse IR is suitable for connecting devices which are in the
same room. The effective range of diffuse IR limits cell sizes to small- or medium-
sized rooms, so that in larger rooms, multiple infrared sensors must be used [11].
It should be noticed that although diffuse IR works without line of sight, the data
rate decreases severely in such cases.
One problem with diffuse infrared systems is that they have difficulty in locations
with fluorescent lighting or direct sunlight because the infrared emissions these
light sources generate may interfere with the signals [11]. Another problem is that
diffuse infrared links often create delays, since it takes time for the signals to travel
to the wall or other objects that causes reflection and get back to the destination.



3.2.3 IR-based Positioning Systems

IR-based positioning systems tend to use proximity detection by monitoring wire-
less cellular access points. Positioning systems based on direct IR typically rely on
a human user taking explicit actions for positioning to occur, due to the short range
and the requirements for line of sight and device alignment. When using diffuse
IR, the user can remain passive because the IR signals that bounce around the room
will find any present IR receivers on their own. This also means that diffuse IR can
be used where there are no human user, for example in a system which locates
equipment tagged with IR receivers.
3.3. RADIO FREQUENCY (RF)                                                         29

3.3 Radio Frequency (RF)

A very important characteristic of radio waves is their ability to penetrate solid,
non-metal objects. This implies that there is no line of sight requirement between
RF transmitters and receivers. It also implies that RF communication is not inher-
ently secure, and that it is subject to uncontrolled interference. Special care must
be taken to avoid this and to protect sensitive communication. Last, RF transmit-
ters and receivers typically consume more power than IR devices, and most part of
the radio frequency spectrum is strictly regulated, so FCC certification is required.



3.3.1 The 802.11 WLAN Family

The IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) standard was ratified in
June 1997 [28]. The standard defines the protocol and compatible interconnection
of data communication equipment via the air in a local area network (LAN) using
the carrier sense multiple access protocol with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
medium sharing mechanism.
Two configurations are specified in the 802.11 standard: ad-hoc and infrastructure.
The ad-hoc mode enables mobile devices to communicate directly without the use
of an access point, like a peer-to-peer network. All stations are usually independent
and equivalent, and no infrastructure is needed. Such a network is closed, with no
access to the Internet. In the more commonly used infrastructure mode, access
points bridge mobile stations and the wired network. The radio range and the
surrounding environment of an access point determines the coverage area, or cell
size, for that access point. By placing the access points so that their coverage
areas overlap, the mobile stations can seamlessly move between the access points
without losing network contact. This is called roaming. A handoff occurs when
the mobile station goes from one access point to the next. A protocol1 has been
specified which standardises this handoff information, so that access points from
different vendors can communicate with each other. A single access point can
support a small group of users.
The 802.11 standard can use either infrared or radio as physical medium. The
type of infrared transmission used is diffuse infrared, with a typical range of 10
metres. This, and the fact that the communication quality is sensitive to the en-
vironment (e.g. the number of reflected surfaces and line of sight paths), limits
the use of infrared and is the reason why vendors usually adopt radio as commu-
nication medium. The standard specifies two different radio frequency physical
layers, both primarily operating at the 2.4 GHz ISM band: Direct Sequence Spread
Spectrum (DSSS) and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS).

30                   CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES

IEEE 802.11b

In September 1999, the IEEE 802.11 standard from 1997 was officially revised [28].
The new standard was called 802.11b, or 802.11 High Rate. It still operates on the
2.4 GHz frequency band, but provides a data rate up to 11 Mbps with fallback rates
of 5, 2, and 1 Mbps. This standard also promises interoperability among products
of different vendors, and the 802.11b networks have successfully conquered the
WLAN market and are widely used in homes, cafes, airports, hotels, and at univer-
sity campuses. But with such widespread use, interference problems within the 2.4
GHz ISM band become a major issue. Bluetooth devices (to be discussed in sec-
tion 3.3.2 on the next page) and a lot of medical and household equipment also use
this frequency band, e.g. cordless phones and microwave ovens. This interference
issue and the wish for even faster speed led to the specification of an additional
standard, the 802.11a described in the next section.
Performance measurements indicate that the 802.11b data rate slows down sub-
stantially the greater the distance between the access point and the mobile station.
The maximum data rate of 11 Mbps is typically achievable up to 100+ feet. Be-
tween 100+ feet and 175+ feet the data rate is typically 5.5 Mbps, and from 175+
up to 225 feet the data rate is 2 Mbps. The 802.11a and g in the following sections
are also subject to a such decrease in data rates with distance. In general, the data
rates of all three standards are considered to be 50-100 metres.


IEEE 802.11a

The IEEE 802.11a standard was approved in September 1999 as a solution to the
intereference problems in the ISM band [28]. This standard uses the 5 GHz fre-
quency band, which means that it is not compatible with 802.11b. It uses Orthogo-
nal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which provides data rates up to 54
Mbps and beyond. Required speeds are 6, 12 and 24 Mbps with optional speeds up
to 54 Mbps. But this high data rate is only achieved with a range less than 25 feet.
The data rate then gradually decline with distance. The drawback with this stan-
dard, in addition to the incompatibility with 802.11b, is that the 5 GHz spectrum
is not license-free in all countries. This led to yet another standard, the 802.11g
described in the next section.


IEEE 802.11g

The 802.11g standard was ratified in June 2003 to enhance the 802.11b technol-
ogy. Two optional modulations were specified, Packet Binary Convolution Code
(PBCC) which supports 22 Mbps and 33 Mbps for payload data rate, and OFDM
which supports at most 54 Mbps. These are both compatible with 802.11b.
3.3. RADIO FREQUENCY (RF)                                                          31

WLAN as Positioning Technology

As with IrDA, the different WLAN standards were not designed to determine po-
sition of mobile devices. But still, these wireless network technologies can offer
sufficient position determination to be useful in many location based services. The
big advantage of using WLAN to determine positions of mobile devices in the net-
work is that the infrastructure is often already in place, since wireless networks has
become so common. In addition, the cost of the access point can’t be beat; it seems
like vendors are practically giving away Wi-Fi access points. On the other hand, as
with any wireless LAN application, potential performance degradation should be
taken into account. A location based computing system invokes the transmission
of overhead packets over the wireless LAN in order to implement positioning al-
gorithms. This additional overhead may significantly lessen throughput available
to users. Thus, a solution that minimises the transmission of packets should be
sought. Also, because of the large physical range, Wi-Fi technology consumes a
lot of power, limiting its use in many small battery-powered mobile devices.
WLAN access points could be used for proximity sensing, but because of the wide
range of WLAN access points the accuracy would be coarse-grained and not very
useful for indoor location based applications. Thus, as we will see in chapter 5,
most WLAN based positioning systems are based on scene analysis and signal
strength profiling, or trilateration using attenuation to determine distances.


3.3.2 The 802.15 WPAN Family

IEEE 802.15 is the IEEE working group for Wireless Personal Area Networks
(WPANs). This group is developing standards for short-range personal wireless
networks consisting of devices such as PCs, hand-held and pocket computers, mo-
bile phones, next-generation pagers, digital cameras, video cameras, and other de-
vices.


Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1)

The IEEE 802.15.1 standard, based on Bluetooth v1.1, is a short-range wireless
voice and data communications protocol which employs RF technology [31]. The
Bluetooth project was begun by Ericsson in 1994, and the Bluetooth Special Inter-
est Group (SIG) formed in May 1998 to develop an open specification for globally
available short-range wireless RF communications.
Bluetooth operates in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz spectrum, and must cope with in-
terference from IEEE 802.11 (see 3.3.1 on page 29), baby monitors, garage door
openers, cordless phones, microwave ovens and other RF communications tech-
nologies which also use this frequency.
32                   CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES

The Bluetooth network model is one of peer-to-peer communications based upon
proximity networking (see 2.2.4 on page 20). When two Bluetooth enabled de-
vices come within range of each other, they can establish a Bluetooth link, where
one device acts as master and the other as slave. Any Bluetooth equipped device
can assume either role. The connection establishment process can take up to 10
seconds, but it can often be accomplished in less than 5.
A master may communicate with up to 7 “active” slaves and up to 255 “parked”slaves.
These devices are said to form a piconet. The use of parked mode, that the slaves
maintain synchronisation but do not listen for transmissions from the master, al-
lows the master to communicate with the whole piconet by exchanging active and
parked slaves to maintain up to seven active connections. In parked mode slaves
are less responsive, but it permit greater power conservation. The master-slave rela-
tionship is important for low-level communications, but in general devices operate
as peers to each other.
When two or more piconets partially overlap in time and space, a scatternet is
formed. This topology provides a flexible method by which devices can maintain
multiple connections. This is especially useful for mobile devices which frequently
move into and out of proximity to other devices.
Bluetooth is designed to be a very low power technology, with estimated nominal
power at 100 mW although this is product dependent. Nominal link range for the
standard 0 dBm Bluetooth radio is approximately from 10 cm to 10 metres, omni-
directional, but power amplified 20 dBm radios with range of about 100 metres are
also possible. The 1.0 specification focuses on 10 metre range. The Bluetooth data
rate is currently 1 Mbps.


Bluetooth as Positioning Technology The Bluetooth SIG has several working
groups that focus on specific parts of the technology or on supporting services.
One of these groups are the Local Positioning group, which investigates the use of
Bluetooth wireless technology for positioning.
Like mentioned in the previous section, Bluetooth is based upon proximity net-
working. Bluetooth devices form mini-cells, and when enough such cells are in-
stalled, the position of a transmitter can be given by knowing which cell it is com-
municating with. However, as we will see in the next chapter, Bluetooth can also
be used in trilateration and scene analysis systems.
Bluetooth has with its omni-directional characteristic problems discovering the in-
tended recipient. A Bluetooth device must perform a timeconsuming discovery
operation that will find many of the other devices in the room. Close proximity
to the intended recipient will not help. The user will be forced to choose from a
list of discovered devices. Choosing the proper device will often require special
information from the other person (e.g. 48-bit device address or friendly name).
3.3. RADIO FREQUENCY (RF)                                                          33

The advantages of Bluetooth are that in addition to positioning information it
also provides some limited data communications, about 700 kbps (vs. 11Mbps
in 802.11), and that two devices communicating don’t need to be aligned, they
don’t even have to be visible to each other so they can be in different rooms.
The biggest disadvantage of Bluetooth technology is that it requires a lot of rela-
tively expensive receiving cells. The greater the number of cells, the smaller the
size of each cell and hence greater accuracy, but more cells increase the cost of pur-
chase and installation. Another consideration is the need to have a host computer
to support the Bluetooth radio to be located, so it is currently impractical to locate
objects that don’t have a built-in computer.
It is expected that Bluetooth hardware is likely to remain more expensive than IrDA
hardware owing to the complexity of the underlying technology, although the cost
difference probably will narrow over time. Current prices for an IrDA module
versus a Bluetooth module is about 2 and 5 USD.
Because of the 2.4 GHz spectrum which Bluetooth is using being unlicensed, new
uses for it are to be expected, and as the spectrum becomes more widely used, radio
interference is more likely to occur.



IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee

The IEEE 802.15.4 specification defines the physical and MAC layers of a low-
complexity, low-cost, low-data rate solution which makes multi-month to multi-
year battery life possible. It is operating in three unlicensed frequency bands, 2.4
GHz and 915 MHz for North America, and 868 MHz for Europe. The achieved
data rates for the different frequencies are 250 kbps (up to 30 metres), 40 kbps, and
20 kbps. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard was first released in 2003, and updated in
2006 [32, 33].
The ZigBee standard provides network, security, and application support services
operating on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 specification. It is capable of autonomously
connecting over 64 000 nodes in a network, consisting of subnetworks with 255
nodes in star, cluster, or mesh topologies. As ZigBee nodes can operate at dis-
tances ranging from 5 to 500 metres depending on the surrounding environment,
very large networks are possible both regarding large number of devices and large
coverage areas. Range is easily adjusted with power[34].
There are two different physical device types used for ZigBee nodes, called Full
Function Device (FFD) and Reduced Function Device (RFD). Their different char-
actersistics are showed in figure 3.4 on the following page. In a ZigBee network,
at least one FFD is required, to act as a network coordinator. Since these devices
consume more power than the RFDs they are generally line powered.
34                    CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES




                      Figure 3.4: ZigBee physical device types


ZigBee is designed for low-duty-cycle networks, where nodes spend much of their
life asleep. A typical conversation between two devices generally takes a few mil-
liseconds, allowing the transceiver to go back to sleep quickly. Thus, nodes use
very little power, and can operate for years on a pair of alkaline AA batteries with-
out any operator intervention.
A basic ZigBee node is very small, has low complexity, low cost. It consists of a
multichannel two-way radio and a microcontroller on a single piece of silicon, and
could be delivered in a plastic package the size of a pinkie fingernail. Retail price of
radio tranceivers compliant with the standard is rapidly approaching $1, and single-
package radio/applications processor/memory products are currently about $3 and
will probably continue to fall with increasing volumes. The first ZigBee products
are expected in stores in 2007. Potential applications are sensors, interactive toys,
smart badges, remote controls, and home automation.



Ultra Wide Band (UWB) and IEEE 802.15.3a

The term ultra wideband (UWB) was first used by DARPA in 1989. But the tech-
nology behind the name has been known since the 1960s as short-pulse technology,
in which the basic concept is to develop, transmit and receive an extremely short
duration burst of radio frequency (RF) energy. These bursts represent from one to
only a few cycles of an RF carrier wave, and the resultant waveforms are extremely
broadband. Duty cycles are very low, resulting in low average energy densities.
The pulses are typically generated by impulse- or step-excited antennas and filters.
The conventional definition of UWB described above is quite unlike modern UWB
variants. From 2002, the FCC came up with a new, broader definition of UWB,
which defines UWB as a RF signal occupying a portion of the frequency spectrum
that is greater than 20% of the center carrier frequency, or has a bandwidth greater
than 500 MHz [35, 36, 37].
From the two definitions above we can see that UWB is a communication chan-
nel that spreads information out over a very wide portion of the frequency spec-
trum [38, 39]. This allows the UWB transmitters to consume very little transmit
3.3. RADIO FREQUENCY (RF)                                                         35

energy, while transmitting large amounts of data. In addition, UWB will not in-
terfere with existing RF systems if proper designed, has high multipath immunity,
will be low cost like Bluetooth components, and will enable radios to fit within
small-size devices. UWB is proposed as a wireless replacement of wired USB
and Firewire standards used among devices in a personal area network. Wireless
connection for multimedia applications requiring in excess of 100 Mbps can be
realised.
There are few technical hurdles for UWB, but it faces several regulatory hurdles
in regard to interoperability. The FCC approved low power UWB with maximum
radiated power of -41.3dBm/MHz to operate in an unlicensed spectrum from 3.1
GHz to 10.6 GHz in the US in February 2002. The strict power limitation is in
order to limit the interference with other communication systems. There are lim-
ited adoption by other regulatory agencies around the world. Europe and Japan
approval is in the process, while others are waiting to see how UWB performs in
the US.
There are currently two competing UWB specifications that both hope to eventually
be defined as the IEEE 802.15.3a standard (member of the WPAN family). Which
one, if either, the standard group chooses is not yet known, and how widely UWB
will be adopted in the future is uncertain.
The main difference between the two competing UWB specifications is the way
in which they spread the data signal across the frequency spectrum. The Multi-
band OFDM Alliance (MBOA) special interest group uses OFDM like 802.11a
and 802.11g, while the former Motorola subsidiary Freescale Semiconductor uses
direct sequence technology.


UWB as Positioning Technology UWB technology has been shown to possess
a unique advantage for high accuracy positioning, even in the presence of severe
multipath, by the use of short-pulse RF waveforms which permit accurate determi-
nation of the TOA and the time of flight of a burst transmission from a short-pulse
transmitter to a corresponding receiver. This require special, sensitive, high speed
detection circuitry at the receivers. With distances computed from the time of flight
at several receivers, the position of the UWB transmitter can be determined by tri-
lateration, as we saw in 2.2.4 on page 18.


3.3.3 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a generic term used to describe a system
that transmits the identity of an object or person wirelessly using radio waves [40].
It is grouped under the broad category of automatic identification technologies.
The RFID technology is most commonly used to automatically identify objects
36                   CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES




                Figure 3.5: A summary of passive vs active RFID




in large systems. RFID-tags are attached to all the objects in a system that the
owners want to keep some information about, so that this information easily can be
retrieved and used later. The RFID-tags consist of a microship which can typically
store up to 2 kilobytes of data, and a radio antenna. A reader device is used to
retrieve information from the tags, and depending on the tags used between 20 and
1,000 tags can be read each second. The best tags also work effectively even when
situated within one-half inch of each other [41].
There are two broad categories of RFID systems: active and passive. These are
summarised in figure 3.5. The passive RFID systems use passive RFID tags, which
have no transmitter and no power source. They work by drawing power from the
reader, which emits electromagnetic waves, and communicates its data by reflect-
ing back energy to the reader. In contrast, the active tags used in active RFID
systems have a transmitter and their own power source. They broadcast signals for
all the readers within range to read. The range is typically between 20 to 100 me-
tres for active tags, while the passive tags have read ranges from a few centimetres
up to about 9 metres. The cost of passive tags ranges from 20 cent when bought in
large volumes to several dollars with special packaging, while the active tags can
be $10 to $50 or more. These tags are not mass-produced in large numbers, so they
are typically used in in-house systems where the tags can be reused.
RFID systems use low, high, ultra-high, or microwave frequencies. Active tags
usually operate at 455 MHz, 2.45 GHz, or 5.8 GHz, and passive tags uses 124,
125, 135 kHz, 13.56 MHz, 860-960 MHz, and 2.45 GHz and others. The dif-
ferent properties of these frequencies make them useful for different applications.
Higher frequency gives better range but is harder to control because energy is sent
over long distances and is easier reflected. The radio waves can bounce off sur-
faces and reach tags you did not want to read. RFID signals may be subject to
interference from machinery or other RF-based systems, but fortunately not from
802.11-systems.
3.4. ULTRASOUND (US)                                                               37

RFID as Positioning Technology Passive RFID tags can only be located by as-
sociating them with the reader that reads them. If high accuracy is required and
the readers are not carried by a person, the system needs a lot of readers, which
make the system expensive. Active tags can act as transponders which broadcast
only when near a reader, or they can act as beacons which broadcast at pre-set
time intervals. The beacon functionality makes it possible to use RFID in real-time
systems where the precise location of objects needs to be tracked. The readers
are placed in known positions, read the tags, and transmits the tag id, it’s own
id and a time stamp to a host computer system which can track the objects. The
most common RFID applications are asset-tracking, manufacturing, supply chain
management, retailing, payment systems (e.g. road tolls), and security and access
control.



3.4 Ultrasound (US)

Ultrasound does not penetrate solid walls, and does not require line of sight be-
tween the tags and the detector. Ultrasound waves are mechanical waves, and do
not interfere with electromagnetic waves. The ultrasound signals have relatively
short communications range [42].
The disadvantages of a system using ultrasound are loss of signal due to obstruc-
tion; false signals due to reflections; and interference from high frequency sounds
such as keys jangling. There are commercial systems which solve these prob-
lems with great success, but these systems are expensive, typically costing over
$15,000 [43].


Ultrasound as Positioning Technology Positioning with ultrasound is suitable
for both proximity sensing and multilateration. Especially for applications where
room scale accuracy is sufficient, proximity sensing with ultrasound is very effec-
tive since ultrasound does not penetrate walls. Such use is suitable for personell and
asset/equipment tracking in large buildings. In addition, the fact that ultrasound is
relatively short range can be an advantage in such a system, because large halls or
open areas can be divided in several zones, thus giving better accuracy [42]. On
the other hand, it can be expensive to cover a large building with this solution.
In systems where high accuracy is required, multilateration 2.2.4 on page 18 can
be used to achieve centimetre accuracy. Distances are calculated by measuring
ultrasound time of flight. For very high accuracy, several fixed infrastructure sta-
tions must be used, increasing cost and complexity. The frequencies typically used
are 40–75 kHz, permitting accurate transmitter-receiver distance measurements at
ranges up to 10 metres [17]. The lower bound of frequencies that can be used
are limited because we want to use frequencies above those that humans can hear,
38                       CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES

while the upper bound is restricted by the absorption of ultrasound in air which
increases with higher frequencies.
The speed of ultrasound in air is about 340 m/s at room temperature. This is rel-
atively slow compared to electromagnetic radiation in vacuum at almost 300 000
000 m/s, commonly called just speed of light. The slow speed has two main effects
for ultrasound lateration [17]. First, ultrasound lateration systems do not need to be
as complex as those using radio frequency, because timing units with microsecond
resolution are sufficient for sub-centimetre accuracy. In RF lateration systems a
timing error of only 1 nanosecond gives a distance measurement error of 30 cm.
Second, position readings can have a time lag of tens of milliseconds, but this is
still sufficient for most location based servics.
Precise distance measurements require sensitive US sensors, but such sensors react
to ultrasonic2 noise and high-energy sound pulses from for example malfunction-
ing fluorescent lights, people jangling keys, and slamming doors. Accurate dis-
tance estimation therefore requires good outlier rejection methods to prevent use
of bad distance measurements [20].
Another advantage for indoor tracking is that it does not require line of sight, so that
objects that are hidden or located in drawers or filing cabinets still can be tracked.
But when there is no line of sight, distance measurements in multilateration gives
reduced accuracy.




3.5 Other Positioning Technologies

3.5.1 Electromagnetic Sensing

Positioning systems based on electromagnetic sensing can provide very high ac-
curacy and precision, on the order of less than 1 mm spatial resolution, 1 ms time
resolution and 0.1 degrees orientation capability [11]. Such systems are mostly
used by people working with virtual reality and motion capture for computer ani-
mation. The main reasons for not considering this technology further here are that
the implementation costs are very high, the tracked object with attached sensors
must be tethered to a control unit and hence is not completely mobile, and that
such systems typically works in specialised, controlled environments.


    2
      According to www.dictionary.com, the term “ultrasonic” is an adjective which describes some-
thing utilising ultrasound.
3.6. SUMMARY                                                                      39

3.5.2 Optical Systems

Optical systems either use a set of cameras placed at static points in the environ-
ment to monitor objects in that environment, or the cameras are attached to an
object so that the object’s position and orientation can be determined relative to
static points placed around the environment [17]. Different methods for computing
positions using these schemes can be used, but they will not be discussed here. Al-
though levels of accuracy and resolution similar to those of electromagnetic track-
ing can be achieved, the disadvantages of optical systems make them unsuitable
for most but a few types of applications. The cameras require line of sight, need
substantial amounts of processing power to analyse captured frames, tend to be
expensive and mechanically complex, and are most useful in well-constrained en-
vironments.


3.5.3 Detecting Physical Contact

As we saw in section 2.2.4 on page 20, one of the methods for proximity sensing is
to detect physical contact. For example, there exist systems which have embedded
pressure sensors in the floor [11, 5], and by capturing footsteps or by analysing
the distribution of weight across the floor, the presence of moving objects can be
inferred. The major advantage with these systems is that no tags or devices are
needed, but they suffer from poor scalability and high incremental costs to install
the pressure sensors. In addition, they can only provide two-dimensional position-
ing, and it is hard to distinguish objects from each other. Other systems may use
touch sensors, but these also suffer more or less from the disadvantages already
mentioned.


3.6 Summary

We have now reviewed wireless technologies that can be used for indoor position-
ing. These are divided into three groups, based on which physical carrier they
use: infrared, radio or ultrasound. An understanding of the different technologies’
characteristics is necessary for understanding possibilities, challenges and limita-
tions in positioning systems. In the next chapter, we will look closer at positioning
systems used by existing location systems.
40   CHAPTER 3. INDOOR POSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES
Chapter 4

Existing Indoor Location Systems

From reading the previous chapters, we have learned about the basics for under-
standing positioning systems. In chapter 2 we learned about their components,
designs, properties, and how they actually can decide positions. In chapter 3 we
studied wireless technologies and how these can be used for positioning.
In this chapter we will finally examine existing location systems that have been
described in the literature or that are commercially available. With reference to
our three-layered model, we are talking about layer 1 and layer 2, as shown in
figure 4.1 on the next page. A location system in layer 2 includes an underlying
positioning system, turns the physical positions from this system into locations,
and does all the work needed before a location based service can make use of these
locations.
While there are too many location systems to describe them all, an attempt is made
to choose a representative collection which shows the variety of solutions. This
knowledge will be applied in the next chapters, where we will look at a specific
case where a museum needs a location system to support a mobile electronic tour
guide, and analyse if existing technologies and systems are capable of meeting
their needs.
Although we will look at both academic and commercial systems in the following,
academic systems are given most emphasis. The reason is that with commercial
systems it is often difficult to get behind the scenes and see the details of how
the systems work. We should also keep in mind that what commercial companies
claim that their systems are able to provide, is sometimes overstated or true in only
very limited situations.

positioning systems.


4.1 The Classic Four

When reading literature on location systems, four systems quickly stand out as
they are referred to almost everywhere: the Active Badge, Active Bat, Cricket, and
RADAR systems. Thus, we will call them “The Classic Four”. The Active Badge
system from 1992 is among the first indoor LBCSs, and as we will see in the
following sections, the others followed more or less directly as attempts to deal
with limitations in this system in three very different ways. Later systems are often
based on findings from these four different solutions. Thus, the “classic four” are
described in detail in the following sections, and then follow brief descriptions of
other systems, grouped after which technology they are based on.


4.1.1 Active Badge

The Active Badge system [44, 4] was developed at Olivetti Research Laboratory1
between 1989 and 1992. The original system is able to locate individuals in a
building by monitoring their presence in different rooms. This is done by equip-
ping rooms with one or more networked sensors, which detect diffuse infrared
transmissions emitted by Active Badges. The badges are worn by individuals, and
they emit unique identifiers every 10 seconds [24] or on demand. In the latter case,
the badge can be told to transmit by pressing a button on it. A master station is
polling the sensors for information about which badges they have recently seen,
and the location of the badge can be determined on the basis of this information.
The range of the system is about 30 metres, and line of sight is not necessary [24].
The conventional batteries of the badges last for about one year with the time in-
tervals between emissions set to 10 seconds [24].
In an experiment with the Active Badge system, a hybrid technology solution is
used to offer more fine grained location [4]. Low-powered radio transmitters are

4.1. THE CLASSIC FOUR                                                             43




                           Figure 4.2: An Active Badge


placed where the badges should discover special zones. When a badge notices
the presence of a radio frequency field, it codes a signal into the infrared signal
which identifies which radio field it has moved into. The badge then immediately
transmits this message. The radio transmitters are typically placed at desks, and
power-adjusted to have a range of about an arm’s length [24]. A further extension
to the Active Badge system has been to also track equipment, by attaching slightly
modified equipment badges to objects. Equipment is not as mobile as people, so
the time interval between emitted signals is increased to five minutes, thus saving
more power.
The largest single Active Badge system has been deployed at Cambridge Univer-
sity Computer Laboratory, where over 200 badges and 300 sensors were in daily
use. An experiment with equipment badges and desk scale location technology is
also implemented, with about 200 items of badged equipment and about 50 desks
identified by using the hybrid radio/infrared scheme [24].



4.1.2 Active Bat

In the previous section we saw that the Active Badge system could provide room-
scale location information. By using radio transmitters in addition to the infrared
sensors, finer grain location was possible in dedicated locations. Since many ap-
plications need more fine-grained position information and sometimes also orien-
tation information, the AT&T researchers have in more recent work developed the
Active Bat location system [45]. In this system, people and objects to be located
are equipped with wireless devices called Bats, and receivers connected by a wired
network are installed in known, fixed positions in the ceiling. In addition, the sys-
tem includes a number of base stations. A base station periodically transmits a
radio message which contains a Bat identifier. Simultaneously, it sends a reset sig-
nal to the receivers in its range over the wired network. As a response to the radio
message, the identified Bat transmits an ultrasonic pulse. The now synchronised
receivers record the time of arrivals of the pulse, which are used to compute posi-
44                   CHAPTER 4. EXISTING INDOOR LOCATION SYSTEMS

tion by lateration (see 2.2.4 on page 18). Because all receivers are ceiling-mounted,
the transmitters are always below them. Thus, position calculation can be done us-
ing only three distance measurements, rather than the four required in the general
case [5]. This is an example of domain specific knowledge which makes computa-
tion easier, as mentioned in section 2.2.4 on page 18.
An ultrasonic transmission from a Bat is mainly emitted in one direction, because
the wearer’s body or the object shadows the ultrasonic signals. Knowing the pattern
of receivers that detect the signal tells something about the object’s orientation [5].
Another, better solution to determine orientation is to place several Bats at known,
non-collinear positions on the same object, and calculate these Bats’ positions.
                                                     m
The Bat system is installed in a three-floor, 1,000 2 office building with 750 re-
ceiver units, three radio cells, and 200 Bats. The Bats measure about 8 x 4 x 2 cm,
and draw power from a single AA lithium cell which with low-power features has
a lifetime of about 1 year. One of the low-power features is that each Bat has a
motion detector, which helps the base stations to locate only the Bats that are mov-
ing. To simplify maintenance, telemetry can be obtained from Bats, and they can
be reprogrammed in the field over wireless or wired networks. 3D positioning in
Active Bat is accurate to within 3 cm about 95 percent of the time [45]. The maxi-
mum position update rate across each radio cell is 150 updates per second. Signals
from simultaneously triggered Bats are encoded in a way that allows receivers to
distinguish among them.



4.1.3 Cricket

Researchers from MIT started to work on the Cricket indoor location system fall
1999, and Cricket v1 got its first users by the spring of 2001 [20, 6]. In July 2004
Cricket v2—which addresses most of the shortcomings of the previous version—
was ready. Cricket hardware units are commercially available, and hardware design
and software are open-source [46].
Cricket is the result of the five design goals given below [6]:


User privacy Cricket was designed to avoid the user privacy problem inherent in
     previous tracking systems like Active Badge ( 4.1.1 on page 42) and Active
     Bat ( 4.1.2 on the page before), by letting devices learn their location rather
     than having the system tracking them. Thus, Cricket inverts the architecture
     of those earlier systems [20]; instead of having the mobile device emitting
     signals to be received by the infrastructure, in Cricket the infrastructure emits
     signals that the mobile device receive and use to infer its location. Thus,
     Cricket is a self-positioning system, while Active Badge and Active Bat are
     remote-positioning systems (discussed in 2.2.2 on page 13).
4.1. THE CLASSIC FOUR                                                                          45

Decentralised administration There should be no need for a central entity to
     keep track of each component in the system, and no explicit coordination be-
     tween infrastructure transmitters. This, and the choice of a self-positioning
     architecture, helps the system scale easily, and makes it easy to employ since
     the transmitters don’t need to be connected to each other or to any other in-
     frastructure [20].

Network heterogeneity Cricket should be able to provide information to devices
     regardless of their type of network connectivity. This is achieved by decou-
     pling the Cricket system from other data communication mechanisms.

Low cost The Cricket devices can be made from inexpensive, commercial off-
     the-shelf components, resulting in a price of less than $10 for each de-
     vice [6]. They are also commercially available at $225 (in low volumes)
     in the U.S. [47].

Portion-of-a-room granularity The system should accurately demarcate bound-
      aries between rooms and parts of rooms. The first is easy, since ultrasound
      doesn’t travel through walls, but it is also designed to accurately demarcate
      virtual parts of a room which correspond to different spaces.

Cricket can provide two forms of location information, names associated with
rooms or parts of rooms—called space identifiers—and position coordinates. The
most common way to use Cricket is to place Cricket beacons on walls and/or ceil-
ings, and attach Cricket listeners to host devices whose location needs to be ob-
tained. The beacon and listener hardware are identical, the difference is in the
running software [46]. This makes the Cricket infrastructure quite flexible, in that
you can also run the beacon on a moving device, or configure all Cricket devices
to simultaneously function as both a beacon and a listener [46].
The Cricket system works by having the beacons periodically broadcast their po-
sition information—space identifier and/or position coordinates2 — on a radio fre-
quency (RF) channel. Simultaneously, they also broadcast an ultrasonic pulse.
Listeners that are in the radio range of a beacon, have line of sight to it, and are in
the ultrasonic range from it, will thus receive both an RF signal and an ultrasonic
signal. Because RF travels about 106 times faster than ultrasound, the listener can
then use the time difference of arrival between the start of the RF signal and the
corresponding ultrasonic pulse to infer its distance from the beacon. This is how
Cricket solve the problem with synchronising the beacons and the listeners. The
listener provides the location information of the beacon and the associated distance
to the host device through an API, and the listener or host device infers its position
from such information from multiple beacons.
   2
     Actually, in v2, the beacons send their unique ID’s, and the applications download a database
which maps beacon ID’s and space/coordinate information [20].
46                  CHAPTER 4. EXISTING INDOOR LOCATION SYSTEMS

There are also disadvantages with the Cricket architecture [20]. Since the Cricket
beacons broadcast their location information, this has to be given to them in ad-
vance when deploying the system. Configuring spatial information in the beacons
is easy, while configuring accurate position coordinates is cumbersome. Continous
tracking of objects is harder because a listener hears only one beacon at a time,
and updating the position thus takes longer time and is more complex. Cricket also
needs a distributed beacon scheduling scheme to avoid RF and ultrasound colli-
sions at the listeners. Finally, the power consumption of the Cricket units is high,
and the batteries have to be replaced pretty often. Attempting to solve this prob-
lem an adaptor was made for plugging the beacons directly in the wall outlets, but
this is laying constraints on where beacons could be placed. Another solution is to
use solar cells which use energy from the fluorescent lighting system often used in
office buildings. This works fairly well and may be the future solution, although
some problems still exist for example in dim lighting or when the lights are turned
off. Regarding the latest Cricket listeners, they interface to a host using a compact
flash interface. Thus, they can draw power from the host, eliminating the need for
a battery.
Cricket can be as accurate as between 1 and 3 cm in real deployments [46]. The
radios run at a frequency of 433 Mhz, with the default transmit power level and
antennas providing a range of about 30 metres indoors when there are no obstacles.
The maximum ultrasound range is 10.5 metres when the listener and the beacon are
facing each other and there are no obstacles between them.



4.1.4 RADAR

RADAR is a radio-frequency (RF) based system for locating and tracking users in-
side buildings. The system was developed by researchers from Microsoft Research,
and their work was published in two articles early 2000 [7, 19]. The goal was to
overcome an important limitation of earlier systems: the need for specialised in-
frastructure implemented solely for locating users. The approach was to make use
of existing RF wireless local area networks (WLANs) to provide accurate user lo-
cation and tracking capabilities. In this way the costs of the positioning system can
be dramatically lowered because no additional hardware is required. It should be
noted that RADAR’s goal is the opposite of the network heterogeneity design goal
of Cricket in the previous section. Cricket provides location information to devices
regardless of their type of network connectivity at the cost of requiring additional
infrastructure, while RADAR eliminates the need for such extra infrastructure at
the cost of providing location information of WLAN-devices only.
The base stations in a RADAR-enhanced WLAN system are positioned to pro-
vide overlapping coverage, and broadcast beacons periodically. Mobile WLAN-
equipped receivers record beacon signal strengths, which can be used to infer
4.2. INFRARED-BASED LOCATION SYSTEMS                                              47

distance for use in trilateration (see 2.2.4 on page 19 and 2.2.4 on page 18). To
determine locations, RADAR uses a radio map—a database that maps measured
signal strengths to position coordinates. The major part of the work in deploying
RADAR is to construct this Radio Map, which can be built using two different
approaches. In the first, empirical approach, a mobile user is walking around the
building and explicitly measure and record base station signal strengths at different
known locations. In the second approach, a mathematical model of indoor RF sig-
nal propagation is used. The first approach is superior in terms of accuracy, while
the latter makes deployment easier.
To improve accuracy RADAR uses continous user tracking, which means to use
information from the past to make better guesses of user location. This is based on
physical constraints, in that the user is very likely to be near a previous location.
The aliasing problem, that two locations that are physically far apart is close to
each other in signal strength, can be solved using this technique. The aliasing
problem may arise if for example there is an obstruction between a receiver and
a base stations that are close to each other, while there is no obstruction between
the base station and a receiver that is farther away. By knowing the user’s previous
position, measurements with large deviations can be discarded. Another technique
used by RADAR to improve accuracy is environment profiling, which is to use
multiple Radio Maps representing different environmental conditions, for example
how crowded a place is. Human bodies consist of a lot of water, and water absorbs
RF signals. Thus, a Radio Map created after work hours with very few people in
the building will not reflect the environment at a different time, like lunch hour,
very well.
RADAR has been deployed in an area of 980 square metres with over 50 rooms,
covered by three base stations. The accuracy is about 2-3 metres—about the size
of a typical office room—50% of the time with the empirical radio map approach.
With the radio propagation model the accuracy is about 4.3 metres 50% of the time.



4.2 Infrared-based Location Systems

4.2.1 PARCTAB

The PARCTAB system [48, 49] was a research prototype developed at Xerox
PARC between 1992 and 1995. This system is similar to the Active Badge sys-
tem in that it provides room scale positioning accuracy by utilising a networked
infrastructure that listens for diffuse infrared transmissions from the users’ de-
vices. These, the PARCTABs, are personal digital assistants (PDAs) with several
IR diodes spaced around the case and they also have a multi directional receiver.
The IR diodes used are wide angle LEDs to ensure diffuse infrared emissions.
48                  CHAPTER 4. EXISTING INDOOR LOCATION SYSTEMS

The networked tranceivers have 24 IR emitters spaced with 15 degree intervals for
complete coverage in all directions, and two detectors that provide 360 degrees
viewing angle. The range is about 6 metres, and when placed in the ceiling in
the middle of a room it provides very good coverage. The diffuse emissions make
LOS not necessary, because tranceivers and PARCTABs can sense infrared light
reflected from surfaces. The researchers report that if there already are a networked
computer in the room it would only take about 15 minutes to install a tranceiver.


4.2.2 Locust Swarm

Locust Swarm [23] is another infrared system. It differs from the Active Badge and
PARCTAB systems in that the infrastructure nodes, the Locusts, are wireless and
that they broadcast their location information for the user’s device to listen to to
ensure user privacy. The Locusts are measuring about 3 x 8 cm, and are connected
to a small solar cell panel measuring about 15 x 15 cm. They are placed in the grills
beneath overhead fluorescent lights, and draw all their power in this way and don’t
need batteries. One Locust covers an area of about 6 metres in diameter, depending
on the distance to the floor. In 1999 one Locust could be made for under $20. The
user device could be any device with a proper infrared receiver.


4.2.3 IRIS-LPS

IRIS-LPS (Infrared Indoor Scout) is an optical infrared local positioning system
developed at the Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany, and published
in 2003 [50]. The system consists of a number of IR emitting tags and a stationary
mounted stereo camera. All hardware is made of cheap off-the-shelf components.
The stereo camera consists of two USB cameras with 120 degree lenses mounted
20 cm from each other. The cameras measure angle of arrival of light emitted from
the tags, and this is used to triangulate the tags. The light results in a bright spot
in the image, and the size and the density of the spot is used to determine distance.
The stereo camera is connected to a PC which decompress the images and performs
the real-time image processing. There could be up to 100 tags.
To determine the accuracy of the system it was installed in a lecture hall. The
camera was mounted in front of the blackboard, three metres above the floor. It
covered almost the entire room, which measures 15 x 9 metres. The tag itself
is smaller than the battery, and consists of one LED with a narrow angle of 20
degrees and range over 10 metres. An exposure time of 1/500 second is enough for
the camera to detect the signal. The accuracy decrease with increasing distance and
angle from the camera and was about 8 cm in near range and 16 cm when covering
                     m
a room of about 100 2 .
4.3. RADIO-BASED LOCATION SYSTEMS                                                49




                Figure 4.3: A prototype headset used in IRIS-LPS.


In an application using the positioning system the users wore headsets with eight
IR diodes mounted on top of it, each covering 45 degrees. This was done to get
a greater total coverage, because smaller angle gives better range. By letting the
diodes point in different directions very good coverage is achieved. By placing the
emitting diodes on the head, the problem with IR requiring line of sight was solved.




4.3 Radio-based Location Systems

4.3.1 WLAN Based Systems

Ekahau

Ekahau [51] is a Finnish company that offers real time, multi-floor location track-
ing of WiFi-devices or WiFi-tags in any standard Wi-Fi network (802.11 a/b/g).
Average accuracy up to 1 metre in less than a second is achieved indoors by use of
5–7 access points, or 2–3 metres average accuracy by use of 3–5 access points. The
patented Ekahau location-sensing system is a software-only solution that works
with any off-the-shelf Wi-Fi access point. No proprietary infrastructure is needed.
Both zone based tracking, to report the device location by zone name, and con-
tinuous real-time positioning of precise x, y, floor, heading, speed, etc. location
coordinates are supported. The system is able to locate over 100 devices per sec-
ond on a typical desktop PC, and more with more powerful hardware.
Ekahau uses a probabilistic approach to location sensing [52]. Signal strength data
from various known locations infer a model that can be used to make predictions
about the location associated with a set of new signal strength data. Building such
a model involves the construction of a probability function which estimates the
probability that a particular measurement corresponds to a particular position. This
can be seen as a special case of the scene analysis technique used in RADAR.
The first big advantage with Ekahau’s approach is that the time needed for site
calibration (a walk-through in the environment to collect sample points for building
50                     CHAPTER 4. EXISTING INDOOR LOCATION SYSTEMS

the model) is much shorter than for building a radio map as used by RADAR.
                                                             m
Approximate time needed is only 1 hour per 1,200 2 . The second big advantage
is that minor environment changes like number of people or furniture arrangement
do not require re-calibration of the positioning model. Partial re-calibration is only
required when access points are moved or heavy structures are modified in the
coverage area.


Cordis RadioEye

The Cordis RadioEye System (CRE) is a Norwegian price winning technology3
for indoor positioning which is able to provide the physical coordinates of 802.11b
WiFi devices. The system consists of a roof mounted unit—a RadioEye—measuring
25x25x7 cm with advanced antenna technology that can be compared to the facet
eye of a fly. By analysing the signal spectrum of microwaves emitted from the mo-
bile devices, the system can determine their coordinates as long as there is line of
sight between the RadioEye and the devices. This positioning technique is unique
and patented by Radionor [53].
CRE is able to provide accuracy up to 50 cm, or it could provide coverage of 2000
square metres per RadioEye. Devices can be monitored with a coverage angle
of 110 degrees, and a tradeoff between coverage and accuracy is required since
accuracy decreases when the coverage area gets bigger. The system is able to
compute 1000 positions per second [54].
A Norwegian company has tried both the Radionor and Ekahau solutions. They
report that EPE has longer latency in delivering location than the RadioEye, which
means that this system may not be as real-time as they claim. A user moving
rapidly may have moved far between two position updates.


4.3.2 Bluetooth Based Systems

An Indoor Bluetooth-based Positioning System

A team from Hanover has implemented a Bluetooth-based indoor positioning sys-
tem [55]. The system is based on self-positioning, where the position estimation
occurs in the mobile device without the need of changes in the already fixed in-
stalled Bluetooth network. Positioning is done by trilateration using received signal
strength (RSSI). Achieved positioning error for the system is given by a deviation
of 2 metres on average.
For precise position estimation, the correlation between distance and RSSI has to
   3
     The 2004 European IST-Prize, The Rosing Prize for IT Product of the Year 2003, and The Rosing
Creativity Prize 2003
4.3. RADIO-BASED LOCATION SYSTEMS                                                   51

be determined (see 2.2.4 on page 19). Because of the radio propagation effects
and potentially no LOS, caused by for example the person holding the Bluetooth
device, the equation for signal propagation in free-fields is not suited for the indoor
area. To approximate the correlation between signal strength and distance that fits
the environmental conditions an empirical approach is taken. This is described in
the training phase below.
The implemented system consists of three Bluetooth access points and one Blue-
                                    m
tooth enabled PDA. The room is 46 2 and virtually divided in 1 x 1 metre sections.
The work with splitting the premises in sections and placing the access points is
called the preparatory phase. To obtain a good approximation function between
the RSSI and the access point distances, several measurements are recorded in
each of a number of randomly chosen sections. This is called the training phase.
The mean of all measurements belonging to one section and access point forms
the reference value of the RSSI in the section. The third phase is called the loca-
tion phase. Here the distances to the access points are determined based on RSSI
measurements, and the trilateration method is employed to find the position of the
PDA.
The Bluetooth specification does not provide any means for extracting the RSSI
value directly, so that this value has to be computed from another value. It turns
out that this limits the maximal distance between an access point and the mobile
device to 8 metres, and thus restricts the coverage of the positioning system. In
addition, the accuracy of the value which the computed RSSI is inferred from is
also not standardised, and depends on the Bluetooth hardware manufacturer.



BIPS

BIPS [56] is another Bluetooth-based indoor positioning system, which is simi-
lar to the IR-based Active Badge system. Both systems are designed for tracking
people with room-scale accuracy by cellular proximity sensing throughout a build-
ing. BIPS uses this to offer a service that allows a mobile user to visualise on his
portable, Bluetooth-enabled device the shortest path he has to follow in order to
reach another mobile user inside the same building. To do this, the system keeps
location information about all users in a central database.
BIPS defines a room as a space that can fit into a circle of 10 metres radius, since
this is the maximum coverage area of a Bluetooth device. The system consists of a
set of Bluetooth cells, one for every significant room of the building. The Bluetooth
access points are interconnected via an Ethernet LAN with a central server machine
containing the location database. The database is updated whenever an access point
detects a new device in its coverage area.
As we saw in the section about the Bluetooth standard ( 3.3.2 on page 31), a po-
52                  CHAPTER 4. EXISTING INDOOR LOCATION SYSTEMS

tentially time-consuming process is required to establish a connection between a
master and a slave. This is the major concern of BIPS. The masters (the access
points) must dedicate a certain percentage of their working time to device discov-
ery and the remaining time to serve the slaves (the mobile devices). BIPS has done
experiments for defining the scheduling policy of a master, and found that if the
master spends 3.84 seconds on device discovery, then 95% of the slaves will be
discovered on average. This is satisfactory for BIPS, and it means that the average
load of tracking service is about 24% of the operational cycle.


Bluetooth Indoor Localisation System (BILS)

This system is able to determine the position of any Bluetooth-enabled mobile de-
vice with an intended accuracy of about 1 metre in indoor environments. The major
advantage of the system besides the good accuracy is that additional hardware is
needed only on the stationary base stations. No hardware or software need to be
added or changed on the mobile Bluetooth-devices to be located [57].
One of the four base stations needed to determine location in three dimensions is
also master station, and it broadcasts a data packet containing a correlation code.
When the other base stations receive this signal, they start internal time measure-
ment counters. When the mobile device receives the signal, it replies by broadcast-
ing the same data packet again, which upon arrival at the base stations stops the
time measurements. The four base stations measure the TDOAs for the signal trav-
eling from the mobile to the base stations using specialised correlation hardware.
The measurements are then collected at a host PC, where the position of the mobile
will be calculated and evaluated by DTDOA taking the local coordinates of the base
stations into account. The big advantage with this scheme is that the base stations
don’t need to be synchronised with each other or with the mobile devices, since it
is time differences that are measured and not time of arrivals. It is the specialised
correlation hardware at the base stations that make it possible to determine the ex-
act receive time, but because of the very high accuracy requirements it is mainly
limited to line of sight conditions, because obstructions will introduce propagation
delays which will make the time measurements mirror wrong distances. Thus, the
base stations should be placed in the upper corners of a room.


4.3.3 PAL650 UWB System

An example of an UWB positioning system is the PAL650 system, an FCC ap-
proved, commercial precision asset location system which is being used for track-
ing of high valued assets in hospitals, factories, and military facilities. The system
consists of a set of active UWB tags, one of which is used as calibration or refer-
ence tag, UWB receivers, and a central processing hub. Three or more receivers
4.4. ULTRASOUND-BASED LOCATION SYSTEMS                                                        53

are placed at known positions within or around the area to be monitored. At startup
the system is calibrated by monitoring data from the reference tag which is placed
at a known location. The tags produce bursts of short-pulse RF emissions once
every second, and the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the bursts are mea-
sured at the various receivers and sent back to the central hub for processing. The
tags are powered by one 3.0-V 1A-h Lithium cell battery, which lasts for approxi-
mately 4 years. The range of a tag in indoor environments is typically 60 metres,
between several walls, and an absolute tag positioning accuracy better than 30 cm
is routinely achieved [36].



4.4 Ultrasound-based Location Systems

4.4.1 DOLPHIN

The Active Bat and Cricket systems described in the previous sections are able to
provide very precise indoor positioning. But, deploying these systems in large-
scale environments require manual configuration of a large number of infrastruc-
ture sensor nodes, because these are required to have inherent knowledge of their
positions4 . DOLPHIN5 is an ultrasonic positioning system developed to reduce
such configuration costs [58, 59].
DOLPHIN is similar to Active Bat and Cricket in that a reference node broadcast
an RF signal and an ultrasonic signal simultaneously so that surrounding nodes
can measure the TDOA used for distance measurement. With three such measure-
ments position can be computed by trilateration. The difference in DOLPHIN is
that by using a distributed positioning algorithm only a few nodes have to be pre-
configured with their exact position. For example, if reference nodes A-C are used
by node D to determine its position, node E can determine its position based on
nodes B-D and so on. With this approach even nodes outside the coverage area of
the reference nodes can be positioned.
The disadvantage of DOLPHIN’s approach is that a positioning error in a node
affects all later positioning determinations based on this node, direct or indirect. In
the test implementation of the system, which consists of only 3 reference nodes and
four other nodes, the positioning accuracy at a node using only reference points for
positioning was less than 5 cm, degrading to 10-15 cm in nodes that used this first
node for positioning. This error propagation problem is unavoidable, but can be
minimised by proper placement and number of reference nodes. It should also be
noted that the current test implementations of DOLPHIN assumes that all devices

are static. Handling moving devices and techniques for improving the accuracy are
the current focus of the researchers behind DOLPHIN.


4.4.2 Bristol Indoor Positioning System

The Bristol indoor positioning system (Bristol) is another ultrasonic system that
tries to cope with one of the disadvantages of the Active Bat and Cricket systems.
The goal is to reduce costs by using only minimal infrastructure and readily avail-
able components. A simple system covering a room of about 4 x 7 metres and
providing accuracies of 10–15 centimetres can be implemented for only $150 [43].
As in the Active Bat system, a radio signal is used for synchronising transmitters
and receivers, and distances are computed by measuring time of flight of ultrasonic
signals. The system is self-positioning and uses four ceiling-mounted transmitters
connected to a transmitter module containing the ultrasonic drivers, the microcon-
troller and the radio transmitter. The receiver is attached to a host computer or to
the shoulder of a person. Line of sight is required. A rechargeable 9 v battery in the
receiver module will last only for one day. However, the system is easy to install
and requires no calibration after the initial installation. But for large scale use the
costs will increase.
Bristol is tested with several configurations. Four US transmitters can also cover a
8 x 8 m room with an accuracy of 15 cm, or a 8 x 16 m room with 20 cm accuracy.
A larger configuration of 6 US transmitters at a height of seven metres covers a 10
x 18 m room, with accuracy better than 25 cm.


4.4.3 Ultrasonic 3D Position Estimation Using a Single Base Station

In the previous section we saw that reducing the amount of infrastructure is a way
to reduce costs. A novel experiment is described in [60, 61], where only one base
station is needed to determine the position of objects in a room using ultrasound.
In a box-shaped, empty room with LOS conditions, accuracies were usually better
than 20 centimetres. However, in a non-empty room and/or in a case of no LOS,
the accuracy degrades to 2.5–3 metres 95% of the time.
The idea behind the method is to use reflections from walls, floor and ceiling as
virtual sources of ultrasonic signals into the room instead of real ones in the form of
transmitting base stations. An ultrasonic signal consists of amplitude peaks caused
by acoustic reflections, and makes up a pattern that depends on the receiver position
and orientation. This pattern is called a signature, and it can be predicted by an
acoustic room model. Position determination is done by a method called signature
matching, where the signature for many given positions are first predicted. Then
any measured signature in the mobile device can be compared to the predicted
signatures to find the one with the closest match. The approach is similar to that
4.5. SUMMARY                                                                     55

of RADAR, in that it uses scene analysis that requires preparations to be done in
advance to build the data set measurements are to be compared with. If this method
could be done with nearly automatically preparations and realistic environments in
the future, it could be a very attractive solution.
In addition to the acoustic reflections method described above, an experiment is
conducted which uses an array of ultrasonic transducers at the base station. This
makes it possible to determine the direction of arrival of received signals, or to
steer transmitted signals in certain directions. Then TDOA measurements can be
used to compute positions. In a non-empty room with LOS the accuracy with this
approach was below 1.4 metres 95%, degrading to 3.2 metres when no LOS.
It should be noted that the experiments conducted so far have shown many chal-
lenges that have to be solved before these approaches can be used in real-life envi-
ronments, but such solutions may prove suitable for special applications.


4.5 Summary

In this chapter, we have reviewed a total of 17 existing location systems. Four
systems are based on infrared technology, eight are based on different radio tech-
nologies, and five are based on ultrasound. In addition to using different wireless
technologies, these systems show how the different positioning techniques and de-
signs described in chapter 2 can be used. Thus, we should by now have a good
understanding of how positioning and location systems work, and their challenges.
We can now procede with the location based services at layer 3 in our reference
model, which builds on the positioning systems in layer 1 and the location systems
i layer 2. Location based services will thus be the focus of the next chapter.
56   CHAPTER 4. EXISTING INDOOR LOCATION SYSTEMS
Chapter 5

Location Based Services for
Indoor Exhibitions

This chapter will be about location based services (LBSs). These reside in layer 3
of our reference model, see figure 5.1. As stated in the introduction to chapter 1, a
location based service is based on knowing where something or somebody is. The
underlying layers provide the LBSs with such information.
There are two goals of this chapter. One is to come up with a description of “the
domain of indoor exhibitions”. The other is to come up with a requirements spec-
ification for “an LBS operating in this domain”. However, as we saw in the intro-
duction to chapter 1, a broad range of different LBSs exist. Likewise, an exhibition
could be everything from a museum or a gallery to a shopping mall or an indoor
zoo. If we were to take into consideration only generic issues with LBSs and ex-
hibitions, a lot of interesting problems and challenges might be left out. Thus, our
solution is to use a simulated case in this work, in which we can include as many
details as we want. The case consists of two parts, an LBS and a given physical
existing exhibition. The LBS we have chosen is a mobile electronic tour guide for
indoor exhibitions, and the exhibition is the Norwegian Astrup Fearnley Museum




     Figure 5.1: This chapter will review location based services on layer 3.

                                         57
58CHAPTER 5. LOCATION BASED SERVICES FOR INDOOR EXHIBITIONS

of Modern Art. The reason for calling the case “simulated” is that we have come up
with requirements ourselves—they are not coming from a real client. The reason
for this is the same as for not using a generic description. However, the selected
museum is real.
The result of this chapter is a requirements specification for our chosen LBS and a
description of the museum. These will be used in chapter 6, where we will analyse
the location systems from chapter 4 to see whether any of these are able to fulfil
the requirements.



5.1 Problem Area

Before we introduce our specific case, we will look at exhibitions and mobile elec-
tronic tour guides in general. First, based on what we have learned about challenges
with indoor positioning so far in this thesis, we will try to come up with a list of
characteristics of indoor exhibitions that may influence an indoor positioning sys-
tem. Then, we will learn about electronic tour guides. This is an important part of
this thesis, as it is what we will base our requirements specification on.


5.1.1 Characteristics of Indoor Exhibitions

In chapter 2 we learned how positioning can be done. In chapter 3 we learned
that wireless communication, and thus positioning, in indoor environments is chal-
lenging, and in chapter 4 we saw how different positioning systems have been
implemented. Based on this learning, we have come up with a list of characteris-
tics below that should be taken into consideration when working with positioning
systems for indoor exhibitions:

    • Layout of the premises where the positioning system will be installed. This
      includes for example the number, size and shape of rooms, storeys and par-
      titioning walls.

    • Construction materials of walls, ceilings, floors, windows and so on.

    • Furniture, partitioning walls, etc. that the premises are fitted out with.

    • The placement and number of artefacts in the exhibition.

    • How often the exhibition is changed.

    • The number of visitors and how they are typically distributed around the
      exhibition, both physically and timewise.
5.1. PROBLEM AREA                                                                    59




Figure 5.2: Traditional museum guide using a megaphone so that everyone in the
group can hear him.


Actually, these characteristics could be valuable to look at for any indoor location
based computing system.



5.1.2 Mobile Electronic Tour Guides

Our LBS example will be a mobile electronic tour guide. We will define such a
guide as a mobile physical device that could replace a human guide in an exhibi-
tion. This means that it is possible to store information on the device or use the
device to retrieve information stored on a server over a communications medium.
In addition, the device has at least one output channel, so that the stored or retrieved
information can be revealed to its user. The information is supposed to guide the
visitor while he is at the exhibition. The main reason for replacing human guides
with electronic guides is that each visitor then can have his own personal guide.
This offers the visitor with much more freedom, because he can choose what he
would like to see, when he wants to see it, and for how long he wants to see it. Be-
cause the visitor only needs to focus on those parts of the exhibition he finds most
interesting, he can spend more time at these and thus get more in-depth information
about them.
In the definition provided above it was stated that the electronic guide could replace
a human guide. It should be mentioned here that the electronic guide also could
replace any other means of guiding in an exhibition, like posters with text, illus-
trations or pictures, touch screens, static mounted head-phones and so on. The big
advantage with the mobile, personal electronic guide over such static guiding tools
is that the visitor will avoid spending time in queues for access to the additional
information.
As we have now seen, electronic guides can serve as substitutes for human guides
60CHAPTER 5. LOCATION BASED SERVICES FOR INDOOR EXHIBITIONS

and static guiding tools for their users. The first such guides appeared in the 1950s
and 60s, and the devices used were portable reel-to-reel players and cassette play-
ers. They allowed the users to listen to pre-recorded information about the dif-
ferent artefacts in their own pace, without having to follow a human guide in a
group. While audio-only guides still are much in use today, in more modern forms
such as MP3-players for example, a new generation of guides has arrived with the
development of the hand-held computers, especially the personal digital assistants
(PDAs). These devices are able to provide the user with full multimedia content,
that is information in the form of text, sound, images and video.
The development of new technology and increasing research interest in the field of
enhancing exhibition experiences have led to a broad range of suggestions to what
a modern electronic tour guide should be able to provide. A summary is given
below, where the suggestions are divided into four groups which differ in type of
use of the tour guide.


Enhance the visitor experience The most basic idea of enhancing the user ex-
    perience in an exhibition is to provide the user with additional information
    about the different artefacts he is watching. For example, a visitor that stands
    in front of a painting can be provided with information about the work itself,
    the painter, the artistic style of the era, and so on.

Ease the visitor experience A tour guide implemented on a mobile device with a
      screen can provide the user with a map of the premises. The map can be used
      for navigation, to guide the user along different pre-defined routes or a route
      generated automatically from the visitor’s preferences, or it can help clarify-
      ing where the user has already been. The map can also contain information
      about where the toilets, emergency exits, cafeteria and so on is situated. If
      the user comes to the exhibition as part of a group, he could see where the
      others are on the map. The map could also report about congestions and
      queues so that the visitor could avoid these.

Management tool Many tour guides have the ability to record the visitor’s actions
    while at the exhibition, like the order in which he watched the different arte-
    facts, which ways he walked between them, how much time he spent at the
    objects, and what information he requested on the device. The exhibition
    owners can use this information to make statistical data about the behaviour
    of the visitors, which can be analysed and used to improve the system. For
    example, the visitors’ navigation patterns may reveal congestion spots within
    the museum that the management could solve by re-organising the exhibi-
    tion. In a real-time system the management could even use such data to make
    quick decisions regarding employee allocation to sections where additional
    needs emerge.

Extending the museum experience to before and after the visit In addition to pro-
5.1. PROBLEM AREA                                                                   61

      vide the visitor with additional information while at the exhibition, the visitor
      could be offered to prepare his excursion at home. By logging on to the exhi-
      bition’s web site through the Internet, he could browse the different content
      of the exhibition and selecting those he is most interested in. Upon arrival at
      the exhibition at a later point, the visitor is provided with an electronic guide
      that can give a guided tour based on the visitor’s pre-selection.

      In those cases where the visitor either makes his own route in advance as
      mentioned above, and/or the system at the exhibition records the visitor’s
      actions while at the exhibition, it is easy to automatically generate a CD or
      personal web site for the visitor which contains information about all arte-
      facts he has shown an interest in during the visit. In this way the learning
      could be improved because it is easy for the visitor to go back and review all
      that he has seen.




Mobile Electronic Tour Guides and Positioning Systems


To be able to provide the services described in the previous section, a positioning
system is required. We saw that the most basic idea of enhancing the experience
from an exhibition visit is to let the guide provide the visitor with additional infor-
mation about the artefacts he is watching. For the guide to do this, it has to know
which artefact the visitor is currently watching. The simplest way to do this is to
mark each artefact with a number, and then let the visitor enter the number belong-
ing to the artefact in question on his device. The corresponding information is then
revealed on the device [62].
There are two main reasons that this very simple and low-cost solution will not
hold in many tour guide applications. First, this solution will not provide navi-
gation support, and second, the user will have to take an active part. Whether the
users should be actively involved in the positioning process, or whether they should
remain passive, is a very important issue developers of LBSs have to consider, as
it put very different requirements on the underlying positioning system. An active
user has to perform some action for the system to do the positioning. For example,
the user can be equipped with a hand-held device. When the user sees an interest-
ing artefact, he can point his device at a sensor attached to the artefact, and by this
tell the system that he is present. He will then receive some information about this
artefact. On the other hand, a passive user does not have to perform any specific
action for the positioning to occur. He could wear a tag on his jacket that is auto-
matically positioned by a surrounding infrastructure without the user being aware
of it. In general, providing positioning capability to systems with passive users is
much more challenging than to systems with active users.

Existing Location Based Tour Guides

We will now look at examples of how positioning technology has already been
used in electronic tour guides. Only indoor systems are included.



Cyberguide The Cyberguide project [8] took place at Georgia Institute of Tech-
nology during a one year period in 1996/97. Project researchers and students devel-
oped prototypes of a location based tour guide that could support a visitor to one of
the labs during monthly open houses. The visitor was provided with a PDA1 with
a map of the lab, with symbols representing the different projects demonstrated at
different places in the lab. When the visitor clicks on a symbol, information about
the project is displayed on the screen. All information is stored on the PDA.
The positioning capability of Cyberguide was used to automatically scroll the map
so that the user and his immediate surroundings would always be in the picture.
Positioning information was based on proximity sensing, by having a special IR
receiver connected to the PDA listening for infrared signals (beacons) emitted from
TV remote control units hanging from the ceiling. Each unit made up a small
cell, and position was updated when the user moved into a new cell. Figure 5.3
illustrates this.

       Figure 5.4: Infrared transmitters in the fresco room in Torre Aquila.


Torre Aquila Torre Aquila is a tower at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy.
In this tower there is a room with a large fresco, which covers all four walls with
a total of eleven different panels (see figure). Researchers from The Trentino Cul-
tural Institute have developed a prototype of a multimedia museum guide, which is
supposed to enhance an audio presentation of the fresco by showing the visitor pic-
tures of the parts of the panel which is currently spoken of on a PDA [9]. The idea
is that this will make it easier for the visitor to identify details in large, complex
paintings while simultaneously listening to an audio commentary.
As in the Cyberguide project, an infrared based proximity technique is used for
positioning. IR transmitters are installed in front of each of the eleven panels, and
the PDA has an infrared receiver. When the system detects a visitor in front of a
panel, a picture of that panel is displayed on the PDA. If the user does not move,
the panel will be highlighted on the screen and the visitor can click on it to start a
presentation about the panel.
Pilot tests of the prototype, conducted in 2003, showed that most of the test users
pointed directly at the infrared transmitters with the PDA to speed up the position-
ing.


TaggedX TaggedX (Tagged Exhibition) is a location based museum guide project
that was implemented at the Natural History Museum of Aarhus in Denmark in
2003 and 2004 [10]. The museum has both a permanent exhibition and several
temporary exhibitions. The technical set-up of the TaggedX system is given in fig-
64CHAPTER 5. LOCATION BASED SERVICES FOR INDOOR EXHIBITIONS




                       Figure 5.5: TaggedX technical set-up


ure 5.5. The artefacts that the visitors are going to get additional information about
in this case are stuffed animals. These are tagged with passive RFID tags, and
each visitor PDA is equipped with a Compact Flash (CF) RFID reader by using an
extension sleeve. When the visitor moves his PDA within 3 cm of an animal, the
CF reader reads the unique ID and provides it to the PDA. The PDA then sends a
request to a central server using WLAN, asking for information that corresponds
to this ID. The information is retrieved from a database and sent back to the PDA.
The battery life of the PDA is two hours when constantly in use.



The MUSE Project The MUSE project [63, 64, 65] is an industrial research
project in the domain of cultural heritage and tourism. The first report on the
project was published in 2000, and articles on the evaluation of pilot tests were
published in 2004.
The MUSE project has developed a general framework for implementing context-
aware applications that can deliver multimedia content and services on several
different devices—from powerful, stationary computers with large wall-mounted
screens to mobile devices. For mobile use, a proprietary wearable terminal called
WHYRE has been built. This device plays the role as a personal context-aware
multimedia guide for use in museums and architectural sites. WHYRE can detect
position and orientation by several different sensors and WLAN. The sensors can
5.1. PROBLEM AREA                                                                    65

provide position, azimuth, roll, and pitch information, and there are also a digital
compass, two acceleroscopes, and a gyroscope included in WHYRE. In the pilot
tests, users’ approximate positions were detected by a positioning algorithm based
on signals received by WLAN access points. Orientation is tracked by a combina-
tion of inertial and geomagnetic sensors. The WHYRE device is very expensive,
and weighs nearly three pounds.



Nidaros The work with an electronic tour guide for visitors to Norway’s most
famous cathedral Nidaros, was published in 2004 [66]. These tour guides are
WLAN-equipped iPAQ PDAs, and positioning information is provided by the com-
mercially available Cordis RadioEye system described in section 4.3.1 on page 50.
This system claims that it is able to determine the position of all WLAN-equipped
devices in its range with an accuracy of up to 50 cm. However, in the tour guide
prototype, the RadioEye was found not to be accurate enough. The virtual zones
the cathedral was divided into were relatively small, and required an accuracy of
about 1 metre. Tests showed that this was not achieved.
The RadioEye was placed above an entrance, 15 metres above the floor. The accu-
racy is influenced by obstacles between the mobile device and the RadioEye, and
by the angle between them. Thus, the placement of RadioEyes is very important
to get maximum accuracy. However, with large angle and some obstructions, the
accuracy is still as good as about 2 metres.



Shared Mixed Reality in the Lighthouse The goal of this research (from 2003)
was to make a mixed reality system, where physical and digital users can share
a museum visit together in real time [?]. This is done by using a virtual reality
(VR) version of the museum. In this way, social experiences could be supported
at a distance, letting the visitors collaborate and discuss the exhibitions like if they
were at the museum together. Location awareness is a powerful resource for such
a shared experience, which in this project was produced using PDAs, an ultrasonic
tracking system, a 3D representation of the gallery, 2D maps, and mixed reality
exhibitions. Two other resources are a common audio channel through the use of
an Internet voice conference system and a common information space.
Awareness of the other users locations and orientations are used to indicate what
they are looking at and what they are doing. The physical users are equipped
with a PDA, which has a sensor package that is part of the ultrasonic location
system described in section 4.4.2 on page 54. The sensor package also includes an
electronic compass for orientation information. The location and orientation are
displayed on a map, along with the locations and orientations of the other visitors.
The VR user sees the other users as avatars on his screen.
66CHAPTER 5. LOCATION BASED SERVICES FOR INDOOR EXHIBITIONS

5.2 Case: The Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art

The Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo, Norway, is a private contem-
porary art museum that produces temporary exhibitions of international art [67]. It
was chosen because it is a popular museum, it is privately held by people with
money (which they may spend on new technology), and they have shown an in-
terest in electronic museum guiding. The museum has already implemented some
form of enhanced visiting by providing their visitors with additional information
about the artefacts. Their concept is called “Artists on the Mobile Phone”. The vis-
itor is given a list of number-artist pairs, and can call a telephone number with their
own mobile phone and then select a number code from the list. The audio content
varies between the artists themselves talking about their art works, and guides from
the museum talking about the art works. The cost of this service is NOK 30,-, in
addition to local rate. The customer is charged the cost via SMS and on receipt of
the SMS you may use the service repeatedly for two hours.


5.2.1 Detailed Description

Here follows a detailed description of the Astrup Fearnley museum. It tries to cover
the list of exhibition characteristics given in section 5.1.1 on page 58.
The Astrup Fearnley museum is part of a bigger building. It is about 2500m2, with
exhibition areas on two different floors. The distance from floor to ceiling varies
in the different halls, from 3.5 metres to 10.5 metres. Figure 5.2.1 on the next page
shows the layout and measures of the two floors. It should be noted that some
of the walls in the figure are temporary walls. Between each exhibition a joiner
comes in and takes down and builds up new walls so that the premises will fit the
requirements of the next exhibition.
The large curved wall is made of concrete. The stairs are steel with steps of oak.
The floor is Portugeese sandstone called Cascais Azul. There are a few windows,
but they are all covered with plastic blinds.
In 2005 the museum hosted three exhibitions between January 22 and December
11. The first and the second exhibition lasted for about four months each, while the
last exhibition lasted for two months. Between exhibitions the museum is closed
for visitors while the old exhibition is replaced by a new one. In 2005 this took
two and three weeks, respectively. Except these periods, the museum is open to the
public for free, six days a week.
In 2005 there were about 117 000 visitors to the museum. By using the information
above to make an estimate of how many days that year the museum was open we
get about 250 days. This means that there were an average of 468 visitors each
day, but there are typically more in the beginning of an exhibition. By using this

lower ground floor below. The gray areas are the exhibition areas. The white

68CHAPTER 5. LOCATION BASED SERVICES FOR INDOOR EXHIBITIONS

number and divide it by opening hours, which is six hours on average through the
week, there are approximately 78 visitors at any time in the museum. These are
normally evenly spread out.
Weekdays from 11am to 2pm there are guided tours for school classes, one at a
time and with a maximium of 30 students per class. There is also possible to order
guided tours at any time for groups of maximum 30 people.
Visitor numbers varies a lot from time to time, but the estimates can still give us an
idea of how crowded the museum is by taking some logical assumptions. The first
days of an exhibition it is very crowded, and there are less people at other times.
Weekdays have more groups than weekends etc.
I did my on-site research of the museum on December 7 og 9 2005 in the afternoon.
There were between 20 and 40 visitors in the museum at that time. The exhibition
I watched is called “Uncertain States of America - American Art in the 3rd Millen-
nium”. The exhibition consists of a variety of different kinds of artwork, which is
typical for a contemporary art exhibition (see also figure 5.7 on the facing page):

Paintings and pictures There were traditional paintings hanging on the walls, and
      there were canvases or panels in varying sizes leaning to the walls.
Stand-alone artefacts With stand-alone I mean artefacts, typically sculptures or
     models of any kind that is standing or lying on the floor. In this particular
     exhibition there were many artefacts on the floor. The size of these artefacts
     were typically about half the size of a human body or same size as a human
     body, but there were also a few very large installations.
Showcase artefacts This means that the artefact is placed inside a showcase of
    glass, which is typically placed on a pedestal.
Television and projector installations It is more and more common that the art-
      works are video or film. In these cases the installation consists of a television
      or projector and a screen, canvas or just the wall, and in some cases a coach
      or several chairs. One of the rooms were actually completely empty, with
      only a projector in one of the upper corners that made funny patterns on the
      floor and that was it.
      Because of the trend with increasing number of video installations, the mu-
      seum have to split the exhibition areas into several smaller rooms because it
      is supposed to be dark or quiet.


5.2.2 Museum Application Requirements

We will now establish a requirements specification for a mobile electronic tour
guide which is to be used by the Astrup Fearnley museum. What they want is
5.2. CASE: THE ASTRUP FEARNLEY MUSEUM OF MODERN ART             69




          Figure 5.7: Pictures from the case study exhibition
70CHAPTER 5. LOCATION BASED SERVICES FOR INDOOR EXHIBITIONS

an electronic guide that provides all the services and features described in the end
of section 5.1.2 on page 60. In this section these services and features are turned
into more formal requirements which will be used throughout the analysis which
follows in section 6.1 on page 77.



Functional Requirements

The functional requirements specify the services or functions of the system—what
the system must accomplish.


FR1 The electronic museum guide should present the user with multimedia content
    corresponding to the artefact(s) he is most likely to be interested in at any
    time.

FR2 The electronic museum guide should offer the user with a map of the museum.
    The map should be automatically updated to show the area in which the user
    currently is (e.g. which floor), and where in this area he is (e.g. which room).

FR3 The user should be able to get information about where in the museum his
    co-visitors and representatives from the staff are.

FR4 The management should be able to get information about where in the mu-
    seum visitors and staff are.

FR5 The system should record the user’s actions while in the museum.


This implies that the museum application will consist of at least six components:
a mobile hand-held device, a map, a positioning mechanism, rich multimedia con-
tent, databases for location information and multimedia content, and communica-
tion channels. The device used for the electronic guide and the communication
channels are described in more detail below, because these components impose
some important constraints on the system design. The positioning mechanism is
the most important component in our case, and will be further described in the next
section called non-functional requirements.
It should be noted that it is very important to address privacy issues in a system
like this, which is actually monitoring its users, both staff and visitors (refer to the
privacy discussion in section 2.2.2 on page 13). However, in most cases this can
be solved by explaining the person to be monitored the reasons for doing it, and
by providing him with the opportunity to switch the positioning mechanism off
whenever he wants to.
5.2. CASE: THE ASTRUP FEARNLEY MUSEUM OF MODERN ART                                 71

Device Requirements and Constraints To be able to show multimedia content,
the mobile end-user device needs a screen and an audio output channel. It should
also have some input channels, like buttons or a touch screen, and it must be easy to
carry around. The commercially available devices today that best suits these char-
acteristics, are the personal digital assistants (PDAs). The drawback with these
devices is that they have limited processing power and limited memory and battery
capacity. One of the implications from this is that most of the multimedia content
that the PDA should present have to be stored on a server, and that it must be de-
cided what data to store on the device, and what data to be streamed upon request.
Regular textual content could be stored on the PDA.
As mobile phone technology improves, these are promising for use as tour guides
instead of the PDAs. Mobile phone screens get larger, battery capacity improves,
and they are equipped with several means for communication. For example, the
Nokia N95 mobile phone has a large screen, GPS, WLAN, Bluetooth and IR. The
big advantage of using visitors’ own mobile phones as tour guides, is that the mu-
seum does not have to invest in user devices. The disadvantage is that mobile
phone screens will probably always be smaller than PDA screens, that visitor’s
have to dowload an application upon arrival at the museum, and the huge variety
of phones that would have to be supported. In the following, we use a PDA as the
user device in the Astrup Fearnley museum.
A tour guide prototype for mobile phones was made for the Nobel Peace Center
in Oslo, Norway, in 2005. In this prototype, a new means for positioning was
also developed, in cooperation with Radionor, the provider of the Cordis RadioEye
system described in this thesis. A new SIM card for mobile phones was developed,
so that the phone could be positioned using WLAN and Cordis RadioEye.


Communication The mobile device needs to communicate with a central system
for a lot of different reasons. It will request for content, its locally stored content
would need to be updated, messages may be sent between visitors and between the
visitor and staff or the central system. In addition, position information must be
exchanged between the device and the system. As we have seen in earlier chapters,
some communications systems such as WLAN can also be used for positioning.
An important issue regarding the underlying positioning system is thus whether
it should be coupled with the communication system or not. In the following,
we assume that a WLAN network is installed in the Astrup Fearnley museum for
communication purposes like those mentioned above.


Non-functional Requirements: The Positioning System Requirements

By reviewing the functional requirements in section 5.2.2 on the facing page, we
can see that they all depend on an underlying positioning system, which should
72CHAPTER 5. LOCATION BASED SERVICES FOR INDOOR EXHIBITIONS

               m
cover the 1800 2 of exhibition areas. The electronic museum guide application’s
requirements of this positioning system is given below. They are based on the
location system properties outlined in section 2.2.3 on page 14.
User involvement

PR1: The user should be passive.

This first requirement could equally well be called semi-passive or semi-active.
What it means is that the user should be told that his position relative to the dif-
ferent artefacts in the museum determines which artefacts the PDA automatically
will provide information about, but the user should not have to be required to per-
form certain actions for the positioning to occur. This means that the user will have
to walk about and be near the artefacts he is interested in information about, but
he should not have to walk very close to the artefact, point to it, read instructions
posters, etc.

Accuracy, precision, and update rate

PR2: The system should know in which room the visitor is at any time, with a con-
fidence level of 95%.

This requirement will cover functioanl requirements FR2-FR4. For FR2, the user
will be presented with a map of the building or a part of the building, and the room
the user is currently in will be highlighted. For the user this room-scale accuracy
is good enough, since there is no added value in knowing exactly where in a room
he is in this kind of application. He is most likely to see that for himself.
One advantage by room-scale accuracy is that the positioning update rate can be
lower than in a case with continous real-time tracking of a small dot representing
the user, thus potentially saving power or reducing the amount of infrastructure.
But, it is important that the system is designed so that it quickly detects when a
user enters a new room.
Since the system knows where a visitor is at any time, it knows where all visitors
are. By storing the positioning information about all visitors centrally, a user can
get information about other visitors he came to the museum with (as long as these
have agreed to it) upon request to the system (FR3). As response small symbols
for each co-visitor could be displayed in the different rooms on the map, and/or
the user could be presented with a list of name-room pairs textually. Information
about staff members can be stored in the same way, and the management could get
information about both visitors and staff (FR4).

PR3: The system should know which artefact the user is most likely to want ad-
ditional information about at any time, based on where he is. An accuracy of 2
5.2. CASE: THE ASTRUP FEARNLEY MUSEUM OF MODERN ART                              73

metres is sufficient.

This requirement is based on two assumptions. The first is that there is very un-
likely that there are so many artefacts within a radius of two metres from the user
that the PDA will show too many “hits” or miss out some “hits”. The second is
that 2 metres is the longest distance when the user still feels that he is “near” an
artefact.

Scale and scalability

PR4: The system should be able to handle 200 concurrent users, and crowds of up
to 40 users packed closely together.

PR5: The positioning system should scale well regarding both physical reach and
handling larger amounts of MOs.

Scalability is not very important in our particular case, but for the solution to be
used in other museums as well this is very important. It is also possible that the
museum will expand its exhibition areas in the future, and it is clever to be aware
if this would be a problem with the existing positioning system.

Deployment and integration

PR6: The system infrastructure should be easy to install and configure.

PR7: The system infrastructure should not disturb its users.

PR8: The system infrastructure should be easy to reconfigure with new exhibitions.

This includes both replacement of hardware components in the infrastructure and
reconfiguration of the system.

Power consuption

PR9: The user should be able to stay in the museum a whole day (six hours) without
having to worry about recharging any batteries.

PR10: The museum staff should spend a minimum of time and effort recharging or
replacing any batteries.

Cost

PR11: The costs should be as low as possible.

                        Figure 5.8: Requirements prioritised


Deciding Requirement Priority

To give priorities to the requirements is not an easy task. They are all important
to us, that is why they are chosen as our requirements. Still, some are more im-
portant than others, and it is important to clearify this before starting the analysis
work because it makes it possible to compare different solutions to each other in a
structured way.
The result of deciding requirement priority is given in figure 5.8. Below follow
some of the arguments for ending up with this result.
The top three requirements in figure 5.8 makes sure that the positioning system is
able to do what we want it to do. The fourth requirement ensures that the museum
could afford it. Requirements 5–7 says something about how much extra work is
put on the museum staff (or on hired extra personnel). They are internally ranged
as they are because number five represents continuos work, number six represents
a work process that will happen about four times a year (with each new exhibition),
and number seven will typically be a one time only happening.
Requirement number eight and nine are very important for the user experience.
However, together with requirement number ten it may be possible to adjust our
requirements only a little if these are not fullfilled. For example, if the battery on
the PDA only lasts for four hours and not the required six, the visitors could be
made aware of this and it would not be a big deal. It might be rare anyway that
a visitor spends the whole day in the museum. Or if the user device includes a
headset that is somewhat bulky, it is still likely that many of the visitors interesting
in using a PDA in the museum would not care about this. If the positioning system
does not manage to support as many as 200 concurrent users, the museum could
reduce this number by only providing PDAs to 100 visitors at a time. This is
actually not unlikely, because buying and managing 200 PDAs is maybe over the
5.3. SUMMARY                                                                        75

top for most museums.
The “least important” requirement is scalability. The reason for this is that scalabil-
ity is not necessary for an initial set-up of the system to work. One could say that
scalability has a big influence at the system from the start because the “effectivity”
of the infrastructure plays a big role—that is how much more space is covered or
how many new users can be supported by adding one piece of infrastructure. Al-
though this is true this is covered by other requirements here, such as how easy
the system is to install and whether the hardware costs are low (which both mean
more scalable infrastructure). However, scalability is important if the system is to
be expanded at a later time, and it often also say something about how well the
particular system would suit other buildings with different environments.


5.3 Summary

In this chapter, we have looked at a selected location based service, a mobile elec-
tronic tour guide, for use in indoor exhibitions. First, we gave a list of important
characteristics with indoor exhibitions. Then, we described electronic tour guides
in detail. This formed the basis for a requirements specification for our tour guide.
In addition, we gave a detailed description of a selected exhibition, a modern art
museum. In the next chapter, we will analyse location systems from chapter 4
against the requirements specification and museum description, to see if any of
these systems can be used to provide location information to our tour guide in a
sufficient way.

In the previous chapter, a requirements specification for the positioning system to
be used in the Astrup Fearnley museum was developed. In this chapter, a thorough
analysis of whether any of the already existing positioning solutions described in
chapter 4 or 5 will fulfil the museum’s needs, is performed. Each solution is re-
viewed in a structured manner in section 6.1. Then follows a discussion of findings
in section 6.2 on page 91. Finally, in section 6.3 on page 99, we will try to make
some important lessons learned in this thesis more general and easily available for
use by others. However, as will be shown, this is very challenging. Thus, we will
also propose a new architecture for future LBCSs, which can reduce the risk of
choosing a solution that does not work as intended.




6.1 Structured Analysis

The positioning system requirements PR1 to PR11 were sorted in prioritised order
in figure 5.8 on page 74. These requirements will be reviewed for most of the
systems from chapter 4 and chapter 5, and the results will be summarised in a table
like the one in figure 6.1 on the following page. The requirement with highest
priority is on the leftmost side, and the least important one is at the rightmost side.
If a requirement is marked with an “X”, it means that it is not fulfilled. If it is
marked with a “/”, it means that the requirement is only partly fulfilled. No mark
means that the requirement is fulfilled. The reason for doing it this way instead of
the opposite, with marks for requirements that are fulfilled, is that it makes the table
easier to read. What we are interested in are the requirements that are not fulfilled,
and this is made more explicit by marking only these and leave the others empty.
There are more requirements that are fulfilled than are not fulfilled. Systems that
are not analysed and the reasons for this are given in section 6.1.4 on page 90.

                Figure 6.1: Summary table for structured analysis


The analysis will start by reviewing existing location based tour guide systems de-
scribed in section 5.1.2 on page 62. This group of systems will be called Category
1 systems. It is natural to start with these systems, because they have been imple-
mented in the same domain as we are interested in. Then follow the Category 2
systems. These are similar to those in the first group, but used for other LBSs and
in other domains. The third group, the Category 3 systems, consists of the rest of
the systems described in chapter 4.
The analysis of a system will be based on a scenario where the system is to be
installed in the Astrup Fearnley museum, which was described in section 5.2.1 on
page 66. Assumptions are made when necessary, for example because information
on some aspects of a solution is not available. All requirements are reviewed,
but only those requiring explicit explanations are discussed in the text. A brief
conclusion of each system’s suitability for use is given, and a summary of the
whole analysis is shown in figure 6.4 on page 91.


6.1.1 Category 1 Systems

The Category 1 systems are the location systems used by the different tour guides
described in chapter 5. These are Cyberguide, Torre Aquila, TaggedX, Cordis
RadioEye (used in the Nidaros project) and Bristol (used in the Shared Mixed
Reality project).


Cyberguide

Cyberguide, described in section 5.1.2 on page 62, uses TV remote control units
hanging from the ceiling as infrastructure transmitters (beacons). The IR range of
such units vary, and can be as good as 5 metres. By using a unit with several LEDs,
a coverage area of 2 metres radius at waist height is possible.
6.1. STRUCTURED ANALYSIS                                                            79

In the original set-up, the Cyberguide system required special IR receivers con-
nected to the PDA. Today, there exist a lot of plug-in programs which can turn the
IrDA port on a mobile device into a receiver that can receive signals from remote
controls.
Room scale accuracy using Cyberguide technology is possible by placing beacons
just inside the entrance of all rooms. Because most rooms in the Astrup Fearnley
museum have more than one possible entrance, the number of such beacons would
be about 18 for the ground floor. To support 2 metre proximity sensing to artefacts,
beacons would also have to be placed above each artefact, or group of artefacts
if these are placed very close to each other relative to the coverage area of the
beacon. For the exhibition on display during our site survey in the museum, this
would mean adding 27 more beacons for the ground floor, making the total amount
of beacons 45.
It should be noted that in some cases it might be necessary to have several beacons
per artefact. For example, if an artefact is very large and wide and placed in the
middle of a room, it might be necessary to have beacons on several sides of the
artefact. If only one beacon is used and it is placed right above the artefact, the
range of it might not reach outside the artefact itself. If the beacon is placed on the
outer edge of the artefact it won’t cover visitors coming from all directions.
The prices of remote controls range from $10 to several hundred dollars, depending
on their functionality and IR hardware. A $40 remote with IR capabilities that
would cover our needs was found, but as all remotes it has a lot of functionality
and a housing with buttons that we don’t need for it to function as a Cyberguide
beacon. It would not be difficult to make simpler beacons at lower costs. However,
if $40 remotes are used, the total beacon costs would be $1800, which is not a very
high cost for a complete sensor infrastructure. With more research, it is also likely
that a cheaper remote that does the job could be found.
The Cyberguide beacons have to be ceiling mounted. Although no wires are
needed, it would be a time-consuming task to mount 45 beacons for one floor (and
the other floor is twice as large). In the two areas of the museum where the ceiling–
floor distance is above 7 and 10 metres, the beacons would have to be hanging from
the ceiling down to normal ceiling height due to limited range. One of the biggest
disadvantages with the Cyberguide system is that the cumbersome installation pro-
cess would have to be repeated with each new exhibition. Because the new artefacts
may be arranged in a completely different way, many or all of the beacons have to
be moved accordingly. One could think that it would be better to mount as many
beacons as is needed to cover the whole floor during the first installation, and just
map new artefacts to the appropriate beacons. Then it would not be necessary to
move any beacons. However, this would require a tremendous installation effort, a
huge amount of beacons and a more difficult beacon/artefact mapping process. The
challenging indoor environment is also likely to cause problems with non-intended
80                                                       CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

beacon signals reaching receivers which normally are outside their reach.
The biggest problem with using Cyberguide in the Astrup Fearnley museum would
be to change beacon batteries. For this to not be a problem, the batteries would
have to last for at least four months, because then they could be replaced while
remounting the beacons between two exhibitions. As the beacons continuously
emit their IDs at short time intervals, and because they have several LEDs and
provide relatively long range, batteries would need to be replaced too often.


Conclusion The disadvantages with the Cyberguide solution is that it would be
time-consuming and cumbersome to install, to reconfigure, and to maintain beacon
batteries.


Torre Aquila

The Torre Aquila system, described in section 5.1.2 on page 62, operates with
only 1 metre IR range. This means that our requirement of 2 metres proximity
sensing can not be fulfilled. It also means that the user would have to take an active
part for room scale positioning to occur, for example by pointing his device at a
special “Entering new room” transmitter by the room entrance. The reason for this
is that some of the openings between rooms are wider than 2 metres, so even if
transmitters were placed all around the entrance, their signals may not reach the
receiver at the PDA.
If we were to use the Torre Aquila system although it does not support 2 metres
accuracy, a new problem may arise. Because of the limited range, the visitors
would have to get very close to an artefact for positioning to occur. The result
could be queues at the most popular artefacts. The Torre Aquila system would
also be cumbersome to install, as the transmitters are wired, and one transmitter is
needed for every artefact.


Conclusion The biggest problem with the Torre Aquila solution is that the range
is too limited. 2 metres proximity sensing can not be achieved, and room scale
accuracy would require an active user. This makes Torre Aquila a bad candidate
for use in the Astrup Fearnley museum.


TaggedX and Passive RFID in General

The TaggedX system, described in section 5.1.2 on page 63, could not be used in
the Astrup Fearnley museum because the tag/reader range is only a few centime-
tres. As in the Torre Aquila case, limited range violates the requirements for 2
6.1. STRUCTURED ANALYSIS                                                         81

metres proximity sensing and a passive user. Room scale accuracy is difficult, and
queueing problems are likely to occur. The user would have to be very active—
walking really close to the artefacts, and then hold his PDA next to the artefact’s
tag. This solution could be replaced by a much simpler and cheaper solution, where
the user enters given numbers for the artefacts he is interested in.
As just described, the TaggedX solution violates our three most important require-
ments due to its limited range. However, it does fulfil all the other requirements.
Thus, it is interesting to look closer at passive RFID in general, to see how it
can solve all these other requirements. RFID technology was described in sec-
tion 3.3.3 on page 35.
When a new exhibition is about to be set up, a lot of new artefacts arrive at the
museum. Before each artefact is placed in its proper location in the exhibition
areas, a member of the staff could attach a passive RFID tag to it. The tag’s ID is
read with a hand-held reader and stored in a database, together with an artefact-ID
and a room-ID. This work does not add much time or effort to the regular working
process. The advantages with using passive RFID tags are that they are cheap,
and they do not need their own power source. No battery maintaining or wiring is
necessary.
The museum visitors are equipped with PDAs with RFID-readers. When a reader
comes within range of an artefact-tag as the visitor walks about in the museum, it
reads the artefact-ID and transmits it to a central server through WLAN. The central
server looks up the tag-ID in the database, and finds out which artefact the user is
close to and sends the correct content to the PDA through WLAN. It also checks
on the room-ID, and if this is different from the last reading it sends an updated
map to the PDA. Depending on how much storage capacity the PDA has, some of
this work may happen on the PDA without needing data from the central server.
For example, information about the most popular artefacts could be pre-stored on
the PDA, together with these artefacts’ IDs. When the RFID reader detects these
IDs, it can show the right content without contacting the central server.
In some exhibitions the distribution of artefacts might be scarce. In this case, we
propose to introduce tags which we will call tracking tags. These are similar to the
artefact tags, except they are not associated with an artefact-ID, only a room-ID.
These tags can be placed where appropriate, for example just inside room entrances
where artefacts are placed far into the room. During set up, after all artefacts of
an exhibition is placed around the areas, a staff member could take a walk through
the museum and look for places where tracking-tags are needed. In this way the
visitor will always have an updated map.
We will now look at the possibility for having a passive RFID solution with better
range, preferably about 2 metres. The problem is that current RFID-readers that
are small enough to be used in combination with a PDA, for example readers with
a Compact Flash (CF) or Secure Digital (SD) interface, have very low range, max-
82                                                      CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS




                  Figure 6.2: Examples of RFID SD/CF readers




                    Figure 6.3: Examples of RFID reader costs


imum 10 cm (see figure 6.2). This means that the users will have to be very active
and move close to the tags for reading to occur. This will be very disturbing for the
user, and it may also cause congestions at popular artefacts because all the users
have to walk very close up to it for reading to occur, before they can get informa-
tion about it. Furthermore, figure 6.3 shows that RFID readers get very expensive
with increasing range. For use in a proximity solution as we have described, we
would need a range of about 2 metres. This will give a reader cost of $3000, which
is very expensive (prices from spring 2006).


Conclusion TaggedX or other passive RFID solutions would be easier to install
than the Torre Aquila solution, as the infrastructure RFID tags are wireless. Except
for this, it faces the same problems as the Torre Aquila solution, as the tag/reader
range is very limited. The cost of readers that could give longer range is very high.
However, technology is always improving and prices are likely to drop, so passive
RFID may be a very promising solution in the future.


The Cordis RadioEye

The Cordis RadioEye (CRE) system used in the Nidaros project requires line of
sight for accurate positioning (see section 5.1.2 on page 65). This means that we
would need one RadioEye in every room in the Astrup Fearnley museum, eight
on the ground floor and nine at the lower ground floor. Since the PDAs used by
visitors, management and staff can have built-in WLAN support, no additional
hardware is needed at the client side.
With CRE, there are no extra hardware that draws battery power from the PDA.
6.1. STRUCTURED ANALYSIS                                                          83

However, the WLAN connection is always on, and this draws much power. With
todays technology, the PDA battery would not last for the required six hours.
The accuracy of the CRE system is typically 1–2 metres or better. This suits our
proximity requirement of 2 metres very well. It was reported in the Nidaros project
that such accuracy was not achieved, but the reason for this is probably that the
RadioEye was placed 15 metres above the floor at one side of a room. In the Astrup
Fearnley museum, the RadioEye would be placed in the middle of the room at
heights of about 3, 4, 7 and 10 metres, and the rooms are smaller than the cathedral
gallery. This should provide much better coverage and accuracy.
The RadioEyes have to be mounted in the ceiling and connected to a power out-
let, and then they have to be configured. After this initial installation, the system
does not have to be reconfigured, unless a new room is set up. In this case a new
RadioEye would have to be installed.
The CRE system is a commercial product, and the cost of each RadioEye is almost
$8000. The Astrup Fearnley museum would need 17 RadioEyes to cover all rooms,
making the total sensor infrastructure costs $136000. The CRE system will thus be
a much more cost-effective solution in buildings with larger and fewer rooms than
in our case.


Conclusion Because one RadioEye is needed in every room, and the Astrup
Fearnley museum consists of many rooms, the CRE solution will be expensive.
Otherwise, it fulfils most of our requirements.


The Bristol US Positioning System

The Bristol positioning system was used in the Shared Mixed Reality project de-
scribed in section 5.1.2 on page 65. To implement this system in the Astrup Fearn-
ley museum, four networked ultrasonic transmitters would have to be mounted in
the ceiling in every room. An RF transmitter in each room is also required. A
special receiver would have to be connected to each PDA. Preferably, it should be
placed on the users’ head or shoulder, since line of sight is required.
At the ground floor, there are five rooms that could be covered with a four US trans-
mitters configuration. The largest room would probably need at least ten transmit-
ters to be covered. In the two smallest rooms there might be only one transmitter
to detect the presence of a person in the room. The total amount of US transmit-
ters needed is thus 32, on the ground floor only. In addition, there are the radio
transmitters, and they all have to be connected with wires.
Bristol positioning hardware could be made for about $150 per room. In our case
the total hardware costs for the ground floor would be about $1050, which is af-
84                                                       CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

fordable. Costs of wiring and receiver costs must be added.
The Bristol positioning system requires line of sight for accurate measurements to
occur. Thus, the receiver should be placed on the visitors’ head or shoulder.



Conclusion The main disadvantage with the Bristol positioning system is that it
is very cumbersome to install.



6.1.2 Category 2 Systems

The category 1 systems that have been analysed this far are all used for positioning
in electronic tour guides. Now, we will analyse positioning systems that are similar
to these, but implemented in other domains.



Locust Swarm

The Locust Swarm system, described in section 4.2.2 on page 48, is very similar
to the Cyberguide system. Wireless IR transmitters called Locusts broadcast their
IDs, for receivers at the user devices to listen to. A Locust can cover an area of
6 metres in diameter, depending on the distance above the floor. By reducing the
signal strength, the coverage area can be reduced. The system description and
analysis are almost identical to that of the Cyberguide system, and will not be
repeated.
The difference between the Cyberguide and the Locust Swarm systems is that the
latter tries to solve the problem of changing batteries in the infrastructure nodes by
equipping them with solar cells and place them in fluorescent lamps. In the Astrup
Fearnley museum, there are three problems with this solution. The first is that this
place restrictions on where Locusts can be placed, because there has to be a lamp
there. The second is that it is not unusual that some of the exhibition rooms are kept
dark, for example when showing light installations or video presentations. The last
problem is the places where the ceiling–floor distance is very high. The Locusts’
range would then be too short to reach down to the mobile devices.



Conclusion The Locust Swarm system is very similar to the Cyberguide system
and has the same disadvantages. It suggests to use solar cells instead of batteries
at the infrastructure nodes, but in the Astrup Fearnley museum, most nodes will
still require batteries.
6.1. STRUCTURED ANALYSIS                                                         85

IRIS-LPS

For using the IRIS system, described in section 4.2.3 on page 48, a stereo camera
would have to be mounted in each room. If the room is larger than 15 x 9 metres,
an additional camera would be needed. In the Astrup Fearnley museum, this would
result in 9 cameras at the ground floor.
The visitors will have to wear headsets, with a transmitting IR tag made of 4 LEDs
and a battery mounted on top of it. A LED with a transmitting angle of 20 degrees
had a range of more than 10 metres. By choosing LEDs with wider angles and
shorter range, we can get the range and coverage area we need. A tag battery
supporting 4 LEDs can last for a minimum of six hours.
The first problem with IRIS is that it is cumbersome to install. Cameras have to
be mounted in every room, and they have to be connected with a central computer.
The second problem is that the headsets will be somewhat bulky, so a proper design
is important.


Conclusion The IRIS system may be a little cumbersome to install, and it requires
a bulky headset.


Active RFID

Passive RFID was discussed in 6.1.1 on page 80. Its biggest advantages are that the
tags do not need their own power source, and their low cost. In the case of active
RFID (described in section 3.3.3 on page 35), the tags are much more expensive,
they will need their own power source and the readers are at least as expensive as
those in figure 6.3 on page 82. Thus, we will not analyse this approach any further.


Conclusion By using active RFID we will solve the passive RFID range problem,
but at the cost of much more expensive tags that need their own power source, and
still very high reader costs. Active RFID is thus not a good solution at this time.


BILS

BILS, described in section 4.3.2 on page 52, is similar to the Bristol system. The
main difference is that it uses Bluetooth instead of ultrasound and radio waves.
Four Bluetooth base stations with additional special hardware are required in every
room. The Bluetooth range is 10 metres, so the biggest room at ground level in
the Astrup Fearnley museum would require more than four base stations. The total
amount of base stations would be about 36, only at the ground level.
86                                                      CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

Each base station has to be placed in a fixed known location, because its coordi-
nates are used in the position calculation. They must also be connected to a host
computer, which performs the position calculations. As BILS requires line of sight,
the base stations should be placed in the upper corners of a room.
The Bluetooth module on the mobile device will draw much power from the PDA.


Conclusion BILS would be cumbersome to install in the Astrup Fearnley mu-
seum. It also has a strict line of sight requirement, and the use of Bluetooth will
draw much power from the mobile device.


PAL650 (UWB)

The PAL650 system (see section 4.3.3 on page 52) is similar to Bristol and BILS,
as it needs four receivers, or actually three receivers and a reference tag, in fixed
known positions. But the range is six times longer than with BILS, so it is better at
covering large rooms. This means that less infrastructure is needed. One advantage
of PAL650 over BILS, is that the museum visitors wear tags that are only logically
connected to the PDA. Thus, it does not draw power from the PDA. The lifetime
of a tag battery is as long as four years. The other advantage with PAL650 is that
it does not require line of sight.


Conclusion The disadvantage of the PAL650 system is that it is cumbersome to
install, like Bristol and BILS.


Active Bat

The Active Bat system from section 4.1.2 on page 43, is tested with 750 receivers
                           m
covering an area of 1000 2 . In the Astrup Fearnley museum, this would mean
that about 1350 receivers would be needed to cover the exhibition areas on the two
floors. All the 1350 receivers have to be mounted in the ceiling in known fixed
locations. This would be a tremendous work, and makes the Active Bat system
a bad candidate for the Astrup Fearnley museum—and any other indoor location
based computing system covering several large rooms. The only case where this
huge installation effort could be defended, is when centimetre accuracy is required
in a limited area.


Conclusion The tremendous effort of installing the infrastructure makes Active
Bat a bad candidate for all location based computing systems spanning large areas
or several rooms.
6.1. STRUCTURED ANALYSIS                                                            87

Cricket

Cricket was described in section 4.1.3 on page 44. The ultrasonic range of the
Cricket beacons decide how many such beacons are required in an area. The range
is 10.5 metres when there is line of sight, but this is not always the case. Thus, an
assumption is made that the range is minimum 5 metres in the worst case scenario.
By having nine beacons in each of the similar sized rooms at the ground floor in
the museum, and some more and some less in the much bigger and smaller rooms,
the total amount of beacons at this floor will be about 84. The amount of beacons
that make up the Cricket infrastructure is high, but they are completely wireless,
and thus much easier to install than wired sensors. However, they are dependent
on their own power source, so battery maintaining might be a burden. Another
major problem is that the beacons need to be configured with their exact position.
This may be solved by auto beacon configuration algorithms in the near future, but
the power problem will still exist. The Cricket listeners are attached to the PDAs
through the CF slot, and draw power from the PDA.


Conclusion The Cricket solution is not suitable for the Astrup Fearnley museum.
The large amount of beacons require a very good auto configuration algorithm and
a better battery solution first.


6.1.3 Category 3 Systems

In this category, we find the rest of the systems described in this thesis that are not
belonging to category 1 or category 2.


Active Badge

The Active Badge system (see section 4.1.1 on page 42) could be used for room
scale accuracy only, or it could also be used for small scale proximity sensing by
using a hybrid IR/radio scheme. For the room scale only solution, one networked
IR sensor would be mounted in each room. 8 sensors would thus be required at the
ground floor. The visitors wear badges which transmit IDs that are associated with
their PDAs. The central server gets information about where everybody is, and can
send the proper information to the different PDAs. In the hybrid scheme, there are
radios placed at each artefact in addition to the infrared sensor network. The radio
transmitters could be wired for power, or they could use batteries. Their range can
be adjusted with power.
If our goal is room scale accuracy only, the Active Badge system is a good can-
didate. Its only disadvantage is that the sensors have to be wired, so that some
88                                                      CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

work has to be done during installation. But, in our case only one sensor would be
required in each room, so this should not be too difficult.
In the hybrid scheme the two different cases have different problems. If the radios
are power-adjusted to about 2 metres range, their batteries would have to be re-
placed pretty often. If the radios are wired, installation and reconfiguration would
be cumbersome, and the wires may be disturbing. For example, in cases where the
artefact is placed in the middle of a room, the wire would have to cross the floor or
be hanging from the ceiling.


Conclusion The original Active Badge system is a good solution for providing
room scale accuracy, but it does not support 2 metres proximity. A hybrid scheme
with radios can be used to solve this problem, but then other problems arise. Wired
radios cause a lot of problems, and are thus not interesting. Wireless radios impose
a problem of changing their batteries.


BIPS

BIPS (see section 4.3.2 on page 51) is very similar to the original Active Badge
system, and could be used in the same way. The only difference is that instead
of using diffuse infrared, the sensors use Bluetooth. This means that the sensors’
range is 10 metres, and that there are some problems with handling many users
because of the slow device discovery process. Thus, the Active Badge would be
a better choice if room scale accuracy is the only goal. In our case, however, we
would have to place wireless sensors at all artefacts for reaching 2 metres prox-
imity. Because of their range, power consumption and device discovery problems,
using Bluetooth in this way would not be a good choice.


Conclusion BIPS is similar to the original room-scale Active badge system. It
is not suitable for 2 metres proximity sensing, due to the Bluetooth characteristics
such as power consumption and slow device discovery.


RADAR

RADAR (see section 4.1.4 on page 46) has been deployed in an area of 980 square
metres with over 50 rooms, covered by three base stations. This means that three
                                                         m
base stations are enough to cover the ground floor (600 2 ) of the Astrup Fearnley
museum, and that three or four base stations are enough to cover the lower ground
            m
floor (1200 2 ). The PDAs are equipped with WLAN, so no other hardware is
needed.
6.1. STRUCTURED ANALYSIS                                                           89

A radio map must be built to map measured signal strengths to position coordinates.
Using the radio propagation model, only 4.3 metres accuracy was achieved. Thus,
we would have to use the empirical approach, which provides accuracy of 2-3
metres 50% of the time. Constructing the radio map takes time, and the museum
would need help from experts to do it. For better accuracy, maps for different
situations should be made, and all these maps would have to be made again with
each new exhibition introducing larger changes. Thus, although the hardware costs
are very low, the configuration process will cost both time and money.
More and more buildings are equipped with WLAN today. If this is already in
place, no additional hardware would be necessary, or the only thing required is to
add a base station or two, or to place the base stations in other locations. However,
existing WLANs may be more usual in office buildings, learning institutions and
cafes than in museums. Still, installing three WLAN base stations is not very
difficult or time-consuming, and the prices are very low.


Conclusion The accuracy/precision combination of RADAR is not sufficient for
our tour guide, and the radio map construction process(es) would have been both
time-consuming and expensive.


Ekahau

Ekahau (see section 4.3.1 on page 49) is very similar to RADAR, in that it uses
(existing) WLAN infrastructure for positioning. Accuracy of 1 metre is possible
by using 5–7 access points, and the probabilistic approach reduces the time needed
                                                m
for site calibration to about 1 hour per 1200 2 . The site calibration of the As-
trup Fearnley museum would then take about 90 minutes only. The second big
advantage with Ekahau compared to RADAR, is that minor environment changes
do not require re-calibration of the positioning model. Partial re-calibration is only
required when base stations are moved, or heavy structures are modified.


Conclusion As with RADAR, constructing the positioning model in Ekahau takes
time, but much less time. A few more base stations are required, but these are low
cost and easy to install and provide better accuracy. Reconfiguration is also easier.
Ekahau is a commercially available software product, but experts are required to
do the walk through. The software and service costs may be high.


Hanover

The Hanover system is also similar to RADAR, but instead of using existing WLAN
infrastructure, it relies on an existing Bluetooth infrastructure. Because the Blue-
90                                                        CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

tooth range is much lower than the WLAN range, a minimum of three base stations
are necessary in every room. Another disadvantage with the Hanover over RADAR
is that using Bluetooth draws more power from the PDA.




Conclusion The Hanover system is most interesting in cases where a Bluetooth
network is already in place, or where there is no WLAN network.




6.1.4 Technologies or Systems Not Analysed

Some of the systems included in chapter 4 and 5 are not analysed further. The
reasons for this are given below.
The MUSE project (see section 5.1.2 on page 64) provides little detailed informa-
tion on the positioning solution used, except that it uses WLAN. This is alreday
covered by other systems.
The only difference between the analysed Active Badge system and the PARCTAB
system (see section 4.2.1 on page 47), is the use of a badge versus a special PDA.
Since this is the only major difference and we would like to use existing commer-
cially available PDAs, only the Active Badge system was analysed.
DOLPHIN (see section 4.4.1 on page 53) is currently only handling positioning of
static devices, and is thus not interesting to us. However, it should be noted that its
auto configuration algorithms may be used by Cricket and Active Bat systems in
the future.
The ultrasound system which requires only one base station (see section 4.4.3 on
page 54) is very interesting research, as it would be similar to the IRIS-LPS and the
Cordis RadioEye systems in that only one unit of positioning hardware is required
in each room. However, even though experiments show an accuracy of 2–3 metres,
this is in ideal situations in a lab, and not in a changing and dynamic environment
like a museum.
ZigBee technology was described in section 3.3.2 on page 33. In section 6.1.1 on
page 80, we analysed solutions based on passive RFID, and found that a proximity
solution with tagged artefacts is a very promising solution. However, limited range
makes it difficult to realise. It would be interesting to see if ZigBee technology
could be used instead of passive RFID in such a solution. However, this will need
a lot of testing, and is suggested as future work.
6.2. DISCUSSION                                                                       91




                          Figure 6.4: Summary of analysis


6.2 Discussion

The results of the analysis in the previous section are summarised in figure 6.4. At a
first glance, it is difficult to see if some systems prevail the others. In the following
subsections, we will thus try three different approaches which may help clarifying
the analysis results. In the first, we will try to simplify the table in figure 6.4 by
removing solutions that for some reason are clearly not candidates for use in the
Astrup Fearnley museum. We will then introduce a scheme for giving scores to the
different solutions. Based on these scores, the solutions can be rated.
In the second approach, we will alter the summary table by grouping the solutions
according to the positioning technique they are using. In the third approach, we
will also take into consideration the wireless technology that is used. The hope is
that this may reveal some general information that can help choosing a positioning
system, or give clues to future positioning system developers.
92                                                        CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

6.2.1 Simplifying and Rating the Analysis Results

Our first approach in trying to make it easier to extract useful information from
the analysis results, is to remove systems that are clearly not candidates for use in
the Astrup Fearnley museum. First, we remove the solutions which has an “X”
for one or more of the three leftmost columns (PR2, PR3, or PR1). As stated in
section 5.2.2 on page 74, these requirements ensure that the solution is able to do
what we want. Systems with an “X” here fail to do so. Thus, they are not interesting
to discuss any further, and can be left out so that the table gets easier to read. When
these systems are removed, the three columns can be removed altogether, as they
are now empty.
The fourth requirement from the left before we remove any columns is PR11—
Cost. Because this is a requirement with a lot of uncertainty, we will remove this
one also, but take it into consideration again in later discussions.
We then remove the rows with grey backgrounds. As we saw in the conclusion of
each of these systems during the analysis, their unfulfillment of at least one of the
requirements but the four leftmost is so severe that it eliminates the solution for use
in the Astrup Fearnley museum altogether.
To make it easier to sort the systems from “most suitable” to “least suitable”, we
will use a simple weighting scheme. There are seven requirements left, with the
most important one still on the leftmost side and the least important on the right-
most side. We start on the leftmost side and give this requirement weight seven,
the next requirement six and so on. Thus, if a requirement has an “/”, it is given a
score of it’s weight. If it has an “X”, it is given a score of it’s weight times 2, as
this is a more severe case. Finally, all the scores a system gets are summarised in a
total score. Low score means better suitability. The result of this process is given
in figure 6.5 on the next page, with the most suitable systems at the top and the
least suitable at the bottom.


Findings from Simplifying and Rating the Analysis Results

As we can see in figure 6.5 on the facing page, IRIS-LPS seems to be the best
choice for use in the Astrup Fearnley museum. It actually fulfills all our require-
ments to some extent. One or two cameras has to be mounted in each room, de-
pending on room size, but this work should not be too much to overcome. Users of
the museum guide will have to wear the transmitter tag in the form of a headset, but
this should not be a major problem as the same headset should be used for sound
and most users are used to this.
The Cordis RadioEye system is also a very good candidate, but it might be expen-
sive. This solution is very good for museums or other indoor environments with
6.2. DISCUSSION                                                                  93




         Figure 6.5: Revised and sorted summary table from the analysis


few and/or large rooms, because then only a small number of the relatively expen-
sive RadioEyes are needed. One solution for the Astrup Fearnley museum to keep
the costs down could be to install RadioEye’s in most rooms except the smallest.
Because very small rooms are likely to have fewer artefacts, it would be sufficient
to know that the user has entered a specific room. This could be inferred from
knowledge about the different RadioEyes’ placements and which RadioEye saw
the user last before he disappeared out of view.


6.2.2 Analysis Results vs Positioning Techniques

In chapter 2, the different positioning techniques triangulation, proximity sensing,
and scene analysis were described. The second approach to interpret the analysis
result in figure 6.5, is to group the systems according to the positioning technique
they are based upon. The hypothesis is that we will see some general differences.


Findings from Analysis Results vs Positioning Techniques

The first part of figure 6.6 on the following page shows the systems that are based
on the triangulation method. As we can clearly see, they are all able to do what we
want. Their main problem is that they are cumbersome to install and/or configure.
94                                                  CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS




     Figure 6.6: Summary table of triangulation and scene analysis systems




               Figure 6.7: Summary table of proximity systems
6.2. DISCUSSION                                                                     95

This is because their infrastructure is wired, and all except Cordis and IRIS need a
lot of infratructure installed in each room. But, once in place, they are doing a very
good job.
The scene analysis systems are given in figure 6.6 on the preceding page below the
triangulation systems. These systems take time to configure, and thus violate the
requirements for initial set-up, as do the triangulation systems. In addition, these
systems also take time to reconfigure if changes in room or artefact layout in a new
exhibition are substantial.
By comparing figure 6.6 on the facing page with the summary table for the prox-
imity systems in figure 6.7 on the preceding page, it is easy to notice that there
are much more diversity between the proximity systems. While using a proximity
solution can solve the installation/configuration hurdle faced by most triangulation
systems, it introduces other problems. For example, we can see that many prox-
imity systems fail to fulfill requirement PR10, which is typically not a problem
with triangulation systems. The main problem with proximity systems is that they
put very demanding requirements on the infrastructure nodes. To be able to ful-
fill all our requirements such nodes have to be small, lightweight, and low cost.
Their range should be 2 metres, they should use very little power, and handle many
simultaneous users. None of the solutions we have analysed have nodes with a
hardware/software combination to do all this. There are two main problems that
have to be overcome, cost and battery life, both on transmitter and receiver device.
We have now seen that triangulation systems seem to be better than proximity
systems and scene analysis systems. Their main problem is that installation and
configuration is cumbersome. The Astrup Fearnley museum consists of 18 rooms,
and equipping all of these with minimum four wired base stations in precise known
positions is a big task. But if the number of rooms had been smaller, this work
might be worthwile.
Having stated this, it would be interesting to look closer at the case with a proximity
solution when the number of rooms is high, like in the Astrup Fearnley museum.
We did already say that this could solve the initial set-up problems. What is the
main reason that current solutions will not work in Astrup Fearnley? The answer is
the high number of artefacts on display in the museum. If the number of artefacts
were smaller, more of our requirements would be fulfilled. For example, the job
with replacing batteries on infrastructure nodes (PR10) would be a smaller one.
The discussion above is summarised in figure 6.8 on page 97. The X-axis is the
number of rooms in the museum, and the Y-axis is the number of artefacts. We
have seen that the triangulation systems fulfill many of our requirements except
that they are difficult to install. This means that if the number of rooms is small
it could be worth doing the job. However, at some point (r) we reach a number of
rooms where it is no longer cost effective to use a triangulation method. Instead,
we could use a proximity solution with wireless infrastructure nodes, because there
96                                                         CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

is no wiring or other time-consuming installing involved. However, such a solution
typically performs worse with increasing number of artefacts, because they need
battery replacements.
“Many” rooms or artefacts is not a very accurate measurement. The values for          r
      a
and depend on many different factors, such as the the special premises, time,
                                                                       r
money available in the analysed case. A rule of thumb may be that is somewhere
                      a
between 5–10, and about 20, depending on battery life time of the infrastructure
nodes and number of staff to change the batteries.
The different solutions we have analysed are plotted in the figure. It shows that
several systems could be used if the museum had fewer rooms and fewer arte-
facts. We can also see that several systems can handle many artefacts or many
rooms. The Astrup Fearnley museum has both many rooms and a high number of
artefacts. This places it in the upper right quadrant. As we have seen earlier, the
IRIS-LPS system and the Cordis RadioEye system are the only systems that could
be used. However, if prices drop and battery technology improves, proximity solu-
tions based on passive or active RFID technology could also be used.


6.2.3 Analysis Results vs Positioning Techniques and Technology

We have now found the existing solutions that would be most suitable to use for
positioning in the Astrup Fearnley museum. We have also seen that the number of
rooms and the number of artefacts in a museum are important properties that in-
fluence the type of positioning system that should be chosen. We will now include
the technology used by the positioning system in the discussion, to see if this could
reveal some complementary information. Figure 6.9 on page 98 shows the new
extended table.


Findings from Analysis Results vs Positioning Techniques and Technology

There are mainly three findings from figure 6.9 on page 98.


     1. Few systems use the scene analysis positioning technique compared to trian-
        gulation and proximity sensing. The main reason is that for such a system to
        work well, a lot of work is required beforehand to build maps or databases.
        These also have to be continously updated.

     2. IR-based systems are typically proximity systems. The reason is the limited
        range of IR-signals, and the fact that they are so easily blocked. Although
        diffuse IR helps increase range, the signals are altered every time they hit
        something on their way and it is difficult to interpret the signals correctly at
6.2. DISCUSSION                                                              97

technology

        the receiver. A proximity solution does only need to detect a signal, it is not
        using it for further computation of position.

     3. Systems using triangulation for positioning are typically based on radio and/or
        ultrasound technology. As described above, IR-signals are too easily dis-
        torted and can not be used for the precision computing in triangulation. Thus,
        the more robust radio or ultrasound signals are used. As we have seen, many
        solutions use both to get even better accuracy.



6.2.4 Better Solutions with Sensor Fusion?

As we saw in section 2.3 on page 22, sensor fusion—using more than one sensor
system—could help improve a technology solution. Could we use a combination of
solutions we have analysed to get a solution that would fulfill all our requirements
better than IRIS-LPS or Cordis RadioEye? Unfortunately, when it comes to the
proximity systems none of them would be wise to combine, as the hardware and/or
cost constraints are not overcome by having more of what causes the problem.
The same is true for combining triangulation solutions. Combining a proximity
solution with a triangulation system or a scene analysis system is no good either,
as this will add the problem of installing/reconfiguring and by this removing this
potential advantage with a proximity system. Thus, sensor fusion will not help in
6.3. RESULTS AND SUGGESTIONS                                                     99

our case. The electronic museum guide application that our particular positioning
system is going to support, have too many conflicting requirements.



6.3 Results and Suggestions

While none of the systems we have analysed fulfil all our requirements, there are
two candidates that stick out. The best solution seems to be to use the IRIS-LPS
system. The second best solution would be Cordis RadioEye with no RadioEyes
in the smallest rooms. However, it is important to remember that while Cordis is
a commercially available system, IRIS-LPS is a research project only. Thus, all
hardware infrastructure and software have to made based on the prototypes from
the project. This means that choosing Cordis is a much easier and safer solution,
although more expensive.
We have seen that our electronic tour guide put many and conflicting requirements
on the underlying positioning system. Although we reached a result for our specific
LBS here, it would be valuable to extract important learning from the process and
use this to provide a generic tool which can be used by others that are to choose
a positioning system for supporting an indoor LBS. This will be the focus of the
next section.
Because it is so hard to choose positioning system, the consequences of making
a bad choice should be minimised, and it should be easy to switch to or add new
positioning technologies as they become available. Thus, we will propose a flexible
architecture for LBCSs based on the service oriented architecture (SOA) concept,
which can help realise this. This will be the focus of section 6.3.2 on page 102.


6.3.1 Decision Flow Diagram for Choosing Positioning System

Our work has shown that a thorough investigation of the domain the positioning
system is going to be a part of, is necessary. For example, we have seen that other
properties than those in our requirements specification were crucial, especially the
number of rooms and number of artefacts at the exhibition. The method we have
used to find a positioning system is summarised below:

   1. Perform a domain analysis and a specific analysis of client premises

   2. Decide functional requirements

   3. Decide non-functional requirements

   4. Prioritise the non-functional requirements
100                                                       CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS




                       Figure 6.10: Decision Flow Diagram

   5. Introduce some kind of weighting scheme for the requirements
   6. Perform a structured analysis of alternative solutions according to the re-
      quirements

While this method can be used, it is very specific and time-consuming. Thus, we
have tried to come up with a more general tool, which is able to give its user help in
the initial decision process of choosing a positioning system. This tool still requires
at least step 1 and 2 of the method above, maybe more, but by using the provided
tool before step 6, the number of solutions to analyse could be greatly reduced,
maybe down to two or three systems that all look promising. This will be a much
more practical method to use.
Figure 6.10 shows a decision flow diagram that could be used to decide which
kind of positioning system that would be most suitable in an indoor exhibition
domain when it comes to positioning technique. As we have seen, systems based on
different techniques often have some characteristics that make them advantageous
and some that make them disadavantageous in different cases.
The diagram is the result of many rounds of trial and error. It may not cover all
possible scenarios, but could still be a very useful tool to get a quick overview of
6.3. RESULTS AND SUGGESTIONS                                                       101

possible solutions and their advantages and drawbacks in given premises. It should
be noted that the diagram can be used in general, not only by tour guides that is
similar to the one we described in chapter 5. However, there are two requirements
that should be present: The user should be provided with information about the
artefact he is most likely to be interested in at any time, and the user should be
provided with a map showing where he is.
At the beginning of the decision process we have three possible outcomes: a trilat-
eration or triangulation based solution (TRI), a scene analysis based solution (SA),
or a proximity based solution (PROX). The first question to ask is whether the LBS
will suffice with room scale accuracy or not. If it does, a proximity solution would
be the best choice, as it could do with very limited infrastructure.
If better accuracy is required, we have found that the most important issue to con-
sider is wether there are “many” or “few” artefacts in the exhibition. As these
are subjective measures, we suggest to introduce an artefact threshold value called
A_THRESHOLD. This value has to be determined in each case, and is dependent
on the combined hardware/software costs of an artefact sensor used in a proxim-
ity solution with one sensor per artefact, and management and deployment time
of these, compared to available resources (for example manpower and budget). A
specification of this value is suggested for future work. If the number of artefacts
exceeds A_THRESHOLD, a proximity solution could be excluded as a candidate
solution.
To determine whether to use a TRI or a SA solution in a system with many artefacts,
we could ask if the exhibition is static or if there are regular exhibit changes (with
substantial changes so that reconfiguration is necessary). If the exhibit is mainly
static, an SA solution is preferred as this will in general require less infrastructure
than a TRI solution. However, if there are frequent changes a TRI solution is a bet-
ter choice. The initial set-up may be very time-consuming, but once in place it will
work regardless of changes in the exhibit. With an SA solution time-consuming
reconfiguration is required with each exhibit.
If the number of artefacts is below the A_THRESHOLD value, we are still left
with all three solutions. This is an easier case to solve. We then use the question
of static vs non-static exhibit changes again as we did above, to decide if SA is the
right solution or should be eliminated.
As we can see in the figure, there are two questions that can be asked initially after
decided that the system has few artefacts. If the system needs sub-metre accuracy
and the user is passive, the only possible solution is TRI. If the user can be active,
PROX is preferred.
If we have a system with few artefacts and frequent exhibition changes, the number
of rooms could help decide whether to use TRI or PROX. Again, we could use a
threshold value inferred from the actual case to decide the limit. The value depends
102                                                     CHAPTER 6. ANALYSIS

on the deployment time and costs for the TRI solution. If the number of rooms is
high (exceeds R_THRESHOLD), PROX is preferred. If the number of rooms is
below R_THRESHOLD, the required accuracy level can decide whether to use
PROX or TRI. If high accuracy is required, the requirement for an active user or
the lack of such a requirement finally settles whether to use PROX or TRI.
As with A_THRESHOLD, R_THRESHOLD, and maybe also a value for high vs
low accuracy, should be discussed further and are suggested for future work. Some
of the decisions here rely on a cost analysis, which is out of scope of this thesis.
Our work has mainly been concerned with technological aspects with regards to
LBCS requirements.


6.3.2 Applying Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) for Location Based
      Computing Systems

Many traditional Location Based Computing Systems (LBCS) are completely pro-
prietary. By this, we mean that their interfaces and interconnections between com-
ponents of the systems are closed and not accessible by other systems. The LBCSs
might have an internal layering and modularisation, but not one which can be ex-
ploited easily by other systems. We suggest that future LBCSs adapt a system wide
Service Oriented Architecture. This will be described in the following, after a brief
introduction to the SOA concept.


The SOA Concept

Service-orientation has become a very popular concept in recent years, and is used
in a broad variety of applications. A definition of Service Oriented Architecture
(SOA) is given in [68]:

      Service oriented architecture (SOA) is a paradigm for organising and
      utilising distributed capabilities that may be under the control of dif-
      ferent ownership domains.

Entities like people, organisations, and applications create capabilities to solve or
support problems and needs, and these can be used by other entities. A service in
SOA is the mechanism which enables access to one or more capabilities. This is
done through a pre-described service interface, which includes specific protocols,
commands and other means for supporting information exchange. For interaction
to occur, services must be visible to each other, which means that entities must be
made aware that the service exists. This is often effected by discovery mechanisms.
Interaction can then occur through exchange of messages, and the result is typically
a response to a request.
6.3. RESULTS AND SUGGESTIONS                                                      103




Figure 6.11: The main technologies of XML Web Services, which can be used to
realise a service oriented architecture.

XML Web Services technologies are commonly used to realise a SOA. This is
a set of standards and protocols based on XML, which covers the requirements
of a SOA. The main technologies of XML Web Services are SOAP1, WSDL2 , and
UDDI3 (see figure 6.11). Communication between services can be performed using
SOAP, a simple XML based protocol to let applications exchange information over
HTTP, or simply put, a protocol for accessing a Web Service. WSDL is an XML
based language for describing Web Services and how to access them. UDDI is a
directory service where entities can register and search for Web services, and is
used for service discovery purposes [69].


Architecture Proposal for Future LBCSs

Based on the three-layered model of an LBCS used throughout this thesis, includ-
ing a positioning layer, location layer, and an application (LBSs) layer, a SOA for
LBCSs is now introduced. The goal of this approach is to make it easy for differ-
ent systems to interact and collaborate. For example, it would be advantageous if
the lower layer positioning mechanism could be substituted for another one (see
figure 6.12 on the next page), without having to worry about the upper layers. This
could for example be due to LBS requirements changes. This way, a mobile device
which should be positioned could be provided with several means for positioning,
and the appropriate technology could be chosen based on the requirements spec-
ified by the application. Recent cellular phones can be positioned by either GPS
or GSM, and the Location API (JSR-179) defined by the Java Community Process
abstracts the details from the application developer by providing him with the same
interface for using both positioning technologies. However, this architecture is still
rather static, as it is not possible to add other positioning technologies than the
predefined ones.
An LBCS can be built according to the SOA concept by mapping each of the lay-
ers in our three-layered model into a service on their own, see figure 6.13 on the
                                                                          S

the SOA must also include a discovery-mechanism (represented by               D

ure). When a new positioning technology is introduced on the mobile device, for
example by equipping a PDA with an RFID reader, it will contact UDDI and reg-
ister itself. The location layer can then query the UDDI for the most appropriate
positioning technology according to requirements specified by the LBS.
Figure 6.14 on the next page shows how most LBCSs are implemented today,
with proprietary interfaces between all components on the mobile device side, pro-
prietary interfaces between the mobile device and the server system in the net-
work, and proprietary interfaces between the components on the server side. Fig-
ure 6.15 on page 106 shows how some LBCS architectures have been proposed
today, where parts of a SOA concept or just XML messaging have been used to
introduce flexibility between the mobile device and the components on the server
side in the system[10, 13, 70]. However, it is also possible to employ the SOA
concept for the entire architecture of an LBCS, see figure 6.16 on page 106. It is

between them defined through e.g. WSDL if the XML Web Services platform is
used. With this approach, the reorganisation of the services is simple (e.g. move
some functionality from the mobile device side to the server side if appropriate),
but more importantly, it makes it easy to attach new positioning technologies (layer
1) and deploy new services (layer 3). To add a new positioning technology on layer
1, the developer of the system only has to take the appropriate interface definition
into consideration (e.g. the WSDL), and generate skeleton code based on this. To
add a new service on layer 3, the developer of the service also only has to take the
appropriate interface definition into consideration, and generate client stubs based
on this.


Advantages and Challenges

In general, the main advantages of using the SOA concept in computing systems
are reuse and interoperability. Because service interfaces are open and the services
are published as available for use by others, they can easily be reused, either to
solve the same problems or needs, or in a completely new way not intended by the
service provider. Service providers can build on existing services without having
to start from scratch for each new system development.
Our proposed SOA architecture for future LBCSs has two specific advantages
based on the general advantages of using SOA. Different positioning systems could
be used by the same LBS for different purposes, and the same positioning solutions
could be used by several LBSs. New positioning systems and LBSs can be added
to the LBCS in runtime. In addition, our proposed architecture is able to support
all different architecture distributions, so that components of the architecture can

be placed where it is most appropriate with regards to the specific LBCS. For ex-
ample, in some LBCSs the layers from our reference model will be implemented
solely on the mobile device, while in others some layer components will be im-
plemented on the mobile device and some at the server side. Some systems may
even have most components at the server side, and only a thin client on the mobile
device.
The main challenge for our proposed system wide SOA to be successful, is that a
general agreement is reached with regards to a common semantics or ontology for
LBCSs, as standard XML Web Services do not consider the semantics of interfaces.


6.4 Summary

In this chapter we have applied all the knowledge gathered in the previous chap-
ters. First, we analysed a range of different location systems from chapter 4 against
a complex requirements specification made in chapter 5. We found that two solu-
tions, called IRIS-LPS and Cordis RadioEye, seemed to be able to cover our needs.
However, we realised that this specific result might not be very useful for others.
Thus, we tried to extract some general knowledge from the work with the thesis,
and turn it into a tool that more easily could be used by others. The result was a
decision flow diagram which may help emphasising important characteristics with
indoor positioning, and the choice of positioning solution. In addition, we also
proposed a new architecture for future LBCSs, based on the concept of Service
Oriented Architectures (SOA), which will ensure increased flexibility.

Conclusion

In this final chapter we will discuss how this thesis managed to answer the problem
statements given in section 1.1 on page 4. We will also summarise our contribu-
tions, and discuss limitations of the thesis and future work.


7.1 Achievements and Results

This thesis is trying to find the answer to the question “What kind of positioning
system would best fulfil the requirements of location based services used in in-
door exhibitions?” The first answer found is that this is highly dependent on three
things:

   1. The location based service that is to be supported by the positioning system.
   2. The premises in which the system is to be implemented.
   3. The exhibition(s) on display.

Thus, we suggest that thorough research and preparations are performed in these
areas before choosing a positioning system. Then, it would be valuable to make use
of a framework which could take specific parameters describing your LBS, your
premises and typical exhibitions as input, and give the best suitable positioning sys-
tem as output. However, as there are so many different and conflicting parameters,
this proved rather difficult. But, by going up one level, from the existing position-
ing system implementations to a categorisation of positioning techniques, a useful
decision flow diagram was made, which hopefully can guide future developers and
owners in the decision process.
The second answer to the problem statement is that because there is substantial
uncertainty about different positioning systems suitability as support for different

                                         109
110                                                   CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSION

LBSs, future LBCS should be built using a very flexible architecture that allows for
easy changes of positioning mechanisms. A selected positioning system might not
work as well as intended, or new positioning technology becomes available that
seems to be a better solution than the current. Thus, positioning solutions should
be developed according to a flexible LBCS architecture, which makes it easy to
substitute one positioning mechanism with another one, without having to replace
the entire LBCS, for example middleware, databases and services.
Although not directly, we will claim that the general problem statement is success-
fully answered. We can also see from the summarised list of contributions below
that the specific problem statements were successfully answered.

      • An overview of the field of positioning systems in general, and positioning
        techniques and technologies in particular.
      • A detailed description of the domain of indoor exhibitions and location based
        mobile electronic tour guides.
      • An overview and an extensive analysis of existing positioning systems against
        requirements from a complex tour guide.
      • A decision flow diagram which may help clarify consequences of choosing
        different positioning systems, and by this also help in this selection process.
      • Suggestion of a new flexible architecture for LBCSs based on a service ori-
        ented architecture (SOA) concept.


7.2 Critical review and Future Work

As there are so many different parameters to take into consideration when choos-
ing positioning system in an LBCS, it is not likely that our general decision flow
diagram covers all different scenarios. Thus, it is important that this tool is not
used as a rule for choosing type of positioning system, but as helping guidelines
to get a quick initial overview over different positioning system possibilities and
consequences of using them. Future work with the idea of such a decision flow
diagram could result in a more inclusive and powerful tool. It could be extended
to cover more parameters, be restructured in more effective ways, and maybe also
be used for both indoor and outdoor cases, regardless of domain. The threshold
values should be further examined.
With regards to the proposed system wide SOA architecture for future LBCSs, it
should be noted that this is very early work. A minimum set of methods a position-
ing system should support must be developed, and standardisation issues discussed.
Test implementation should be carried out, especially to see how well mobile de-
vices can handle the overhead (network and processing) introduced by existing
7.2. CRITICAL REVIEW AND FUTURE WORK                                          111

technologies for SOA realisation. However, future mobile devices will have even
better processing capacity than today, so this should not be a problem in the near
future.
