The location estimation results are visualized as demonstrated in
Figure 4. The images users took are uploaded in (a). Once the
images are uploaded to the server, the positions are estimated and
the results are plotted on the map in (b). When the users click the
images in (a) or the points in (b), the correspondent omnidirec-
tional or supplemental image are shown in (c). In addition, since
the image map database has both images and the location data, it
is also possible to virtually travel inside the museum as Google
street view. The control buttons are also shown in (c).                               (b) Correspondent points: 14 Confidence: 0.62

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The experiments were conducted in the Railway Museum, Japan.
The exhibition area is 155.2 m x 47.6 m as shown Figure 5. We
took the omnidirectional images (3500x950) at 2 m intervals (426
images) and took 1067 supplemental images (800x600). It took
three days to cover the whole area using a single capturing system.
The image matching was conducted using a Windows computer
                                                                                      (c) Correspondent points: 11 Confidence: 2.35
