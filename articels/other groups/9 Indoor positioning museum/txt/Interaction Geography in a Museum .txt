Abstract
This paper outlines our use of space-time visualization
as part of an emerging approach to studying human
interaction and mobility in interior spaces that we call
“interaction geography”. We describe how we have used
this approach in a museum setting. Findings and
discussion show how interaction geography draws from
space-time visualization research to advance
professional design practice in a museum. We conclude
by discussing limitations and the need for future
research to further develop this early work.

Introduction
This paper outlines our use of space-time visualization
as part of an emerging approach to studying human
interaction and mobility in interior spaces that we call
interaction geography. We describe how we have used
this approach in a museum setting using empirical data
collected during IRB approved research funded by the
National Science Foundation at a nationally renowned
museum located in the mid-South region of the United
States [33, 34, 35]. This data includes 1) 22 case
studies of complete museum visits that captured
continuous, multi-perspective audio/video records of
visitor mobility and interaction and 2) audio/video and
post-surveys from professional development and design
sessions with museum professionals.
We begin by reviewing relevant work in space-time
visualization research and museum studies. We then
illustrate how interaction geography and specifically, a
dynamic visualization environment we have developed
and call the Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS), draws
from space-time visualization research to describe
museum visitor’s interaction and mobility in museum
gallery spaces. Subsequently, we show how we have
used interaction geography and the Interaction
Geography Slicer (IGS) in one professional design and

development session with museum curators, educators,
archivists and designers. We conclude by discussing
limitations and the need for future research to further
develop this early work.

Relevant Work
Two bodies of research concerning space-time
visualization and museum studies inform this work. We
describe these in order.
Space-time visualization is an established area of
research and design [1, 2, 7, 9, 24]. Moreover, it is a
rapidly growing area of research due to new technologies
[10, 12, 18, 20], new forms of urban mobility [26, 27],
open data resources [13] and the increasing need to
gain insights and reveal patterns from complex data [2,
11, 25]. We draw from space-time visualization research
concerning time geography [15] and the use and
advancement of the space-time cube and space-time
cube operations such as space flattening [5, 21].
Moreover, we also draw from the visualization and
analysis of movement [3, 4, 6], the use of flow maps by
expert and non-expert audiences [27, 28, 31] and early
attempts to visualize movement and interaction in
interior environments [14, 17, 38].
With respect to museum studies, our work is informed
by two particular trends along with methods used in
museum studies. The first trend is that museums and
archival collections are redefining their mission, from
curating and conserving collections to engaging the
public in conversations about the meaning of archival
material in relation to broader societal themes [30]. The
second trend is that studies of visitor behavior are
shifting away from understanding gallery exhibits as a

fixed curriculum that visitors succeed or fail at
understanding, and towards a view of visitor learning as
an “enacted curriculum” [23]. Likewise, we draw from
methods of conversation, interaction and mobility
analysis used in museum studies [16, 18, 29, 36, 37] as
well as design based research methods that provide
empirically driven ways to build, test and refine designs
in educational settings [8].

Figure 2 is a snapshot from a dynamic visualization
environment we have developed and call the
Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS) to support multimodal analysis of interaction and mobility that moves
continuously through space and over time. The figure
shows the simultaneous movement and conversation of
a family of five whom we call the “Bluegrass Family” (a
mother, her two young sons, their sister and her
fiancé) in the museum gallery space shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2 shows how the IGS applies widely used techniques
of space-time visualization particularly concerning the
space-time cube [15, 21], space flattening [5] and the
visualization of movement [3, 4, 25] to study the sequential
and spatial organization of movement and conversation. For
instance, in the previous figure we highlight the efforts of a
6-year-old boy Blake (the blue movement path moving up
and down on the timeline display) to lead another family
member Adhir (the straight orange movement path on the
timeline display) on a tour of other exhibits in the gallery
space. We also note how their intertwined paths at minutes
5-6 indicate that Blake is finally successful.

interaction [32]. Lastly, Figure 3 below illustrates the kinds
of comparative analysis that can be explored using the IGS.
Namely, the figure compares the mobility of four different
families/groups including the Bluegrass Family in three
different museum gallery spaces. All displayed information is
set to the same spatial and temporal scales. The Taylor
Swift Family did not visit the Hall of Fame Rotunda Gallery
space and thus we substituted a floor plan of the entire
museum.

Figure 2 also hints at a larger set of possibilities to
dynamically use space-time visualization to study museum
visitor’s interaction and mobility made possible by the IGS.
For example, the figure provides some illustration of how
users can select and read conversation. The conversation
that is shown (e.g. selected by a user) in Figure 2 is a
conversation between Adhir and his fiancé Lily about the
painful life of Hank Williams that reveals why Adhir stood in
silent “reverence” for five minutes at Hank William’s exhibit.
We cannot devote adequate attention in this paper to the
full and still emerging possibilities of the IGS. However, it is
important to note that the IGS supports the visualization
and analysis of five streams of audio and video collected in
this example from small cameras worn by each member of
the family as part of this research. Moreover, the IGS
supports floor plan or map rotation, which allows users to
study whether interpretations in one floor plan view hold up
over changes in orientation and scale in other floor plan
views. Likewise, it supports multiple 3D space-time
visualization views. In addition, many of the decisions that
inform the design of the IGS aim to make space-time
visualization more useful to new audiences that are
particularly concerned with people’s conversation and

Using Interaction Geography to Advance
Professional Design Practice
Figure 4 below introduces our use of interaction geography
and the IGS during one professional design and
development session with museum professionals. Our
analysis of video records and post surveys from multiple
sessions in this museum including the one shown above
illustrates three primary contributions of methods (e.g. the
IGS) and concepts (e.g. “engagement contours” [33]) of
interaction geography.

Contribution 1: We found methods and concepts of
interaction geography allowed museum professionals to
“see” their visitors in very new ways and challenged
idealized models of museum visitors as relatively passive
consumers of intended design. For example, prior to our
work many museum curators, educators and designers at
this museum viewed young children’s rapid movements in
museum gallery spaces as childish behavior that
prevented real engagement and learning. The previous
figure captures the moment when they are vividly
confronted by Blake’s rapid movement (e.g. running back
and forth) to lead Adhir on a tour of other exhibits. Though
initially shocking, this moment created what we
understood as a shift in the perspective of museum
professionals to see young children’s rapid movements
and family’s “interaction geographies” as very intentional
and opportunities for design.

Contribution 2: We found methods and concepts of
interaction geography provide ways for museum
professionals to ask questions currently important to
museum studies and to ask new types of questions. For
example, in our design sessions museum professionals used
interaction geography as an approach to study how adults
coordinate young children’s attention and observation not
only at single exhibits as is typically the case [23, 30] but
also, at times, repeatedly across multiple exhibits and
gallery spaces. Moreover, we found interaction geography
offers ways to ask new questions such as how young
children manage their families as interpretive resources in
museum gallery spaces [33]. We feel these possibilities
advanced professional design practice in this museum.
Contribution 3: We found that methods and concepts of
interaction geography could provide a powerful means to
support evidence-based design decisions in this museum
and to do so collaboratively across multiple museum

departments. For example, museum professionals indicated
how this work could provide a much needed way to not only
learn about their visitors but also to gather evidence on
visitor activity that could inform future, more expansive and
equitable design decisions. Likewise, museum professionals
indicated that the visual and interactive nature of our work
could provide ways for different museum departments to
work together in new ways.

Conclusion & Future Work
This paper outlined our use of space-time visualization as
part of an emerging approach to studying human
interaction and mobility in interior spaces that we call
interaction geography. Many more studies are needed to
address inherent limitations in this early work, which
draws from one exploratory study. Future research should
further refine and generalize the visualization techniques,
software and concepts introduced in this paper across
different types of interior spaces and also conduct
additional user test cases to study how people understand
and use interaction geography and the IGS.
