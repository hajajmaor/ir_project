Abstract—Nowadays, there is a high demand for human
and/or objects monitoring/localizing in the context of applications
like Building Information Modeling (BIM), automated drone
missions, contextual visits of museum or sports monitoring for
instance. While for outdoor positioning accurate and robust
solutions (i.e. GPS) exist for many years, indoor positioning is
still very challenging. There is also a need of gesture/motion
tracking systems that could replace video solutions. We propose
in this paper a hardware/software platform named Zyggie that
combines both Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology and Received
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for low power accurate indoor
positioning and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) utilization
for motion tracking. Very few industrial/academic existing solutions can simultaneously perform indoor positioning and motion
tracking and none of them can do both under low power,
low cost and compacity constraints addressed by our platform.
As Zyggie has the capability to estimate distances w.r.t other
platforms in the environment and quaternions (which represents
the attitude/orientation) users can test/enhance state of the art
algorithms for positioning and motion tracking applications.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Knowing the posture/location of a person in its environment
becomes an important issue for applications providing services
based on these criteria. Many solutions have been proposed
going from satellite based techniques (i.e. GPS), video tracking
or radio-electrical waves combining. Some of them use optical
signals such as infrared, laser or video tracking approaches,
some use radio signal information (Time Of Flight (TOF) or
RSSI) and others, data provided by IMU. To choose the adequate component for the platform design and obtain the best
trade-off for considered applications, a comparison in terms
of accuracy, deployment facility, size, power consumption and
price has to be done.
As both indoor positioning and motion tracking need low cost,
portable and low power systems which can be deployed in
minutes, radio and IMU are the best candidates. The main
contribution of this paper is a platform named Zyggie that
combines hardware components such as UWB chip for TOF
distances measurement, 2.4 GHz transceiver for RSSI sensing
and an IMU for motion estimations.
Several Zyggie platforms are used to form a Wireless Sensor
Network (WSN) which medium access has to be scheduled.
To do so a custom Time Division Multiple Access Medium
Access Control (TDMA MAC) has been developed to get the
best trade-off between consumption and performance.
Another contribution is the data processing chain which is
composed of some filtering and calibration phases to format

data for positioning and motion tracking algorithms. Two GUIs
have been developed for the this purpose. First a Matlab one
for testing/validating algorithms, then an Android tablet one
for displaying on a 3D avatar the results in real-time.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
summarizes state of the art platforms that propose either
positioning and/or motion tracking capabilities. Section III
introduces the hardware of our new developed platform named
Zyggie. Data exchanges provided by Zyggie are then explained
in Section IV using a custom TDMA MAC protocol. In
Section V output data from Zyggie are used to evaluate
positioning and motion tracking applications (section V-A &
V-B). Finally, conclusions are drawn and future works are
commented in Section VI.
II. R ELATED WORK
Table I lists most relevant solutions for either indoor positioning and/or motion tracking applications. These solutions
are compared in terms of:
• Indoor Positioning and/or Motion Tracking capabilities,
• Accuracy of measurements,
• Deployment which represents the system setup facility
and the flexibility toward the application,
• Size of wearable devices (if needed) and/or the associated
system infrastructure,
• Power consumption,
• Price of the system.
Vicon system [1] is known as a reference in motion tracking
applications due to its millimeter accuracy. Several infrared
cameras are used to track retroreflective markers. This opticalpassive solution allows a long period of use but leads to
significant computation resources and power needs.
Kinect [2] is a low cost general public markerless solution
that embeds infrared and RGB cameras. Depth matrix coupled
with image analysis enable the system to track in 3D space the
attitude of a person. As Kinect has a unique camera viewpoint,
it can lead in some cases to an information loss (i.e. arm
hidden by the user).
Unlike video tracking solutions Xsens is only based on IMU.
High quality hardware and complex processing algorithms
needed for motion tracking applications lead to a good accuracy but high power consumption.
ShotTracker [3] is a basket system monitoring which allows
the positioning of players and the ball in addition to scoring
capability. This solution, based on UWB technology, is only

dedicated to the previously mentioned application due to the
fact that the system is fixed to the building.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee or other Radio Frequency (RF) technologies [4]–[9] can use received signal
power to get distance information between network’s nodes.
Obtaining this RSSI is not consuming but is inaccurate (more
or less 2.5 m) due to its environment perturbations’ sensitivity.
This makes it not suitable for some of the applications.
The global view of Table I highlights the lack of a mobile,
low cost, low power system with reasonable accuracy for both
targeted applications. This lack is filled with Zyggie platform,
detailed in Section III.

we can cite BeSpoon, DecaWave [11], Blinksight and Alereon.
As DecaWave chips are the most open for experimentation
(frequency band, datarate, transmitting power programming),
they were chosen for our prototype (see Section III-B).

III. T HE Zyggie P LATFORM
A. UWB Technology
UWB systems allow to emit low power and ultra-short
duration pulses and provide applications with following advantages:
• High precision TOF ranging at centimeter level,
• Low electromagnetic pollution and reduced interference
to other systems,
• Small size and low power consumption.
TOF computation is explained as following: a message is sent
from the emitter to the receiver and after some processing
time the receiver replies back. The TOF from the emitter to
the receiver is the difference between the time that the emitter
received the response from the receiver and the emission time
divided by 2, by taking care of the response time of the
receiver. Thus, we can compute the distance d depending on
TOF with the following formula


Tre − Tem − Tr
d = T OF.c =
.c ,
(1)
2
where Tem is the emission time, Tre the response reception
time, Tr the response delay of the receiver, and c the celerity
which is assumed to be the same as the light in air. Due to
some drifts on the emitter and receiver frequencies/clocks, an
error is present on the measurements. In order to minimize
this error this scheme can be repeated twice.
There are only few vendors of UWB chipsets among which

Fig. 1. Zyggie WSN Hardware illustration.

The Zyggie node is a Wireless Sensor Node with UWB radio
capabilities that was developed in our lab. Its architecture is
represented on Fig. 1 and composed of:
• A Silicon Labs EFM32 ARM CortexM4 micro-controller
which is the Master Control Unit (MCU) of the node and
also controls the UWB radio chip,
• An ATMEGA2564RFR2 which drives the 2.4 GHz radio
for data exchanges and network synchronization,
• A DecaWave DW1000 UWB radio chip [11] for TOF
measurements,
• An InvenSense IMU for acceleration, angular speed and
magnetic field captures.
Our node is ultra compact (37 mm by 63 mm) and only
weights 32 g (including battery) which makes it a real good
candidate for all applications where weight and size are critical. Some experiments with UWB radio enabled at full speed
were done leading to a battery life time of around 5 hours
which is enough for sportsman or in building applications.
IV. Zyggie MAC P ROTOCOL
The network is composed of identical hardware Zyggie
nodes. One of them is the central node (coordinator) connected
to a computer/tablet, the others are on-body nodes and, if
necessary, off-body fixed nodes for positioning. Coordinator
aggregates data from all Zyggie nodes (Zi with i ∈ [1, N ] and
N the number of nodes) to process and plot them on GUI

Fig. 2. Custom TDMA MAC

presented in Section V-B. A custom TDMA MAC protocol
allocates time slots to each node to allow it sending its sensed
data. All nodes have to sense movement data like IMU information or system absolute orientation, RF messages energy
called RSSI and distance estimation with TOF measurements.
Our MAC is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 communication protocol with a beacon-enable network. The coordinator broadcasts periodically a beacon frame to synchronize nodes and
share network information. As shown on Fig. 2, a full mesh
communication is started to get RSSI information. In its RSSI
time slot, each node sends a short broadcast frame (orange TX
slots) that others will listen (red RX slots) to get a complete
RSSI matrix. As the IMU measurement step starts (purple
time slot), the MCU gets data (red IMU Processing slots) and
optionally performs an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) to
produce a quaternion. Each node in its time slot (Data frame
time slot) sends these data via the 2.4 GHz radio transceiver to
the coordinator. During this star communication phase, nodes
also process TOF ranging measurements. First, the UWB chip
has to be awaken (green Awaking slot), then it can wait to be
used (yellow Idle slots) and finally it does its ranging (orange
& Red TX/RX slots) before returning to sleep. In the example
of Fig. 2 the node 2 is selected to do ranging toward others,
therefore a distances’ vector can be sent to the coordinator at
its next Data frame. A sequence of selected ranging nodes
has to be programmed to get a full distances matrix after
N beacons. Previously defined phases are scheduled to get
the best trade-off between consumption and performance, that
is the reason why transceivers spend a minimum time into
receiving mode. On the other hand, an adaptive data-rate is
implemented depending on the number of nodes, to deal with
the processing and communication time.
V. P ROOF OF CONCEPT
As previously said, our platform can output data that can be
used by users to test algorithms in the context of positioning
and motion tracking. To be user friendly, we have also developed a GUI modeling an avatar in 3D space to visualize the

results. These two aspects are now going to be explained in
more details.
A. Algorithms performance evaluation
Algorithms take part of the processing chain as shown in
Fig. 3. On the chain at the top of the figure, UWB distances
allow to deal with positioning application. On the chain at
the bottom of the figure, computed information coming from
IMU (i.e. quaternions) and UWB distances allow to deal with
motion tracking application. For both applications, it exists
state of the art algorithms (coloured boxes at the end of
the chains) but users can also develop and/or optimize these
algorithms. Blocks involved in these chains are now going to
be presented.

Fig. 3. Zyggie data processing chain

1) Positioning: As we are able to obtain a measured
distance between two nodes the next step is to compute
several distances between a mobile node and some fixed nodes
named anchors. The process chain starts with some corrections
depending on antenna delays and hardware design. Then as
TOF measurements can be noisy, some filtering is done to
remove aberrant values. Finally, to obtain the coordinates of
the mobile a localization algorithm is used (blue Positioning
box in the chain) among we can cite centroid, trilateration,
multilateration, Gauss-Newton [12]–[14] and so on. Users can

also test their algorithms with data provided by Zyggie (i.e.
UWB distances and/or RSSI).
For instance, we experimented 2D positioning of a walking
man using Zyggie with a custom low computation noise-aware
algorithm based on trilateration. For this experimentation, data
were acquired in a room of nearly 243 m2 (26.4 m length by
9.2 m width). The ideal trajectory was marked on the floor
and one step by second (around 3 km/h) was done following
this trajectory. In order to test our algorithm a six anchors
configuration is used. Fig. 4 represents the computed trajectory
by our algorithm in red and the ideal one in green.

(orange Motion Tracking box in the chain).
B. Graphical User Interface
These algorithms were implemented into two GUIs for
different needs. First of all, Matlab was used to make acquisitions and work on raw data. It allows us to display in
real-time raw data like RSSI and UWB distances table and
accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer graphics. Other
features are available for posture and movement recognition
with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) classification algorithm [16]. Targeted applications are in medicine for functional
rehabilitation of a patient or in Human-Machine interaction
with gesture.
Then, an Android tablet application was developed for demonstrations to show the system ability in a mobile context.
Features like IEEE 802.15.4 channel scanning at 2.4 GHz and
3D avatar tracking were added. Positioning algorithms were
also included to update avatar position in a 3D environment
as displayed on Fig. 5.

Fig. 4. Results for indoor walking context

2) Motion tracking: First, we implemented the proprietary
InvenSense EKF on the 32bits MCU in the Zyggie platform to
send less information via RF. This data fusion algorithm converts raw IMU data (i.e. acceleration, rotation and magnitude)
into quaternions to represent absolute system orientation on 3
axes. Then, user needs to do 2 specific postures for Initial and
North calibrations (the first two boxes in the bottom chain of
Fig. 3). Classical ”T” and ”I” postures were chosen to measure
arm movements and calibrate user’s posture. When arms are
raised to form a ”T”, all quaternions are saved to achieve the
computation of
,
qinitjoint = qrawjoint .q0−1
joint

(2)

where joint represents the joint name associated to a node,
qinitjoint the initialized output orientation, qrawjoint the measured orientation and q0joint the initial quaternion equals to
−1
qraw
only during the first calibration posture. After the
joint
second posture done, we select one arm node (i.e. left forearm)
to resolve the System (3) and find the qnorth quaternion.
(

qT = qnorth
.qT .qnorth
,

qI = qnorth .qinitLF .qnorth
where qT is the quaternion to form the ”T” pose, qI the wanted
quaternion to form the ”I” pose and qinitLF the measured and
initialized quaternion for the ”I” pose.
This system is in the form of the Wahba’s problem therefore
a solution can be found with Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) as described in [15]. Solutions can be found with
the other arm nodes to get a single quaternion, therefore
reducing the measuring noise due to both the sensor and user
approximate posture.
Finally, depending on the targeted application, user’s movement or posture can be processed easily with data (i.e. quater-

tennis player is also equipped with nodes for motion tracking.

VI. C ONCLUSION
We have proposed in this paper a new low power, low
cost hardware/software platform named Zyggie for indoor
positioning and motion tracking applications. Zyggie combines
UWB technology for accurate indoor positioning and IMU
for motion tracking; RSSI metrics can also be inputted for
both applications. Our prototype has been validated in real
use cases (indoor human tracking). An Android application
has also been developed for real-time visualization on a tablet.
Finally Zyggie offers the opportunity for users to test their own
developed algorithms in the Matlab environment.
