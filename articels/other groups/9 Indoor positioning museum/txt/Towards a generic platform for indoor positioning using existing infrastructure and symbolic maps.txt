Preface
User-adaptive systems have evolved from small-scale stand-alone applications
to interactive Web-based applications that are often deployed on a larger scale.
Consequently, the need has arisen to move from prototypical systems to scalable,
deployable solutions. At the same time, a shift can be seen from rule-based, mentalistic user modeling approaches to ’Web 2.0’ approaches that involve machine
learning, data mining, and collaborative techniques.
Past research provided a large body of methods for adaptation/personalization, and techniques for user modeling, usage mining, and collaborative filtering.
Conceptual frameworks splitting the adaptation process into various layers provide guidance for implementing user-adaptive systems. Based on these building
blocks, various groups have created their own frameworks, among others AHA!,
APELS, and Personal Reader. Framework design provides an opportunity to
reuse components or even whole layers of the adaptation process. Reuse of components such as user behavior observation and logging tools, user model storage
promotes faster development, better feature selection, and more robust systems.
Although, system fragmentation enables component reuse and speeds up the
development of the new systems, there are several issues. First, decomposition
of a monolithic system should result in a good abstraction of the data and process model to provide a convenient basis for reuse. Second, the data traffic between the separated system components may intensify. As the number of system
users increases issues related to scalability might arise. This is especially true
for user-adaptive and cognitive systems where the modeling and personalization
components are traditionally computationally and data intensive.
Existing work on the Web-based user-adaptive and cognitive systems, including work on frameworks, shown that there exists a strong overlap between
conceptual models of the decomposed adaptation process and the practical implications of its design. In this situation, a logical step is to compare already
working systems with emerging approaches and models. In this workshop we
seek to identify current practices and experiences with concrete implementations of user-adaptive and cognitive systems or specific components - varying
from experimental, small-scale prototypes to systems that are deployed on a
larger scale.
The topics of this workshop include but are not limited to:
– user behavior observation and user data collection: embedded into the adaptive system or available as standalone components or add-ons,
– user data management: data storage platforms and formats, the use of open
standards, querying techniques or APIs, interoperability issues,
– reusing reasoning and adaptation techniques,
– scalability and performance issues of user modeling and adaptation,
– generalizable techniques for adaptation, personalization and recommendation,
– translations of conceptual designs into concrete implementation,
– deployment issues and lessons learned (case studies and evaluation).

This problem can be approached by using user modeling servers (UMS) \fdedG].
According to Kobsa [8], the purpose of user modelling servers is to separate user
modelling functionality from user-adaptive application systems. They are not a part of
an application system but rather independent from it . In this way, an UMS is part of a
distributed learning environment which provides teachers and users with educational
services. ADAPT2 [9] is an example of a framework for distributed education that
integrates an UMS as part of its architecture. It stores students' activity and infers
student's knowledge. When a student interacts with systems that have their own UMS,
ADAPT2 facilitates user models integration by means of Ontology Servers. It allows
the knowledge of the same student to be modeled by multiple systems along different
ontologies and stored on different ontology servers. However, once several adaptive
systems decide to collaborate in sharing and exchanging student models, they have to
select one specific ontology ;then the server used for user model exchange will be the
one that hosts the selected ontology.

Abstract. Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS) have long been mainly
represented by domain- or application-specific systems. Few reference
models exist and they provide only a brief overview of how to describe
and organize the ‘adaptation process’ in a generic way. In this paper we
consider the process aspects of AHS from the very first classical ‘user
modelling-adaptation’ loop to a generic detailed flowchart of the adaptation in AHS. We introduce a Generic Adaptation Process and by aligning
it with a layered (data-oriented) AHS architecture we show that it can
serve as the process part of a new reference model for AHS.

1

Introduction and Background

Throughout the development of the Hypermedia and later Adaptive Hypermedia
(AH) research field people have been trying to create ‘reference’ models of these
categories of systems. Major reference models have been favouring a layered
architecture, starting with the Dexter Hypertext Model [7], and later the Tower
Model [5] (introduced as the Extensible Data Model for Hyperdocuments) and
this was continued in adaptive hypermedia with the most referenced AHAM [6]
model, followed by other systems/models, such as LAOS [11] (elaborating layered
approach), APeLS [4], the Munich model [10], etc. However, these developments
were mostly concerned with the structure and/or the data model, but not as
much with the process underlying the adaptation.
In the paper we examine the issue of aligning the adaptation process, based
on an extensive list of AH methods and techniques [9], with a layered structure
of AHS. We show that to some extent the process influences and defines the
composition and the sequence of such a layered structure in such a way that
it partially arranges the order of the layers, defines couplings and determines
the major transitions in the system. We show that the process driven approach
gives more insight in AH development methods and the composition of the AH
system.
1.1

Adaptation Process Modelling

Hereafter by Generic Adaptation Process we mean the interaction in AHS which
starts with the goal statement, exploits features of the user and domain models in

13

different contexts and adapts various aspects of the information and presentation
to the user. Figure 1 shows this user modeling / adaptation loop as originally
presented in [3].

Fig. 1. Classic loop user modelling - adaptation

Considering a generic adaptive system one may think not only about defining
a framework or reference (data) model but also about what the adaptation process within the system looks like, beyond what Fig. 1 shows. Fig. 2 shows some
extensions of the classical loop, taking into account that selection of user information or reasoning about the user model to obtain answers about the user is an
essential part of the adaptation process (Fig. 2a) and that either the user or an
administrator (or both) need the ability to scrutinize the user model (Fig. 2b).

Fig. 2. User modelling - adaptation loops

These updated ‘user-modelling - adaptation’ loops give a more extensive
overview of some aspects of the adaptation, however in [9] we integrated the
entire classification of AH methods and techniques (see Sect. 2) with the adaptation process cycle to give a first insight into the generic adaptation process
flow, see Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Classification of AH methods and techniques; adaptation process highlights [9]

Although coupling the AH methods classification with the ‘adaptation process’ had a different purpose from what is shown in the classical (and later)
loops of ‘user modelling - adaptation’ - our goal is to show the diversity of the
adaptation process representation and the possibility of aligning not only the
‘user-adaptation’ loop into the adaptation process but the adaptation methods
and techniques as well.
1.2

Goals

In this paper we describe the reference adaptation process, aligning it with the
traditional ‘adaptation questions’ (Sect. 2) and formalizing it in a single generic
manner. In particular, we:
– provide a flowchart diagram of a generic AHS (based on the summarization
from [9]);
– put the notion of the adaptation process in a context of a generic layered
adaptation system;
– align the layers of AHS in a sequence chart and present the reference adaptation process.

2

Questions of Adaptation and Adaptation Sequence

Adaptation can be defined by posing and answering six major questions:
– Why do we need adaptation? (Why? )
– What can we adapt? (What? )
– What can we adapt to? (To What? )
– When can we apply adaptation? (When? )
– Where can we apply adaptation? (Where? )
– How do we adapt? (How? )

15

This type of classification has been initially introduced in [3]. Here we not just
revisit these questions, but address the issue of aligning them (also aligning the
corresponding methods, techniques and respective modules (layers) of AHS) in a
generic adaptation process which can serve as a process guideline and framework
for defining the way AHS functions.
Fig. 3 considers the order in which the adaptation questions should be asked
(and answered), thus leading to a first informal definition of the adaptation process. The classification of AH methods and techniques is outlined by the solid
lines representing the typical dimensions for the analysis of adaptive systems [12];
at the same time we join the same classification blocks considering the adaptation process perspective which is depicted by dotted line. This process is usually
initiated by the user stating the adaptation goal and thus answering the ‘Why
adaptation is needed?’ question. Then in the process we consider the ‘What?’
and ‘To What?’ questions, which emphasize Domain Model (DM) and UM descriptions. ‘When?’ and ‘Where?’ go next providing context and application area
definitions. Lastly, the ‘How?’ question describes methods and techniques on a
conceptual and implementation level and finally all together result in AHS description.
Taking into account user needs and system components (anticipating both
core and optionally available components) we would like to present the process
which explains the transitions, states, sequences and flows in a generic AHS. First
we revisit a few such systems. Then, based on the research and summarization
done in [9], we present the flowcharts of an adaptive system and finally come
up with the conceptual sequence chart of a layer-structured Generic Adaptation
Framework (GAF).
Considering the adaptation process in other systems we mention a few examples of how the authors tried to catch an idea of defining the adaptation
processes (both implicitly or explicitly) in their systems and matching processes
with the layered structure of their systems.

Fig. 4. Overview of the General Ontological Model for Adaptive Web Environments
(GOMAWE)

In the GOMAWE system [1] (Fig. 4)the authors tried to fit the adaptation
process in the general ontological model of the system they designed. Though
there is still much to be considered in terms of the real inter-layer transitions,

16

we can already observe a few basic transitions such as the Event Interface which
either triggers the Push Reasoning or provides the data for the Pull Reasoning
interfaces of the Reasoning layer. Here ‘Push’ is responsible for transforming user
events into UM updates which happens when users interact with the system, and
‘Pull’ retrieves the UM state. Moreover these connections tie different layers of
the designed system together.

Fig. 5. Lifecycle Model of Adaptation (Munich Model)

The Munich model defined by Koch in [10] (Fig. 5) presented the lifecycle
model of adaptation in the UML formalized notion. It defines the following ’layers’ or components or states to be tied by these process loops: presentation,
interaction, user observation, and adjustments of the systems (which include
Adaptation itself and UM updates). These cycles start with an initial presentation and a default UM. Stereotypes are usually used to provide the information
for the initial UM. Then the following steps of adaptation cycle follow [10]:
– System Interaction - which describes how to react to certain user action(s),
resulting in the termination of this cycle and adaptive continuation.
– User observation - in which the evaluation of the information got from UM
is being done.
– Adjustments - comprising the two sub-states: User model update - in which
UM attributes are updated; System adaptation - in which the adaptation is
performed (adaptation of presentation, content or navigation) utilizing the
state of UM.
– Presentation - when the system presents the adaptable elements taking into
account the information system knows about the user and remains in this
state until the user starts interacting with system over again.
To some extent most of the adaptation ‘loops’ fall under this classification. Most
of these interactions are continuous and recursive when the user continues using
the system and explores the knowledge base in depth. We should also mention
that here we don’t consider any concurrent loops that may happen and influence
each other in every aspect.

Adaptation Process Flowcharts

In the following section we summarise the procedural knowledge of the data/control
and other flows in AHS and come up with the generic representation of AHS
processes.
Hereafter we present the adaptation process flowcharts, which generalize the
functionality of the AHS. In fact these flowcharts follow the system properties
summarization presented in [9], (Tables 1, 2). Based on the summarised (and
generalized) functionality we devise these generic adaptation process flowcharts.
The abstract representation of the process is shown in Fig. 6 which is elaborated
further.
We distinguish the following flowcharts:

Fig. 6. Generic Adaptation Flowchart (to be considered as the aggregation of Figs. 7-8)

Each flowchart represents a certain aspect of the adaptation process, annotated to give more insight in the description of some blocks. On the right side
of each chart we link parts of the process to the layers of the GAF model. The
communication between the layers is illustrated in Fig. 9. We also mark with
numbers the exact correspondence of Fig. 9 calls and transitions with the outlined blocks on the flowcharts (Figs. 7-8) in order to show the conformity of the
sequence and flowchart approaches.
In the ‘Goal acquisition and adaptation flowchart’ (Fig. 7) we start with the
group analysis, thus assigning the user to a group or acquiring group properties
in order to take them into account while choosing the adaptation goals. Here
we also make assumptions that the user can belong to only one group and may
not switch to another group within a session. The user may have his/her own

18

goal or be advised by the system to (also) use the group goal. In any case goal
suitability is checked to determine whether the user can follow it. All suitable
goals are elaborated in a sequence of concepts or the most appropriate ‘project’
(defined set of concepts to study) is chosen.
The ‘Adaptation functionality flowchart’ (Fig. 8) presents the main Adaptation Engine (AE) functionality in a sequence of concept-content adaptation
steps for a particular user. In general we analyse conditions for a particular step
and execute adaptation rules which apply adaptation techniques and perform
presentation, content and navigation adaptation. After that UM attributes are
updated accordingly and the user proceeds with the next concept either on a
‘one-per-click’ or project-organized basis. This figure looks very similar to what
was done the in IMMPS model [2], presenting a reference architecture for intelligent multimedia presentation systems where the knowledge server was separated
from the main flowchart in order to separate and retain the knowledge base from
other system functionality. For the same reasons to separate AE functionality
we have the distinguished ‘concept-content adaptation interaction’ block.
‘Test-feedback functionality’ goes in the end. Here if such a feedback is required the user continues either with the external evaluation or internal assessment which could be the part of a project or a separate questionary or test
instance. If this test is failed, user goals might be refined and he/she could be
requested start all over again.

‘Rotating’ the Layers of AHS: Adaptation Process and
the Layered Model

The conceptual structure of GAF [8] aligns the order of the layers in the system
according to the classification of AH methods and techniques (Fig. 3). Though
this order represents the basic understanding of the adaptation questions, every
particular system may vary or even omit some of these, thus leading to a different
composition of the system layers determined by the different adaptation process.
Now, considering the generalized adaptation process flow- charts presented
in (Figs. 7-8) and the layered nature of AHS [9] we would like to present the
generic adaptation process. We believe that in order to couple, align, sort and
arrange the layers of such a system (both generic model or some particular
domain focused implementation) one should keep in mind an adaptation process
sequence that will partially determine the layers arrangement and to some extent
will define the mandatory and optional elements and drive the system design.
Thus we decided to rotate the anticipated layered structure representation by
90 degrees counter-clockwise and match it with the adaptation process flowchart.
Fig. 9 shows such an abstraction of a generic adaptation process in terms of the
system layers. (It has been rotated once more to fit on the page and be readable.)
We have marked the communication arrows with numbers to set up a correspondence with the flowcharts, where respective blocks are outlined and marked
with the same numbers. This is done to show the coherence of the sequence and
flowcharts. We should also note that not every connection in the adaptation pro-

cess sequence exists in the above-mentioned flowcharts due to the more extensive
description of the GAF process sequence chart. The marked connections are:
1. User goals are defined. In case the user doesn’t define any goal it can be
proposed by the system or a group goal is used;
2. User goals are aligned with DM, considering the conceptual structure of the
domain. According to the selected goal a suitable set of concepts to follow
is chosen;
3. Adaptation is initiated and control is passed to the Application Model (AM);
4. Operations of UM properties such as acquisition and update are performed
here (corresponds to a few places on the flowchart);
5. Operations mainly concerned working with the concepts from DM;
6. Appropriate adaptation methods and techniques are invoked;
7. Retrieved content is passed to the Presentation model to be rendered/generated
and presented to the user;
8. Corresponding content (for concerned concepts) is retrieved from the Resource model and handed over back to AM;
9. Group related operations (assigning users, retrieving group properties, defining new groups, etc.).

Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we defined and elaborated various aspects of the Generic Adaptation Process, introduced its model, flowchart and sequence chart. To comply
with the layered model we anticipate that the aforementioned process structure
will influence the layered composition of the AHS in such a way that the process
defined by the system engineer will partially drive the order of the layers of such
AHS and define important inter-layer transitions. At the same time we anticipate
that the defined processes together with the reference model (e.g. emerging GAF
or well known AHAM) may serve as a foundation for the system design, defining
not only the system components but the system ‘functionality flow’ as well, or
even deviate into a separate branch of so-called ‘process-driven’ architectures
in the AH field. Moreover the formalized process driven approach gives more
insight on AH development methods and unifies this development approach and
system organization as it was first mentioned in [10].
We have started elaboration of the generic layered structure of AHS in [9] and
then gave the first look at this kind of layered generic structure in [8]. This led
to a process-oriented view of a generic layered AHS which was presented in this
paper. Based on the research done in [9] we managed to devise a generic flowchart
that fits most popular AHS. And finally considering the layered (de)composition
of an adaptive system we present a conceptual view of a generic adaptation
process (Fig. 9).
In the future we plan to extend the adaptation process sequence with more details, elaborate the process description, particularly inter-layer interaction, sustaining the generic approach, at the same time emphasizing the interoperability

Abstract. In this paper we present the so-called Grapple User Modeling Framework (GUMF) which provides user modeling functionality
via the Web to applications that would like to offer personalization and
adaptation features to their customers. GUMF introduces the notion
dataspaces which create a logical view on (possibly distributed) user data
and provide advanced contextualization and reasoning mechanisms. We
showcase the Mypes service that exploits GUMF dataspaces to connect,
aggregate, align and enrich user profile information form the Social Web.

Introduction

Adaptive systems require information about their users to adapt their functionality [1]. Today, users leave a plethora of traces on the Web that could possibly
serve as input for these systems: people provide profile information in social networking services such as Facebook or LinkedIn, annotate their pictures and bookmarks at Flickr or Delicious, and write about their interests in their (micro)blogs.
Thereby a lot of useful profile information becomes publicly available [2] . Further, the aggregation of such distributed user data is supported by initiatives
such as the Linked Data initiative [3], standardization of APIs (e.g. OpenSocial1 )
and authentication and authorization protocols (e.g. OpenID, OAuth), as well
as by (Semantic) Web standards such as RDF, RSS and specific vocabularies
such as FOAF2 , SIOC3 , or GUMO [4]. Generic user modeling servers such as
CUMULATE [5] or PersonIs [6] facilitate handling of aggregated user data. The
Grapple User Modeling Framework (GUMF) [7] follows these approaches and
offers means to deliver customized user modeling functionality to its clients.
In this paper we discuss so-called GUMF dataspaces that embody and enforce the actual user modeling intelligence of GUMF. We present the Mypes
service4 which exploits dataspaces to connect, aggregate, align and enrich user

media services (Flickr, Delicious, StumbleUpon, Twitter, Blogspot) and others
(Google). Mypes enables users to overview their distributed profiles and via
GUMF it allows application developers to integrate aggregated, semantically
enriched profile data in RDF or vCard format via a lightweight REST interface
into their applications to provide personalization and adaptation functionalities.

Grapple User Modeling Framework

Figure 1 shows the architecture of GUMF. The elements at the top provide the
essential, generic functionality of the framework; elements part at the bottom
right provide generic as well as domain-specific reasoning logic. Client applications can access GUMF either via a RESTful or SOAP-based API. Further, there
is a Java Client API that facilitates development of GUMF client applications5 .
Client applications mainly approach GUMF to store user information (handled
by the Store Module) or to query for information (handled by Query Engine).
User profile information is modeled by Grapple statements [7], which are basically reified RDF statements about a user, enriched with provenance metadata.
GUMF currently supports SPARQL and SeRQL queries as well as Grapple query,
a pattern-based query language that exploits the Grapple statement structure to
specify what kind of statements should be returned by GUMF. Authorized client
requests are answered by GUMF’s Dataspace Logic. Dataspaces concentrate the
actual user modeling capabilities of GUMF. They are equipped with data storage repositories that either reside at the GUMF server or are distributed across
the Web (possibly maintained by the client application itself), and with (reasoning) plug-ins that further enrich the data that is available in the repositories or
transform user data into a structure/format that is appropriate for the GUMF
client applications that request user data.
The Administrator of a GUMF client application can configure dataspaces
and plug-ins via the GUMF Admin Interface. Activating or deactivating plug5

adjust the plug-ins and reasoning rules to their needs. In the next section we
will highlight GUMF dataspaces and describe plug-ins we implemented that
support aggregation of user data from the Social Web. These plug-ins and the
corresponding dataspace enable Mypes to visualize the distributed user data
traces. Moreover, as GUMF dataspaces can be shared across different client
applications, we also enable other client applications to benefit from the profile
aggregation.

Mypes: Enriching User Profiles via GUMF

To illustrate the functionality of GUMF dataspaces we present the Mypes service which is a GUMF client application that particularly highlights GUMF’s
ability to support the task of gathering information about users for user adaptive
systems [1]. In this section we first present the GUMF components we implemented to allow for profile aggregation and enrichment before we describe Mypes
features in more detail.
3.1

Linkage, Aggregation, Alignment and Enrichment of User Data

The Grapple User Modeling Framework aims to provide a uniform interface to
user data that might be distributed on the Web. To feature access to distributed
user data and to align and enhance the data, GUMF and the corresponding
GUMF components depicted in Figure 2 respectively perform the following steps.
1. Account Mapping Given a user’s URI of an online account, the account
mapping plug-in gathers other online accounts of the same user by exploiting
the Google Social Graph API6 , which provides such mappings for all users
who linked their accounts via their Google profile, for example:

Table 1. Profile data for which Mypes provides crawling capabilities: (i) traditional
profile attributes, (ii) tag-based profiles (= tagging activities performed by the user),
and (iii) blog, photo, and bookmark posts respectively.
"http://www.google.com/profiles/fabian.abel": "claimed_nodes": [
"http://delicious.com/fabianabel",
"http://fabianabel.stumbleupon.com",
"http://www.last.fm/user/fabianabel/", ...]

For those users where no mappings can be obtained via API, it is possible to
provide appropriate mappings by hand. The account mapping module finally
provides a list of online accounts that are associated to a particular user.
2. Social Web Aggregator For the URIs associated to the user, the aggregator module gathers profile data from the corresponding services. In particular, traditional profile information (e.g., name, homepage, location, etc.),
tag-based profiles (tagging activities), and posts (e..g, bookmark postings,
blog posts, picture uploads) are harvested from nine different services as
depicted in Table 1.
3. Profile Alignment The profiles gathered from the different services are
aligned with GUMF’s uniform user model by means of hand-crafted rules,
i.e. the user data is modeled by means of Grapple statements [7] using FOAF
or vCard as domain-specific vocabulary for the actual user attributes (e.g.,
name, homepage, etc.). For example, given the full name of a user’s Google
or Flickr profile, GUMF creates a statement as follows.
@prefix gc: <http://grapple-project.org/grapple-core/> .
<http://grapple-project.org/gumf/statement-2010-05-19-bob-name>
rdf:type
gc:Statement;
gc:user
<http://bob.myopenid.com>;
gc:predicate <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name>;
gc:object
"Bob Mayer";
gc:created
"2010-05-19T16:23:04.243+01:00" .

4. Semantic Enrichment Tag-based profiles are further enriched and clustered by means of WordNet7 categories so that GUMF client applications
can, for example, access particular parts of a tag-based profile such as facets
related to locations or people.
The four plug-ins can be plugged into dataspaces. We applied them to the
Mypes dataspace which forms the basis for the Mypes service.

Mypes Service

Mypes exploits GUMF to provide an interface that is valuable for casual users,
who would like to overview their distributed profile data. Further, it makes
the enriched public profile data that is available via the Mypes dataspace (see
Figure 2) also available via a lightweight RESTful interface (in FOAF and vCard
format). Hence, thanks to GUMF and the plug-ins presented above, Mypes just
has to focus on representing the public profile data – either for end-users or for
systems that require additional information about their users.
Given the Google profile URI of a user, Mypes queries GUMF and the Mypes
dataspace particularly to obtain the corresponding aggregated, enriched profile
data. It then enables users to overview their public profiles, for example, users
can inspect particular profile values, analyze the completes of their profiles on
a bar chart and understand to what kind of information about themselves is
publicly available. Mypes thus raises the users’ awareness of their profile data
distributed across different services on the Web.
Figure 3(a) shows an example of an aggregated Mypes profile, namely the traditional profile attributes gathered from the diverse services (see Table 1). When
accessing http://mypes.groupme.org/mypes/user/116033/rdf the FOAF profile in RDF/XML syntax is returned. Mypes exports all available values for a
profile attribute, e.g., if a user specifies her name differently at the different
services then all these different values are provided.
GUMF also connects the tagging activities users perform in the different
tagging systems. As the semantic enrichment plug-in (see Fig. 2) extends tag
assignments with meta-information that states to which WordNet category the
corresponding tag belongs to, it is possible to filter the aggregated tag cloud
of a user according to WordNet categories. For example, Figure 3(b) shows the
aggregated tag cloud filtered so that only tags related to locations are displayed.
For this kind of tag cloud, Mypes provides an alternative visualization: tags
related to locations are mapped to country codes (using the GeoNames Web

29

service8 ), which are sent to Google’s visualization API to draw a geographical
intensity map that highlights those countries that are frequently (possibly indirectly) referenced by tags in the profile (see bottom in Figure 3(b)). Mypes also
features RDF export for these (specific facets of) tag-based profiles using the
Tag Ontology9 and SCOT10 vocabulary.

Conclusion

In this paper we described how the Grapple User Modeling Framework (GUMF)
enables to enrich user profiles with user data gathered from the Social Web.
We presented the Mypes service that exploits this functionality to enable casual
users to overview their distributed profiles and allows adaptive applications to
re-use the aggregated and enhanced profile information for their own purposes.
In our future work we plan to evaluate the actual benefit for end-users of adaptive
applications which make their adaptation decisions based on the enriched profiles
produced by GUMF and Mypes respectively.

Abstract. This paper presents and architecture that is being developed to
generate adaptive accessible interfaces taking into consideration the features of
users with disabilities, the characteristics of the devices that they use to access
remote services, and other context features. In order to perform the modelling
of the diverse parameters under consideration an ontological approach has been
chosen. This research is part of the INREDIS project that has the purpose of
creating a universally accessible, interoperable and ubiquitous environment to
allow people with disabilities to control service machines and /or different
targets.
Keywords: adaptive interfaces, accessibility, ontologies, user modelling.

1 Introduction
Services that are accessible through the Internet should be accessible, ubiquitous, and
interoperable. Unfortunately, this is not the current situation since most interfaces do
no
t take into account the needs of the users nor the context in which the interaction is
performed. The specific characteristics of the device used to request the service are
also frequently ignored, which has a negative impact on the accessibility, usability,
ubiquity and interoperability of the service. Adaptation is very helpful to overcome
accessibility barriers. It is based on user modelling that allows tailored interactions
based on relevant user features such as skills, preferences, interests, etc. In addition, a
number of other context features are taken into account to optimize the adaptation
process, such as the task and the objective that the user wants to achieve.
The research work presented in this paper is carried out in the framework of the
INREDIS project [1], which aims to provide universal accessibility, interoperability
and ubiquity in order to allow people with disabilities to control service machines,
vending machines, home appliances, etc. In this paper we aim to depict the
architecture of the Interface Generator module that is used to produce adaptive
interfaces taking into account the relevant characteristics of users with disabilities and
context features, including the characteristics of the devices used to access these
services. Ontologies are used in order to perform the modelling of the diverse
parameters taken into consideration because they allow reusability, besides they allow
extracting new information through inferences.

37

In relation to the method for storing and processing data for modelling, some
approaches propose mark-up languages to model the user (e.g. HumanML [2]) while
others propose the use of ontologies (such as GUMO [3]). In addition to the user
characteristics, other projects (such as CAP [4]), also consider specific issues related
to context. Most of these approaches are predominantly focused on user modelling.
Though, adaptive interfaces devoted to the support of people with disabilities have to
consider several other issues included in the interaction context, such as accessibility
[5] [6] or affective resources [7]. Taking into account the principal advantages offered
by these researches, our approach is focused on modelling not only the user but also
the technological context and non-technological context.

3 The INREDIS Approach
In order to create adaptive accessible interfaces for people with disabilities within the
INREDIS project, a module called the “Interface Generator” has been designed. Its
aim is to provide universal access for anyone, including people with disabilities,
regardless the device used or the service that is accessed. To achieve this objective, it
is necessary to model the different aspects of the domain where the user is interacting.
Several approaches have been studied to model these features and eventually an
ontological model was chosen, since ontologies offer automated reasoning, dynamic
classification and consistence checking giving the opportunity of extracting other
relevant features without interfere the user.
In order to take into account all relevant aspects of the user and his context, three
different ontologies have been designed and some others are still in the
conceptualization phase. Subsequently, all the ontologies designed have been
integrated through a global ontology that is modular enough to encompass future
ontologies, if they are needed. User ontology has been designed to model the skills
and characteristics of the users. User Device Ontology aims to gather all the
information about the device used by the user to interact with the system. Target
Ontology has the objective of modelling the characteristics of the possible targets or
services that can be integrated, such as ATMs, vending machines, and so on.
In addition to these ontologies, there are others in the conceptualization phase that
will be built when they are required. These are Interface Ontology to guide the
process of deciding interface mark-up language and components; Adaptations
Ontology to model the best adaptations for each user stereotype; and Assistive
Technologies Ontology to model the diverse assistive technologies accessible trough
the INREDIS framework. More information can be obtained in [8].

4 Proposed architecture and component modules
The architecture designed to generate adaptive accessible interfaces is composed of
diverse modules, each one provided with specific functionalities to perform specific
tasks. It is highly flexible to enable the incorporation of new modules providing new
functionalities in the future. IG Manager Module is an orchestrator that manages the

38

whole process and the functionalities of the Interface Generator. Constructor Module
is responsible for creating a default interface in an abstract language. Resources
Manager Module analyses the resources provided by the target to determine whether
these resources are compatible with the user and the user’s device. Selector Module
has to decide which adaptations must be performed to obtain an accessible interface.
Adapter Module applies the adaptations selected by the selector module to the default
interface, obtaining an adaptive accessible interface, supported by the user and his/her
device and which is able to control target functionalities. Data Injector Module
checks whether there is an interface previously generated for the current type of user,
device and target. More information about these modules can be obtained in [8].

5 Conclusion
A prototype has been developed to verify the adequacy of the architecture proposed.
Although the interaction with the ontologies was only simulated, this prototype
showed the functionality and validity of each module and detected its inconsistencies
and deficiencies. We are currently developing a more complete version of the
Interface Generator that extends its features to allow adaptation to all the stereotypes
provided by the general ontology, regardless the device and the target.

Abstract. PERSEUS is a standalone personalization service provider. It follows
the idea of separating the adaptation logic from the AHS and offering it as an
on-demand service. PERSEUS provides full abstraction from the adaptation
models and methods. Since its first deployment, PERSEUS has seen intensive
use and has been the primary source of personalization in about 20 coursesemesters. It offers a set of adaptive guidance and recommendation services.
The target of this demo is to demonstrate PERSEUS’s potential of providing
personalized access to the interactive educational resources.
Keywords: service-based personalization, adaptation, adaptive hypermedia

1 Introduction
Modularization and component reuse is one of the major and most promising trends in
the field of adaptive educational hypermedia. This process has started even before
adaptive hypermedia systems came to existence. Early user modeling shells separated
from the user-adaptive systems in the 1980s. In the late 1990s, open-corpus
hypermedia allowed content to be added at the run-time rather than at the design time.
Today we are witnessing the emerging split of the adaptation models and methods
themselves form the adaptive hypermedia system (AHS) that changes from all-in-one
tool to the open integrator of the interactive technology
In this demo we are presenting PERSEUS, a personalization server that offers an
abstraction of the adaptation methods to the AHS developers. With PERSEUS
adaptation can be consumed rather than built-in and can be reused in many contexts
and easily replaced without changing the structure of the content. PERSEUS reduces
the problem of adaptation provision to the problem of configuration. A recently added
innovative feature of PERSEUS – an embedlet – allows adaptation to be built even
into static HTML page.

2 PERSEUS – Personalization Services Engine
The conceptual idea of how PERSEUS works is shown in Fig.1. A content
management system (here Knowledge Tree portal) provides access to a pre-

40

constructed hyperspace. To render a personalized view of a particular page, the portal
consults the personalization service engine. To do that, the portal sends the structure
of the currently viewed page (as an RSS1.0/RDF feed) and context information
(user/group id, personalization algorithm code, etc.). PERSEUS queries user
modeling server(s) (and/or other data sources known to it) and performs the
adaptation that was requested. The returned result is an original RSS1.0/RDF page
feed with personalizing updates. The new feed may have original links reordered or
removed, new links inserted, annotations added to links. The portal parses the feed
and renders a personalized page for the user.

Fig. 1. Example of PERSEUS’s topic-based adaptive navigation for Knowledge Tree [1] portal.
Adaptive annotations (targets with darts) produced by PERSEUS are enclosed in a square. Here
CUMULATE [2] is utilized as the user modeling server.

The compliance threshold for the portal to be able to use PERSEUS is minimal.
Every personalization method implemented in PERSEUS is exposed as a RESTful
web service. The portal has to be able to package its pages’ link structures as a simple
RSS1.0/RDF document and send it as one of the parameters to the selected service
URL. PERSEUSE’s response – modifications to the link structure, including
annotations with descriptive JavaScript tooltips – should be parsed again.

3 PERSEUS Embedlets – Adaptation Made Easy
A recent extension to the PERSEUS called embedlet allows adaptive hypermedia
authors to skip data exchange protocol in its entirety and paste snippets of adaptively
annotated lists of resources as plain HTML code. An embedlet is a stationary
configured call to one of the PERSEUS’s adaptation techniques. It is comprised of an
RSS1.0/RDF document, containing a flat link list representing a large portion of the

41

hyperspace and a pointer to the desired personalization service. Each embedlet is
exposed as quasi personalization service.
To invoke an embedlet one should insert an object HTML tag into the web page
with data attribute pointing to the embedlet’s URL. To only show part of the links
from the embedlet’s exhaustive list one must use an additional parameter and specify
an enumeration of links numbers in the bound list. User and/or group identity need to
be present in the embedlet as well. However, in the case of group-based navigation
(cf. Fig.2), no individual users are distinguished, and group identity could also be
statically bound, which allows adaptive navigation embedlets to be successfully used
in static HTML pages.
Embedlets are equivalent to regular PERSEUS services in terms of adaptation
functionality offered. However, in terms of authoring they are significantly easier to
aggregate into existing content.
