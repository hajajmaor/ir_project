Abstract. The use of marker in museum can ruin the aesthetics of a room. In this paper, we
will describe ARGuide. ARGuide is a guiding application to help museum visitors, which is
implemented on Android smartphone. It uses an unmarked augmented reality method. The
application has been developed and tested. The testing is conducted by tracking some objects
in a real museum. It shows that ARGuide is able to track different objects at about 63.64% with
the tracking speed of between 2-6 seconds. However, ARGuide is not able to work properly if
there is either limited or excessive lighting.
Keywords—augmented reality; unmarked, guidance system; museum; tracking

1. Introduction
Museum can be determined as a place to collect historical and memorial objects. Almost half of the
museum visitors come to a museum just to see the objects, not to interact with them. In Indonesia, more
than half of 275 museums are not yet complete as it has to be, and they need to be revitalized.
Moreover, the revitalization is expected to provide more function such as a universal medium for
preservation cultural heritage, creative and interactive tools. For this effort, a creative and effective
strategy is required.
Normally, the visitor needs a tour guide that will serve and tell some information about museum and
all objects. A tour guide also guides the visitor to visit all of rooms of the museum. There will be a
problem, when the museum is crowded so that the tour guide could not serve each of visitors.
E-museum is a concept to use electronic devices such as PC desktop, television, smartphone and
others in a museum. The use of devices gives more experiences for the visitor by increasing the
interactivity and creativity values.
Nowadays, mobile technology has grown rapidly and almost everyone has a smartphone, so it allow
us to implement the augmented reality on mobile devices [1]. Research on navigation systems using
mobile phone and Augmented Reality (AR) technology has been conducted and introduced at some
museums in the world. For example, National Palace Museum in Taiwan has developed a digital
navigation system using RFID, and has become a pioneer in digital navigation of museum. With this
navigation system, museum visitors can get voice-based information about the objects of the museum
through earphones. They reported that the use of the technology can increase the interest of the visitors
to come to museum.

American Museum of Natural History Application from the American of Natural History provides
guidance service using text and Wi-Fi positioning with indoor AGPS. Using Wi-Fi for positioning with
indoor AGPS is a one way of getting the location of visitor accurately.
Vision-based location positioning system and AR for indoor environment allow information service
to visitor [2]. This application uses AR marker and displays some 3D objects together with audio
information. Through this application, museum visitors can get some information interactively.
The using of marker AR in museum could ruin the aesthetics of room because of marker AR uses a
specific image as marker. Unmarked technique could be implemented in museum. Unmarked AR is a
technique that uses object or natural image in real world as a marker. In this paper, we propose a
museum guidance system. The system is built based on a case study that has been carried out in
Museum Sonobudoyo Yogyakarta.
2. Related Work
Augmented Reality is used in military and technological system for the first time [3]. But Augmented
Reality (AR) has increased significantly in recent years. Augmented Reality (AR) is a concept of
combining the real world with virtual objects created by computer graphics [4]. AR can be
implemented in various sectors such as visual information, navigation systems in real world,
advertising, military, games, education, and so on. AR is usually implemented in navigation system
for the museum visitors.
Navigation systems require information about location. Based on the location, there are two
different navigation systems: indoor and outdoor. Research on indoors navigation for museum base on
smartphone that consists of location positioning (localization) and content-based augmented reality
has been conducted by several researchers. It has proven that it gives more benefits for the museum.
For example, the efficiency of mobile guidance system using AR makes usefulness and effectiveness
in exhibition at National Museum Korea [5]. This system uses method-tracking algorithm to estimate
the accuracy of image adaptively for objects in museum.
3D AR mobile navigation system that supports indoor positioning system has been developed in the
campus of Oxford [4]. The system tells about history of Oxford in the past and the future in 3D and
based on multimedia that includes the navigation system, the positioning based on RFID, and
unmarked AR technology to detect the location of visitors actively. Activity-based instructions method
with 3D location is used to get point of the building and success to find that balance between mixtureAR with interface non-AR influenced in indoor navigation of AR technology [6].
Navigation systems may use different identification methods. Approach of tracking to image
features without marker can use existing sensors on mobile devices [7]. The determination of location
where visitor been is very important in the navigation system type.
Vision-based localization can be used to navigate indoor environment [8]. The system will
recognize the location from sequence of images that are taken automatically in a room. To identify a
location, we need to make a pre-reconstruction of an image and use a model in a location database
which consists of location and path between the rooms. This system is a kind of client-server system.
A client which in this case can be a smartphone or other type of mobile device will take a few pictures
and send the images to the server to be processed through the network. After the checking process, it
will produce the relocation information that will be sent to the client. The determination of the location
using mobile devices may consist of several stages: feature extraction and description, matching
characteristics, determination optionally, removes the outermost points (outliers) and the last pose
calculation and smoothness.
Other museum navigation system that employs a robot has also been conducted. In this case the use
of the robot is combined with the use of augmented reality technology. The navigation uses interaction
with human-robot and location method to find position and orientation [9]. This type of AR museum
tour guide robot displays some elements as object virtual 3D, video and audio in the museum.

3. System Model
3.1. System Description
ARGuide is a guidance application for museum visitor. The architecture system of ARGuide can be
described in the Figure 1. The application is composed by core component such as: camera, image
converter, tracker, database, video render background, and application code.

Figure 1. Architecture of ARGuide.
In Figure 1, the process is started by taking point camera to the object. The application converts the
image into pixel format in order to AR is able to process it. Then it continues to the tracking process to
detect the object that has been matched in the cloud database. The results are stored in a state object
used by the video background renderer which can be accessed from the application code.
There are three modules in the application codes. They are query of the state object, update of the
application logic and render of graphics. Query of the state object processes newly detected targets,
markers or updated states of these elements. Update of the application logic is to input new data.
Render of graphics is to overlay and show the AR object.
ARGuide guides the museum visitors to get information about objects and location related to the
real situation of the museum. Museum Sonobudoyo Yogyakarta has 13 different rooms and 43.235
collections of historical and memorial objects. These objects are registered as image targets in Vuforia
Target Manager.
The application is created based on Vuforia SDK and use cloud database systems. There are two
types of databases used in the mobile phone: mobile database and cloud database. A mobile database
refers to a database embedded on a mobile device. Cloud database refers to computing resources in
clouds to provide mobile data services and applications [10]. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)
defined by [11] is “an emergent mobile cloud paradigm which leverage mobile computing,
networking, and cloud computing to study mobile service models, develop mobile cloud
infrastructures, platforms, and service applications for mobile clients.”
3.2. Flowchart
Workflow of ARGuide is described in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Flowchart of ARGuide.
As shown in Figure 2, this application is started with a welcome screen and a description about the
application. After the application is opened, user can choose either to continue or not. If the user
chooses not to close the application, the user can take point the camera to an object. If the recognizing
process is not success, the application will back to tracking process. If the object is successfully
recognized, the information will be displayed. The next step is user can choose either to close the
information or not. If the user chooses to close, the application backs to tracking process. Otherwise,
the user can choose either to touch button audio or not. Or else, the application will return to display
text information. But if the user chooses yes, the application renders the audio information and back to
welcome screen.
4. Testing and Result
Testing is conducted using different Android smartphone. The purpose of the testing is to determine
capabilities and tracking speed of the application to recognize the objects. For the testing, uses 33
different objects.

As shown in the Table I, the testing 1, the application has succeeded to recognize 23 objects. This is
about 69.70% of the objects. It is also shown that the response time of tracking process is in between 26 seconds. In the testing 2, success tracking is about 57.58% or 19 objects can be tracked successfully,
with response time between 3-12 seconds. There is significant difference between testing 1 and testing
2, which is approximately 12.12%. It is probably caused by the difference quality of camera and
internet connection. Quality of the camera influences quality of image and also tracking process. Based
on the observation, when the tracking process has been conducted, the display of picture tracking in
testing 2 is not as clear as in testing 1. The result of tracking in testing 2 is a less lighting. It makes the
tracking process of testing 2 slower than testing 1. The succeed tracking process can be described in
Figure 3.
In Figure 3, ARGuide is able to recognize objects in this museum, except in Prehistoric and Wayang
kulit room. It is caused by lighting of the room which is too bright. It makes some noise in image target,
so the application could not recognize the feature of the object. The features of the objects are not
match with the marker that has been registered in the database.
5. Conclusion
The average of succeed tracking of ARGuide application is about 63.64%. This application is an
unmarked AR technology using a real object as a marker. There is different result when the application
is implemented on different smartphone that have different capability of camera.
Other factors that affect the success of tracking are the quality of processor, internet
connection and lighting in the room. This application is not recommended for use in a dark or excessive
light environment. The use of sensors to get a real position of the visitors may be considered in the
future research.
