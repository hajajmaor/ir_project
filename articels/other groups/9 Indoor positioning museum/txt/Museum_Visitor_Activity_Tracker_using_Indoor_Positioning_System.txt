 Abstract
 Tourism is one of the sources of state revenue that has enormous potential, especially for developing countries. One of
 the great tourism potential is the museum. In displaying the artifacts and their information the museum manager has
 difficulty in recognizing the behavior of museum visitors such as the route chosen in seeing the artifacts presented,
 how long they have been at a location, what artifacts are of their interest, etc. This is quite difficult to do, especially
 with the many artifacts that exist in a museum. This research created an activity tracker system for museum visitors
 using the Indoor Positioning System by utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Signals from BLE beacons
 detected by museum visitors' smartphones are used as a reference to estimate the location of visitors using the
 trilateration method and the Kalman filter. This location data is then stored in a server to be information of the
 movement of visitors in the museum. Based on this information, museum managers can find out which locations are
 often / rarely visited by visitors and how long visitors spend at that particular location. According to the distance error
 testing that compare real location and calculation position, it shows that the average error distance is around 114.35
 cm. So, it can be concluded that the information obtained is sufficient to represent the position of the museum
 visitors. © 2019 IEEE.

    Each BLE beacon will emit a signal that can be received by
Bluetooth devices that are on the museum visitor's smartphone.
From the received BLE beacon signal strength, the application

This calculation is done by calculating the distance of the

the smartphone by looking at the signal strength of the BLE

to use trilateration and kalman filter. Then, information about

by a museum visitor's smartphone (Fig 3.). The application on
the smartphone will then send the beacon id to the server to
find out the location of the BLE beacon. The application will
then calculate the user's current approximate location based on
the strength of the BLE beacon signal that was successfully
obtained. The approximate location is then sent to the server
