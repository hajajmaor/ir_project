Abstract—Many features of 5G are definitely important to
the broadcasting service, including diverse content services such
as follow-me TV, video-on-demand, but also gaming, Virtual
reality (VR) and Augmented reality (AR) and many others.
Meanwhile, those services depend more and more on the user’s
position accuracy, especially in indoor environment. With the
increase of broadcasting data traffic indoors, to obtain a highly
accurate position is becoming a challenge because of the impact
of radio interference. In order to support a high-quality indoor
broadcasting service, a high-accuracy positioning, radiation-free,
and high-capacity communication system is urgently needed.
In this paper, a 5G indoor positioning system is proposed for
museums. It utilizes unlicensed visible light of the electromagnetic spectrum to provide museum visitors with high-accuracy
positioning, multiple forms of interaction services, and highresolution multimedia delivery on a mobile device. The geographic data and the location-related data integrated into the
5G New Radio (NR) waveform are detailed. A general-purpose
system architecture is provided and some basic techniques to
enhance system performance are also investigated. A prelimi-

I. I NTRODUCTION
N RECENT years, with the emergence of 5G technologies,
the convergence of 5G with broadcasting services may have
a much more transformative impact than expected [1]–[4]. The
5G forum white paper [5] pointed clearly that the next (5th )
generation wireless network provides a safer, more secure,
customizable and intelligent building network that reliably
delivers increased throughput (greater than 10Gbps) from
access points pervasively located within buildings, whilst minimizing interference and electromagnetic field exposure and
providing location accuracy from 10 m to less than 1 m for
80 % of occasions, and better than 1 m for indoors. With those
features, 5G will be essential for a myriad of new broadcasting services based on accurate location awareness and other
contextual information [6].
Meanwhile, the demand for mobile data broadcasting and
location-related broadcasting service in broadband networks is
rapidly increasing. According to the data from Cisco, it predicts that broadcasting data traffic will reach approximately
77 Exabytes per month by 2020, where 70% to 90% of
the overall data traffic will occur in indoor environments [7].
Apart from enjoying high-speed data broadcasting services like
4K live broadcasting, VR, AR, High Dynamic Range (HDR)
and high-definition (HD) video surveillance, people also
put much higher requirements for related location-based
services (LBS) [8]. According to the report in [9], there is
a minimum of 52.63% of frequently used devices with positioning capabilities, such as mobile phones, vehicle satellite
navigation, fitness devices, iWatch, iPod, iPad. These devices
with positioning capabilities facilitated the growth of the
location-related broadcasting services.
However, the accurate geographic data broadcasting is
not only relying on the characteristics of the up-link and
down-link signals but also on new technologies and network
configurations. For example, Global Navigation Satellite
Systems (GNSS) (e.g., BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and
GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN,

sensors etc. [9]. Although these non-3GPP technologies have
been widely used thanks to their low-cost, they cannot guarantee to provide satisfactory positioning resolution for 5G
network especially in the indoor environment where it is lack
of service coverage and poor accuracy.
In this context, this paper proposes an integrated solution
of indoor positioning systems and broadcasting service based
on Internet of Radio Light (IoRL) infrastructure [10]. Visible
Light Communication (VLC) system and VLC-based positioning method are adopted to fulfil the requirement in terms of
capacity and positioning accuracy with low-cost LED devices.
The proposed system is evaluated in a museum scenario and
will be deployed in the museum “Musée Nationale de la Carte
à Jouer” of Issy-les-moulineaux in Paris in June 2020.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as
follows:
1) The unified 5G NR signal is designed as the positioning
signal over VLC, the geographic data and the locationrelated data is in a unified 5G NR frame structure and
some special adaptations for the VLC case are studied.
Furthermore, the positioning procedure is also proposed
for the first time.
2) A real-time demonstration which has a data rate of
around 45.25 Mbps within a bandwidth of 10 MHz by
using 3.6 W LED lamp is implemented in laboratory.
The system supports an Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
less than 4% with different modulation scheme (QPSK,
16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM). In view of positioning performance, to the best of our knowledge, our
work is the first to demonstrate that by using 5G NR signal, VLC-based indoor positioning system can achieve
a mean positioning error of 0.18 m.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
highlights the related positioning technologies for broadcasting
services. Section III describes the location-based broadcasting applications for museum scenarios. The proposed system
architecture diagram together with the main components are
introduced in Section IV. Section V provides the definition
of the geographic data and the location-related data; the positioning procedure is also investigated. The proposed end user
applications for museums are introduced in Section VI. The
details of the demonstration setup and evaluation are presented
in Section VII. The system features and capabilities are illustrated in Section VIII. Section IX highlights the conclusions.
II. P OSITIONING T ECHNOLOGIES FOR
B ROADCASTING S ERVICES
This section reviews the various indoor positioning technologies for broadcasting services in recent years and their
drawbacks.
The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), as the
most widely used technology in the current 4G long term
evolution (LTE) standards, enables determining the outdoor
geographic location within few meters of accuracy and thus
supports lots of location-based broadcasting applications and
services [11] such as navigation, tracking and Location-Based
Social Networking. However, the GNSS cannot provide users

with the same level of positioning accuracy, continuity, and
reliability in the indoor environment due to the attenuation and reflection by buildings. To cope with this issue,
the research of emerging technologies for indoor positioning is on-going [12]–[22], for example, Wi-Fi [18], Frequency
Modulation (FM) broadcast technology (ex. digital television
terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB) [19]), Bluetooth [16], [20],
RFID [21], Ultra-wideband (UWB) [13]–[17], ZigBee [14],
etc. The advantages and disadvantages of these technologies
are compared in detail in [22]. Besides these well-known
positioning technologies, 5G proposes a number of promising
positioning technologies, which can be applied at mmWave
frequencies and which is a feasible solution in 5G era with
two advantages: 1) large available bandwidth to meet the
increasing demand for mobile data broadcasting; 2) the possibility to pack a large number of antenna elements in
smartphone or others mobile device. A large number of
antenna elements enables massive MIMO and high accurate
beamforming [23]. This is helpful for 2D/3D position and
3D orientation [24]. Although the mmWave-based positioning
technology can meet the positioning accuracy requirements
for the 5G LBS, the high time resolution required from
the mmWave-based positioning system needs a high synchronization clocking source with extreme low phase noise
and the cost of mmWave frontend is still considerably high.
Compared with these Radio-Frequency (RF) solutions mentioned above, the advantages of visible light technology
include achieving high positioning accuracies, high transmission capacity, interference-free while maintaining a low
deployment cost [25], [26], [28], [29]. Apart from that, VLCbased positioning system can be a reasonable alternative to
those RF-based positioning systems in some RF prohibited
areas such as hospitals, aircraft cabins and oil plants [30].
In general, the current VLC applications are very rich and
broad, with opportunities in the most diverse areas. High speed
transmission and high accuracy indoor positioning are the most
widely discussed among these areas. Orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing (OFDM) is most extensively used in
VLC systems to achieve high-speed transmission, because
of its high spectral efficiency and low-complexity implementation. Gigabit transmissions using OFDM-based VLC have
recently been achieved and reported [31], [32]. For example,
10 Gb/s is achieved by using a GaN violet micro-LED [31].
Apart from OFDM, multiple channel multiplexing techniques
such as wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) has been
used to realize high speed data rate goal. Reference [33], [34]
reported WDM with the use of RGB laser diodes (LD) demonstrating the rate of 8 Gb/s and 14 Gb/s, respectively. However
most importantly from the positioning perspective, visible
light-based systems have the ability to estimate an object’s
position at the accuracy within the centimeter range [36].
For example, according the summary about the state-of-theart of indoor VLP in [37], the highest positioning accuracy
is proposed by [38], in which a positioning accuracy of
0.69cm is achieved in an indoor environment of 4m x 4m
x 6m by using differential evolution algorithm. These attractive performance data illustrate that visible light technology
is a promising candidate for serving the high data rate as

well as positioning accuracy demands of 5G communication
systems.
Our proposition is based on the IoRL framework,
which is a typical indoor solution that integrates VLCbased positioning system into 5G network with Intelligent
Home IP Gateway (IHIPGW) and Software Defined
Networks (SDN)/Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
network paradigm and which provides Virtual Network
Functions (VNFs). It is structured in four layers including
the service layer, NFV layer, SDN layer, and the access
layer. The system architecture is shown in Fig. 1. IoRL is
also compatible with existing system/standards, e.g., IEEE
802.11, 802.15, 3GPP. There are two main benefits namely
delivering a total of 10Gbs data rates in a building with
a latency under 1ms for future 5G broadcasting service; providing location sensing services with sub 10cm accuracy for
upcoming indoor 5G era. This is made possible by modulating a high-powered communication LED within the existing
lighting infrastructure for VLC. Furthermore, we investigated
the reuse of the same Transport Blocks of 5G NR and adding
some improvements/adaptation for the VLC case. This may
simplify and reduce prices of the terminals and the access
points. All the above-mentioned capabilities have brought
great motivation for VLC research in 5G networks.
The intention of the proposed system is to employ
a location-based broadcasting VNF based on IoRL framework
into museum scenarios to provide an improved Quality of
Experience (QoE) and a high accuracy LBS by using low-cost
VLC-based positioning technology.
III. L OCATION -BASED B ROADCASTING A PPLICATIONS
FOR M USEUM S CENARIOS
The museum as a typical scenario for indoor broadband
and broadcasting systems, which has attracted more and more

attention in recent years. It requires to display position and
direction on a map of the mobile device and broadcasts also
the corresponding information about its surroundings, closeby objects, or time to destination. There are three typical
requirements for the geographic data broadcasting.
A. Indoor Location-Based Data Access
Research in [39] applies iBeacon technology in museums to
provide visitors with indoor location-based data access. With
the aid of the geographic data information, staff members of
museums can provide the exhibit’s information to immediately
inform the museum visitors. However, this system can only
provide the rough estimation of the position (between 3 and
5 meters).
B. Indoor Location Monitoring and Guiding
Research in [40] investigated to implement a museum
monitoring and guiding application using Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) beacon.
The visitor’s position is calculated by BLE beacon signal strength (RSS) at the location server. The server then
broadcasts the information about the artifact near the visitor’s
location through the Internet. Even as the location accuracy
has been improved in [40] compared to [39], visitors need
additional connected readers to obtain higher location accuracy (around 2 meters). This method is not convenient for
visitors.
Another example is the “Smart Museum” system proposed
in [41], where Near-field communication (NFC) and RadioFrequency Identification (RFID) technologies are used for
indoor localization. However, this solution is required to install
RFID readers on mobile devices, which are expensive and not
convenient.

5G IoRL positioning system architecture diagram.

C. Interaction Between Visitors and Systems
Research in [42] presented a simulation framework for
a location-based VR museum, which is a RF-based location
system operating in the Gigahertz band. However, there is no
practical demonstration based on their simulation.
The limitation of the aforementioned works is that they cannot provide satisfactory positioning accuracies required for
future broadcasting service. To deal with the limitation and
meet all requirements above, a high accuracy 5G positioning
system using VLC is presented in the next section.
IV. S YSTEM A RCHITECTURE D IAGRAM
This section details the 5G IoRL positioning system architecture presented in Fig. 2. The architecture consists of two
subsystems: the networking and services subsystem and the
radio access network subsystem (5G RAN). Both parts are
connected together through a 10Gbps enhanced Common
Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) Ethernet ring.
The networking and services subsystem consist of the Cloud
Home Data Center Server (CHDCS) and IHIPGW, which
incorporate with the NFV technologies offering a flexible
infrastructure.
The 5G RAN subsystem consists of the Remote Radio Light
Head Controllers (RRLHC), the VLC RRLHs (LEDs) and
UE. The number of RRLHC (N) depends on the number of
rooms in building. The number of VLC RRLH (n) depends
on the number of LEDs required in one room. There can be
any number of UEs in a room.
In summary, there are four main components relevant to
location in these two subsystems: the location server (LS),
the location database (LD) in the IHIPG, the RRLH controller (RRLHC) in the RAN and the location service
client (LSC) in the UE.
• The LS is a VNF implemented within the IHIPGW to
estimate the coordinates of UE;
• The LD is another VNF implemented within the
IHIPGW. There are three different sets of parameters
stored in the LD:
1) Received signal strength (RSS) of the geographic
data obtained by UE within geographic coverage
area of a room;

•

•

2) Estimated coordinates of UE;
3) Coordinates of all LEDs and floor plans.
RRLHC is used to transmit geographic data with known
power, where one RRLHC is responsible for signal
dissemination within one room;
The LSC is a software application (e.g., indoor location monitoring and guiding application) inside both the
UE and the CHDCS. It provides position information for
monitoring, guiding and interactive applications (ex. VR
gaming application) in the form of RSS measurements.
V. G EOGRAPHIC DATA , L OCATION -R ELATED DATA ,
AND P OSITIONING P ROCEDURE IN M USEUM

A. The Geographic Data and the Location-Related
Data Integration in 5G NR Frame
Each geographic data represents one LED’s ID. This ID is
generated by 5G RAN and broadcasted through VLC link.
The geographic data and location-related data are integrated
in 5G NR frame, which is illustrated in Fig. 3. They are
allocated in the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH)
slots. In each slot, the 3rd to 10th OFDM symbols are used to
transmit the location-related data such as the multimedia contents about the close-by exhibitions. The last four OFDM
symbols transmit four geographic data, where only one particular subcarrier frequency f is used to carry the respective
geographic data. Since one time slot duration is 0.5 ms, each
data is obtained by UE every 36 us (0.5 ms/14) at least.
In the next subsection, the indoor positioning procedure will
be presented.
B. Indoor Positioning Procedure
The indoor positioning procedure involves interaction
between RRLHC, LD, LS, LSC and the UE, which is illustrated in Fig. 4.
1) Measurement of Location Relevant Parameters (See the
Red Lines in Fig. 4):
a. The UE sends the positioning request to the RRLHC;
b. The RRLHC sequentially broadcasts a series of LEDs’
IDs at Time Division Multiplex (TDM) mode;
c. The UE receives the IDs from all LEDs in one room
and reports them to the LD by using TCP/IP packages.

Geographic data broadcasting and positioning procedure.

2) Position Estimation (See Blue Lines):
a. The LS retrieves the latest IDs data and coordinates of
corresponding LED from the LD to perform the UE’s
position estimation;
b. The LS writes the UE’s position estimation results to
the LD.
3) Exploitation of Position Estimation:
a. The LSC provides location-related broadcasting service
to user by retrieving the UE’s position estimation from
the LD.
C. VLC Positioning Algorithm
Common positioning algorithms used for VLC indoor localization systems are based on the triangulation method, and
they need to estimate the distance or angle between transmitter and receiver. There are many ways to achieve the
distance or angle such as received signal strength (RSS) [25],
[43], time of arrival (TOA) [14], [27], time difference of
arrival (TDOA) [30], and angle of arrival (AOA) [44].

AOA positioning algorithm can achieve high accuracy, but
it needs to deploy a sensor array, which is very expensive
for users. On the other hand, the TOA or TDOA method is
a positioning algorithm based on transmission time. However,
TOA requires the transmitted signals to be very accurately
synchronized. The need for accurate transmitter synchronization can be avoided if TDOA [45] rather than TOA is
used. However, the short distance between transmitter and
the receiver results in short transmission time in indoors.
Thus, extremely accurate time measurement is required. On
the contrary, RSS does not need high accuracy synchronization and high frequency clocking compared to the TOA and
TDOA methods. Furthermore, VLC RSS parameters are easy
to obtain using a single photodetector without the need for
auxiliary devices. To take the cost, complexity and accuracy
of indoor positioning into consideration, RSS based positioning is preferred due to its low cost, low complexity and high
accuracy [25].
Therefore, this section elaborates the RSS positioning
algorithm in our proposition. Based on RSS triangulation

positioning algorithm, minimum three LED’s ID signal power
should be registered for estimating UE’s position. In the example shown in Fig. 5, three LED’s ID signal f1, f2 and f3 are
the dedicated subcarrier frequencies with the three highest
received power. Therefore, the distance d between the LED
and UE can be calculated by using equation (1)

where Ar is the effective area of the receiving surface of the

denoted as ϕ 1/2 .

To demonstrate the performance requirements for broadcasting the geographic data mentioned in Section III, three
different applications are developed as following.
A. Location-Based Data Access Application

where PT is the transmitted light power of LED. H (0) is VLC
Line of Sight (LOS) channel gain between the LED and UE
which can be shown as:
(m + 1)Ar cosm (ϕ)cosm (θ )
(4)
H(0) =
2πd2
where ϕ is the radiation angle between the LED and the UE,
and θ is the angle of light incident to the receiving surface of
the UE.
Thus, the distance d1 , d2 and d3 can be obtained
respectively.
The projection distance r1 , r2 , and r3 between LED and UE
is expressed as shown below:

(5)
r = d2 − h2

As shown in Fig. 6, it allows the museum to deliver the
specific description of the demonstrated objects to the visitors nearby yet within exhibition room. The application is
able to view exhibits from the location database. The location database has been designed using Django architecture.
The application requires the use of a database and an interface
that will interact with the VLC access points and the database.
Essentially the VLC access points would from now on lookup
the data from the database, and the application developer
would be able to access and edit the information in this
database (see Fig. 7), making it easier to manage and control
the application.

The estimated coordinates of UE: Xe (xe , ye ) thus can be
calculated as follows:
⎧
⎨ (xe − x1 )2 + (ye − y1 )2 = r12
(6)
(x − x2 )2 + (ye − y2 )2 = r22
⎩ e
(xe − x3 )2 + (ye − y3 )2 = r32

Monitoring application see Fig. 8, allows the museum to
record the behavior of visitors listed below for further analysis.
• The visitor’s path through the museum;
• The amount of time individual visitor spent at each
exhibit;
• The most visited exhibit;
• The population density of visitors in the museum at
any time.
According to the definition of LBS, LBS systems use realtime geo-data from a mobile device or smartphone to provide

where, (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ) and (x3 , y3 ) are the known coordinates of three LED respectively. Equation (6) can be formed
in a matrix format as (7)

information, entertainment or security and to improve user
experience. For the museum scenarios, our solution allows the
visitors to access to a floor plan of the museum to help the
visitor to navigate around it, as shown in Fig. 9.
As visitors move around the museum from exhibit to
exhibit, the location of each visitor is estimated by RSS
measurements and constantly updated on the user application
database. The monitoring & guiding application then accesses
the user application database and retrieves appropriate LED’s
ID that covers that visitor. The downlink packets destined for
specific visitor are then broadcasted by his serving LED and
received by the corresponding visitor. Moreover, at the same
time, a database records their behaviors, namely: the time each
visitor spends at each exhibit, their path through the museum,
the density of visitors in the museum at any one time etc. for
analysis by the museum management and for increasing the
user experience.
C. Interaction Application
Interaction can enhance the visitor user experience where
the museums provide their exhibitions with massive bespoke
digital information only through the individual visitors’ request
including VR or AR applications [46].
Once the received geographic raw data in the LD has been
processed by the positioning algorithm in the LS to determine
the UE’s geographic position, it can then be used by user
applications. The VR application can now retrieve this data to

determine the user’s physical movements and thus their position in the virtual environment. The process of the position
data dissemination is illustrated in the green line of Fig. 10.
The procedure involves the mobile application sending out
a request to the LD on the IHIPGW via the RRLHC. The
location data is then outputted from the LD back to the
application.

The demonstration is performed in a practical indoor environment and its feasibility has been shown through experiments, as shown in Fig. 11. This system is quite simple in
composition and does not require any additional installation.
There are four commercial LEDs installed on the ceiling
to broadcast the geographic data. Each LED is connected
to a VLC modulator. A Silicon avalanche photodetector (Hamamatsu APD C5331-11) is used as the VLC
receiver [47]. Related parameters of LED and of APD can
be found in Table I.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BROADCASTING

The demonstration of the 5G Internet of Radio Light positioning system in the laboratory environment.

At the Tx, one Dell server R740 acts as the 5G NR transmitter and generates 5G baseband signals. The user data is
modulated with different modulation schemes that include
QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM. The modulated
symbols are then assigned to the PDSCH of the 5G NR frame.
After that, inverse Fast Fourier transform (IFFT) processing is
applied to convert the OFDM frame to the time-domain. In
addition, the 5G NR baseband signal is complex-valued data,
to guarantee that the time-domain signal is real-valued in the
IM/DD VLC system, IQ modulation is adopted. Subsequently,
the time-domain discrete signal is scaled and passed through
a digital-analog (D/A) converter by using USRP 2944R. Then,
a DC bias is added to ensure the signal is in the quasilinear range of LED. At the end, the signal can be transmitted
over VLC.
At the receiver side, the VLC signal is received by APD
and digitized by analog-digital (A/D) converter of USRP
2944R. After receiving data from USRP, a UE Layer 1 processing software is used to do the Fast Fourier transform (FFT)
and OFDM demodulation to recover the data from timedomain to frequency-domain. It estimates the channel response
with pilot signal in PDSCH and uses zero forcing equalizer
to recover the symbols. After that, it calculates the EVM and
positioning error.

B. Evaluation of the Demo
1) Communication Performance: The demonstration can
work well with white LED lamp in a normal laboratory indoor
lighting environment. The system can provide a data rate of

around 45.25 Mbps with a bandwidth of 10 MHz from 10 MHz
to 20 MHz.
The constellation diagrams of the received signal as well
as the signal’s Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) are measured for QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM modulation schemes, as shown in Fig. 12. The system supports an EVM less than 4% with those kinds of schemes
and their constellation points are concentrated, which means
that our system has a good communication link quality and ensures the probability of successful demodulation. In addition, QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM can meet
the 3GPP EVM recommendation: EVMQPSK < 17.5%,
EVM16−QAM < 12.5%, and EVM64−QAM < 8% which are
illustrated in Table 6.5.2-1 in [48]. The EVM of the 256-QAM
and 3GPP recommendation in this modulation scheme are also
extremely close.
2) Positioning Accuracy: Four single-tone signals are used
to represent the geographic data of four LEDs’ ID: 300 kHz,
600 kHz, 900 kHz and 1200 kHz with −3 dBm transmitter
power. The positioning accuracy is evaluated by the PE defined
in equation (11) as follows:

(11)
PE = (xe − xr )2 + (ye − yr )2
where xr , yr and xe , ye are the coordinates of the reference
points and estimated points, respectively.
We plot the distribution of reference points and estimated
points in Fig. 13 (a). Under the experimental environment,
6*11 uniform distributed reference points are selected over
the positioning area. Each reference point is measured 5 times
thus there are 330 (6*11*5) estimated points in total.

Fig. 12. The measured constellation diagrams of the received signal for proposed system (left upper corner: QPSK, left lower corner: 16-QAM, right upper
corner: 64-QAM, right lower corner: 256-QAM).

The distribution of PEs is illustrated in Fig. 13 (b). Although
there are significant PEs especially in the room corners, it
obtains a good positioning performance in the room center.
This can be explained by its sensitivity due to the light reflection. 75% of room coverage can achieve the PEs of less than
0.25 m.
Fig. 13 (c) plots the PEs distribution of five ranges.
According to the results, our system has a probability of
60.2 % to achieve a PE less than 0.2m and only 15.8 % to have
PEs in the range 0.3-0.4m. Thus, we can say that our proposal
can guarantee a reasonable high-accuracy positioning ability.

VIII. S YSTEM F EATURES AND C APABILITIES

B. High-Capacity
The high-capacity can be illustrated in the following aspects:
1) a wide capacity is guaranteed by designing of LED’s layout;
2) many spectrally efficient modulation formats cooperation
with different digital signal processing techniques could provide the high-capacity. For example, wavelength division
multiplexing (WDM) could support multiple users with different colors LED [49], space division multiple access (SDMA)
could create parallel spatial pipes by differing spatial locations of the users and hence improve the capacity [50]. All
these aspects enable users to seamlessly access the Internet
while keeping high Quality of service (QoS) levels, avoiding
network congestions and delays.

The proposed system inherits the advantages of VLC-based
positioning system and meanwhile overcomes some shortcomings in current positioning systems, such as the low-accuracy
by using the radio beacon, high-cost of mmWave frontend and
so on. The features and capabilities of this system in museum
scenario can be summarized as follows.

C. Radiation-Free

A. High-Accuracy

D. Low-Cost

This system provides a reasonable high positioning accuracy
with a mean PEs of 0.18 m obtained by single-tone training
signals. It allows visitors to match precisely their geographic
location to the surrounding location-related information.

The cost is lower because the VLC uses the existing lighting
infrastructure to communicate and illuminate without additional installation, and the cost of the VLC front-end is only
a LED lamp price with a small LED driver.

With LED Lamp, the system utilizes unlicensed visible light
which has no radiation and no interference issues to broadcast
geographic data. Based on this feature, the system and the
broadcasting service can be applied more widely in indoor
environment.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BROADCASTING

A demonstration with white LED lamps and commercial
APD shows that the system has a high data rate of around
45.25 Mbps in the laboratory environment and a mean PEs
of 0.18 m. Besides that, the system has many other excellent
features, such as high communication bandwidth, low-cost,
radiation-free etc., so we do believe that the system can be
widely used in the future in different indoor broadcasting
service scenarios such as museums, shopping centers etc.
Moreover, based on these experimental results obtained in
this paper, we summarized the key points of future work in
order to improve system performance. First of all, as for the
RSS-based VLC indoor positioning systems, many research
works demonstrated that the calibration during offline preparation can improve the positioning accuracy [51]. Thus, our next
work should focus on this and carefully analyze the effect on
positioning accuracy and adopt appropriate calibration method
in our system.
Secondly, the positioning errors have been measured to
be relatively high on the edges, or corners, of the experimental environment. This may be caused by the multipath
effect [12], [52]. Therefore, in order to boost the positioning
accuracy, it is absolutely necessary to analyze the characteristics of practical indoor optical wireless channel in near
future.
Thirdly, the current experimental results are based on RSS
positioning algorithm and we will try to analyze and compare the performance of various positioning algorithms under
the same experimental condition in our laboratory. These
more comprehensive experimental results will be obtained and
reported in the future.
Finally, to guarantee a high positioning accuracy, one technology will not be enough because of the complex indoor
environment. It is necessary to propose an enhanced positioning system in the near future that fuses different positioning
data to compensate for some inherent defect of visible light
(such as impassable via opaque obstacles).
