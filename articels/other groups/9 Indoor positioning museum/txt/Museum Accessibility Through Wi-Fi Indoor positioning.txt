allow for example to display content when the user is exactly
in front of an artwork. In fact, our system may integrate
BLE measurements if present, and we are currently starting
to experiment with this technology as a complement to the
present deployment.
   Another possibility would be to use some of the several sen-
sors that are commonly integrated nowadays in most end user
devices. For example, the accelerometer and the gyroscope
could also be useful to improve the localization. They can also
be helpful to identify for example where the user is looking
at. For this purpose the camera could also be useful, also
allowing the artworks’ recognition with a suitable previously
trained algorithm. A problem with most of these sensors is
that they are typically not very accurate and there is a huge
variability among different devices, so the integration could
be quite challenging.
