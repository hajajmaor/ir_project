Abstract: As modern mobile devices are often equipped with a WLAN interface and many buildings are equipped with
a WLAN infrastructure, WLAN could be used for localization. The aim of this work is to investigate the quality of
different indoor positioning methods based on values of WLAN received signal strength index (RSSI) using
commercially available devices (smart phones, personal digital assistants). Three positioning algorithms were
considered: minimal Euclidian distance, intersections of RSSI-Isolines and a stochastic model based on Bayes' theorem.
A measuring test bed within an empty seminar room, four different types of personal digital assistants (Dell, Fujitsu,
HP, T-Mobile) and two types of access points (Netgear, Lancom) were used. No modification of hardware and software
was conducted. Furthermore this paper shows how WLAN localization can be applied in a museum guide application.
This paper also shows the visualization of spatial user position frequency pattern during a field trial within a museum.

    For using the method of ISOLINES a network
of triangles having calibration points as nodes is
developed (Delaunay-Triangulation, see [11]).
Given a recorded RSSI value of one access point
we can select triangles whose nodes show signal
strength values higher and lower than the recorded
value. Linear interpolation between node values
within the triangle delivers a detailed radio map
consisting of a surface of interpolated RSSI values
over the triangle. Moreover, we calculate an
