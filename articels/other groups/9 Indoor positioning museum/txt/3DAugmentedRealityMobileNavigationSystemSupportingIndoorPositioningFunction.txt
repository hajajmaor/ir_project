pictures as the images to be attached to the model in order to
enhance the sense of reality. After the models of all of
buildings were completed, they were converted into FBX files
and integrated into Unity. In Unity, after it was certain that the
materials of images to be attached onto the buildings were
correctly connected; more scenes and objects would be added
into the system. In addition, natural materials (e.g. sky, tree,
etc.) would be timely added as well. In the end, light effects
would be added to beautify the models and scenes (as shown in
Figure 4). Furthermore, after the self-compiled interactive
program was added to the models, a 3D mobile navigation
system, with the effect of realistic scenes and interactive
functions, was completed.
