this information to the server, determining that the visitor was in
proximity to that known location. While providing a reasonable
indoor positioning solution, the system’s major weakness is that it
only knows when a person is in proximity to a Beacon, not being
able to detect positioning in transition from one Beacon to
another. Thus, the system provides sporadic rather than
continuous movement data. A research prototype of a location-
aware mobile museum guide was developed and then converted
into a working museum visitors’ guide. The guide was handed off
to regular museum visitors visiting the museum over a period of
10 months. Log data was gathered for analysis. A total of 423
