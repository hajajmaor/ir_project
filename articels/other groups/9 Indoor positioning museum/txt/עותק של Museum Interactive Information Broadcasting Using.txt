                         I. INTRODUCTION
    Tourism industry has a big potential as a contributor to
Indonesian revenue. This is very important especially for
developing countries which generally cannot rely on country
revenue from technological or industrial capabilities.
Developing countries generally get their revenue from natural
resources and human resources which are relatively cheaper
than developed countries. The problem is this exploration of
natural resources is limited and can be run out. This is different
compared to the tourism. Tourism is one thing that cannot be
exhausted as long as it is managed properly.
    Indonesia as a developing country also has a similar
problem. The largest country revenues from oil and gas, coal,
and coal and palm oil (CPO). Therefore, the Indonesian                          Fig. 1. Monthly Foreigner Tourist Data 2017 vs. 2016 [4]
