    Shared Presence Prerequisite

• Need to detect, transmit and represent:
  – Individual context
  – Social context

               Context
“Any information that can be used to
characterize the situation of an entity. An
entity is a person, place, or object that is
considered relevant to the interaction
between a user and an application, including
the user and application themselves”

                  [Dey and Abowd, 2000]

                  Social Context
• Who is in the social group
• Group characteristics (e.g. cohesiveness)
• Group member characteristics (e.g. friendship, leadership,
  role, dominance)
• Interpersonal characteristics (e.g. being polite, heaving
  empathy, arguing)
• Current status (e.g. involved in conversation)
• History of relations

        Research Environment

• The research is conducted in Museums
• Exploring ways to measure museum visitors
  behavior, analyze it, and suggest smart
  services to the visitors
• One important aspect, that can influence
  these services is the social context of the
  museum visitors

     Museums – Social Activity




The overwhelming percentage of visitors come in
groups — usually with families or friends …
Consequently, museum visitation is, to a large extent,
a social experience
                                    [Bitgood, 2002]

     Sensors at the Hecht Museum
              (PIL Project)
•   Proximity to a stationary point (RFID, signal strength)
•   Proximity to a mobile device (RFID, signal strength)
•   Orientation (magnetometers)
•   Voice detection (microphone)
•   Motion detection (accelerometers)




                                                              22
    Requirements from a Positioning
               System
• We would like positioning data to be:
  – Precise
  – Accurate
  – Continuous
  – Complete
  – Error free
• This is not the case for indoor positioning


                                                23
       Can Social Behavior Assist in
              Positioning?


If A is near B, the position of A is unknown and
   the position of B is known, we may be able to
   infer the position of A from the position of B

                     Test Case
• 13 small groups ( 4 groups of 3, 9 pairs)
• Museum visit time 35 – 135 minutes (64 minutes
  average)
• 113,441 messages
• 10.1% were proximity messages (0.7% proximity to
  two other people) . Out of them:
  – Only 21% had positioning reports
  – Mutual positioning added 7.8% , an increase of 37% in
    regards to the available positioning messages


                                                            26
                      Discussion
• Mutual positioning decreases accuracy
• Increased quality of service and coverage would contribute to
  proximity assessment (if the position is accurate and
  continuous then the proximity is known too)
• Proximity would contribute in cases of decreased quality of
  service and coverage
• Spatiotemporal separation of group members decreases the
  chances for mutual positioning, and being joint increases
  them
• Crowding may increase the chances for mutual positioning,
  while adding interferences
• Complementary social factors such as conversation and
  orientation may help in assessing proximity


                                                                  27
                  Conclusions

• Where you are and whom you are with are equally
  important in order to share contexts in mixed reality

• Positioning may contribute to proximity detection
  and vice versa
