                                                                        Having carried out measurements on a 1mx1m grid

                                                                        Figure 3 presents the median location estimation

   From the figure it can be seen that the base station
oriented approach has a smaller location estimation
error that the direction based approach. The median
location estimation error lies at 2.12m for the base
station oriented approach and 3.04m for the heading
based approach. With the heading based approach 95%
of location estimation errors are below 16m while the
base station oriented approach shows 95% location
estimation errors below 9.25m.
   Furthermore, it can be seen that the moving median
filter reduces median location estimation error as well
as the number of highly incorrect estimations. With
