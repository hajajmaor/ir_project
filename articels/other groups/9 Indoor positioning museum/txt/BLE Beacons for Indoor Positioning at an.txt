laboratory, the beacon transmits in a large area, away from

between the beacon and the smartphone for most of the time,
due to the limited space.

    When all the RSSI values were collected, a curve fitting for
the path loss was performed for the laboratory and the corridor,
shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, respectively. It is clear that the
two environments experience noise and interference due to
other beacon transmissions in the area as well as the general
construction of the environment and people’s movement. The
path loss component, n in Eq. (1), for the laboratory was
calculated as n = 2.208 with A = −68.99 and the corridor as
n = 2.341 with A = −62.94. According to the experimental

is expected that the performance of the system, in terms of
