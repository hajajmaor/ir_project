ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES IN THEIR RURAL SETTINGS: STRATEGIES

The relationship between archaeological sites and their immediate surroundings has
long been debated, resulting in a shift of focus from the archeological vestiges alone
to the physical and social environment in which they are located. In this context,
emphasis has formerly been placed on the understanding of problems and potentials
of archaeological sites located in urban areas; while, on the other hand, the relationship
between archaeological sites and rural landscapes and settlements awaits further
investigation.
This study thus aims to investigate the co-existence of archaeological sites and rural
settlements as integral components of rural landscapes through a selected case study,
i.e. Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık, and is developed in three stages: the formation of a theoretical
framework, mainly including the identification of the nature of rural areas and
conservation of archaeological heritage; a detailed analysis and evaluation of the case
study with its different settlement phases and components; and the development of
proposals and strategies for the integrated conservation of the archaeological heritage
in its rural setting.
The selected study area, Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık, is a significant example reflecting the
close physical and socio-economic relationship between an archaeological site and its

v

rural setting. Such an intricate relationship inevitably produces a series of values,
threats and opportunities affecting the conservation of both the archaeological site and
its rural setting. Kıyıkışlacık is located on the site of the Iasian necropolis, making use
of some archeological remains, mainly the chamber tombs. On the one hand, this
overlapping location and architectural reuse provides some sort of protection for the
archaeological remains, while on the other hand, it causes problems of and threats to
the conservation, presentation and management of the archaeological site as a whole.
In this context, this study analyzes the values, threats and opportunities generated by
this intertwined relationship between the archaeological site and its rural setting in
order to offer a series of proposals and strategies for the integrated conservation of
Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık within its physical and socio-economic environment. .

Arkeolojik alanlar ve çevreleri arasındaki ilişki uzun zamandır kültürel mirasın
korunması alanında yürütülen çalışmalara konu olmuştur. Süreç içerisinde odak,
arkeolojik kalıntılardan, içerisinde bulundukları fiziksel ve sosyal çevreye kaymıştır.
Bu kapsamda çalışmalar, kentsel çevrelerde bulunan arkeolojik miras alanlarının
problem ve potansiyellerinin incelenmesine odaklanmıştır ve kırsal peyzajlarda
bulunan arkeolojik miras alanlarında araştırmalar kısıtlıdır.
Bu bağlamda tez, arkeolojik alanlar ve kırsal yerleşimlerin bir aradalığının doğal
yapısına odaklanan üç aşamalı bir araştırma yürütmektedir. İlk aşamada kırsallık ve
arkeolojik mirasın korunması üzerinden teorik bir çerçeve belirlenmiş, ikinci aşamada
örnek bir çalışma alanı üzerinden analiz ve değerlendirme çalışmaları yürütülmüş,
üçüncü aşamada ise yapılan değerlendirmeler kapsamında bütünleşik koruma
yaklaşımı için politika ve stratejiler üretilmiştir.
Örnek çalışma alanı olarak seçilen Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık yerleşimi, arkeolojik alanlar ve
kırsal yerleşimler arasında kurulan fiziksel, ekonomik ve sosyo-kültürel ilişkileri
yansıtması açısından önem taşımaktadır. Kıyıkışlacık, Iasos antik yerleşiminin
nekropolü üzerinde kurulmuş ve mezar odalarının kalıntılarını kullanmakta olan bir

vii

kırsal yerleşimdir. Iasos kentinin kalıntıları Kıyıkışlacık köyünün kırsal kimliğinin bir
parçası haline gelmiştir. Kırsal yerleşimin arkeolojik miras üzerinde yerleşmiş olması,
kalıntıların belirli bir ölçüde korunmuş olmasını sağlamışsa da, alanın korunması,
sunumu ve yönetimi konusunda bir takım problemlere de yol açmaktadır. Bu
çalışmanın amacı, Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık örneği üzerinden kırsal yerleşimlerin ve
arkeolojik miras alanlarının bir aradalığından doğan değer, tehdit ve problemlerin
analiz edilmesidir. Bu bağlamda analiz sonuçları değerlendirilmiş, bütünleşik koruma
yaklaşımı kapsamında stratjiler üretilmiştir..

INTRODUCTION

Since Anatolia has witnessed the passing of several civilizations, starting from the
prehistoric period, there are numerous archeological heritage sites in Turkey, and
some of these have universal importance due to their documentary value in the history
of humanity. Both urban and rural settlements formed on and around the remains of
ancient cities due to the process of location selection in the search for an advantageous
geographical and topographical location. In this manner, the present day rural
landscape of Turkey hosts a considerable part of the archeological heritage sites in the
country. In fact, the relationship between archeological remains and rural settlements
are quite unique in terms of their local values when compared to the urban areas.
Rural settlements are the centerpieces of rural landscapes on a larger scale, as the
indicators of an area of interaction between humans and the natural environment. The
indigenous formations of rural settlements derive their characteristics from the
integration of humans with nature, and the resulting physical environments become
shaped through this process of integration. As such, archeological heritage sites are
also integral parts of the rural identity of the settlements. Therefore, understanding the
integrity of archeological sites and rural settlements with their site specific values,
problems and threats, is a crucial prerequisite in the conservation of both the rural
identity and archeological heritage.
The relationship between archeological remains and rural settlements can be defined
as organic, as it is formed by the needs of local communities living in a specific
geographical setting. Thus, understanding the unique interaction between
archeological sites and rural settlements is crucial and it emphasizes the need for a
local, detailed analysis of each specific case.

1.1. Problem Definition
“The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single
architectural work but also the urban or rural setting which is found the
evidence of a particular civilization, a significant document or a historic
event.”2
The significance of the relationship between archaeological sites and their immediate
surroundings has long been debated, resulting in a shift of focus from the archeological
remains alone to the physical and social environment in which they are located. In this
context, emphasis has been placed on an understanding of the problems and potentials
of archaeological sites in urban areas; while the relationship between archaeological
sites and rural settlements still awaits further investigation.
Archeological sites within rural settlements have been dealt with in different ways.
Initially, the focus was placed on the archeological heritage only, without any concern
regarding the surrounding rural setting with its physical and socio-cultural
components. However, the focus then began to shift towards the environmental scale,
with resulting changes in conservation approaches, and archeological sites starting to
take into consideration their physical and socio-cultural environments. Even so, this
new perspective resulted in neglect, especially regarding archeological sites without
any potential for generating income in terms of touristic activities, such as these
located in remote rural landscapes3. In fact, archeological sites in rural landscapes
were left to the organic development process of rural settings. In the words of the
renowned photographer Ara Güler in describing the relation of the archeological site
of Aphrodisias and the village of Geyre as “History and today was living together. I
have not seen such an interesting place in my life. Ruin is a ruin. But that was
something different. That was a settlement living within its history”4. As a result of
the lack of interest by the Turkish government, an organic approach towards
archeological sites has been developed by local communities living in nearby rural

settlements. These approaches are shaped by the basic needs of the community, as
well as their awareness regarding cultural heritage. Such approaches have
paradoxically resulted in both the loss of archeological values and the conservation of
remains at some level.
However, archeological remains, as an integral part of rural identities, have been
threatened not only by excessive use and lack of appropriate conservation policies, but
also by two-way population movements into and out of rural settlements. As a
consequence, rural identities face the risk of losing their social values from migrations
both to urban areas, and from urban areas to rural settlements5. This leads to the
conservation of archeological heritage in rural settlements encountering several issues.
Therefore, the integrated conservation of archeological sites and rural settlements
stands out as a crucial issue in rural development and planning studies. Considering
different cases, there is a growing interest in rural settlements in current conservation
approaches. However, rural settlements and their relations with archeological heritage
sites, by their nature, have indigenous characteristics with physical, socio-cultural and
economic components, and different sets of values and problems are produced
according to their unique formation.

1.2. Aim and Scope of the Thesis
Within the framework outlined above, this thesis aims at developing an understanding
of the results of the organic relations between archeological sites and their rural
settings in a quest to develop a comprehensive conservation approach towards each
and every cultural value. In order to determine the main principles and strategies for
the conservation of archeological heritage in rural settings, it is proposed to analyze
and evaluate the values, threats and potentials emerging from this integration. Thus,

5

rather than the archeological heritage itself alone, rural settlements are also at the focus
of this study by virtue of their integration within a determined physical context.
As each rural settlement is unique in terms of its site-specific characteristics shaped
through local circumstances such as geographical conditions, natural resources and
existence of a specific community, conservation approaches to the archeological sites
in rural settlements should also be developed distinctively. Thus, this thesis focuses
on a specific case for understanding the nature of integration, rather than developing
general considerations by presenting different cases and using a comparative
approach. By focusing on a specific case, the study aims to develop an introductory
approach to analyzing and evaluating the archeological heritage in rural settings and
determining the basic concepts involved. In this manner, the historical and physical
formations of different components within the historical context, including
governmental decisions and interventions are investigated within the case study. In
parallel, the values of the given site to be protected together with the problems and
threats to be averted are identified.
Since rural settlements are defined by the interaction between humans and nature, the
rural community play a crucial role in the conservation of archeological heritage in
rural settings6. However, the main concern of this thesis is not to analyze the social
structure of the community involved and its impact on the historical and physical
integration processes as this would require a particular focus distinct from the analysis
of the physical context. Nevertheless, the formation of the socio-cultural environment
is investigated by an analysis of historical processes to a certain extent.
In the end, the main aims of this study are to reveal the values created through the
processes involved in the coexistence of the archeological sites and rural settlements
as well as the problems and threats they are faced with. In this regard, the aim is to

6

Erdem, 2012, p. 13.

propose strategies for the conservation of the values of both the archeological heritage
and rural identities while adopting a holistic approach in the course of a case study.

1.3. Methodology and Structure of the Thesis
With the aim of analyzing the results of the integration and developing a series of
principles and strategies based on the values, threats and potentials resulting from this
integration, this thesis is structured around a case study by identifying a conceptual
framework for developing an approach to understanding the case. Thus, the study
proceeds in two phases including theoretical and conceptual research, and analyzing
and evaluating the specific case. In the first phase, it is aimed to determine a
conceptual framework for the study on rural settlements containing archeological
heritage. In pursuit of this, a theoretical study on the concepts of rurality and
archeological heritage is performed with a focus on understanding the basic
approaches of archeological heritage conservation in rural landscapes. In relation to
this, international charters, Turkish legislation, and different cases that have occurred
in the course of the ever-changing nature of conservation approaches are rethought in
this context.
The theoretical concept of rurality is discussed in the light of the ideas and research of
Michael Bunce, Rural Settlement in an Urban World (1982); Michael Hill, Access to
Geography: Rural Settlement and the Urban Impact on the Countryside (2003) as a
means of defining “what is rural?”. In terms of approaches to rural landscapes and
rural identity, Paul Claval, Reading the Rural Landscapes in Landscape and Urban
Planning (2005) and the doctoral thesis by Meltem Erdem, Kırsal Yerleşim Peyzaj
Kimlik Önerilerinin Tespiti, Korunması ve Geliştirilmesine Yönelik Değerlendirme
Matrisi Önerisi (2012) both remain as important reference works. For the discussions
on archeological heritage, international documents regarding cultural heritage
preservation together with rural landscape are the basic sources used in this study,
specifically: the Charter for the Protection and Management of the Archeological

5

Heritage7, the European Convention on the Protection of the Archeological Heritage8
and the IFLA Principles Concerning Rural Landscapes as Heritage9.
The second phase includes the case study which employs several methods in both the
analysis and evaluation processes. In the case selection, the basic criteria are defined
for a comprehensive analysis of the integration of archeological sites and rural
settlements. For the purpose of understanding the dynamics of the rural landscape, the
integration between the archeological site and the rural settlement is deemed to be the
most important feature in the selection process. This means the rural settlement should
be both physically and socio-economically integrated with the archeological site. Such
an integration creates a “connection” and a “relation” between the two settings. This
connection, or relation, as a second criterion, should not have been seriously
interrupted or compromised by intervening factors because, the physical, social and
cultural characteristics of this coexistence are dependent on the process and continuity
of the relationship. Another feature is the rurality of the settlement; a settlement can
be defined as “rural” in terms of the basic features that have been defined in the first
phase, i.e., the conceptual framework. In addition, it is crucial for it to be an “active
rural settlement”. What is emphasized here is the continuing existence of a relationship
between humans and nature in terms of economic profit and the routines of daily life.
A value assessment of both components constitutes another criterion. Both the
archeological site and the rural settlement should be valuable in terms of their
physical, social, economic characteristics, and/or should have scientific importance.
Lastly, the existence of areas of challenge or the presence of a specific threat is
significant in the assessment process.

Physical: a direct physical interaction between the archeological site and rural
settlement
Socio-economic: an active interaction between the local community and the
archeological site as a part of the cultural identity of the settlement

Connection

An uninterrupted relationship between the rural settlement and the archeological
site

Valuable
Components

Both archeological site and rural settlement should have values such as built

Rurality

Definition: Compatible with the definition of “rural”, in terms of population,
basic economic activities and relation with nature.
Activity: Being an active rural settlement sustainable in terms of its everyday life
and rural identity.

Areas of
Challenge

The existence of threats or challenges as a way of understanding the outcomes of
the coexistence.

Based on the given criteria, the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık was selected (Table 1.2).
The site is located on the Aegean Coast of Turkey within the boundaries of the
Province of Muğla. Iasos is an ancient city which was located on a peninsula
previously separated from the mainland by a narrow channel. The mainland area
formed the extra-urban site of the ancient city of Iasos and is now occupied by the
present-day rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık, with the coastal village occupying the site
of the Roman necropolis. Both the village and archeological site have significant
values. The built environment of village includes a small number of traditional houses
and three olive oil plants as well as archeological remains. With its population, and its
economic dependence on olive groves and fishing, Kıyıkışlacık is a settlement with a
rural identity. Iasos is also considered to offer great opportunities for archeological
research still awaiting investigation on both the promontory and the mainland10. There
is a strong physical integration between the rural settlement and the archeological site,
especially on the mainland. Rather than completely overlapping with the archeological
10

site, this physical integration takes place in an interaction area which is thought to be
advantageous in terms of its various components with their different values.
Moreover, the local residents have strong socio-economic relation with the
archeological site, having hosted the excavation team for many years. The excavations
at Iasos provided an alternative source of income in the form of employment on
excavations, food and accommodation services and the sale of local products. A
considerable degree of raised awareness is another outcome of this socio-economic
integration. The local people have been informed about the importance of Iasos and
its physical setting by the excavation team. The physical and socio-economic relations
have been sustained since the establishment of the village and have been relatively
uninterrupted by interventions. However, the construction of secondary houses and
tourist facilities on the periphery of the village has created a pressure on this
coexistence. The effects of such developments can now be observed in the loss of
agricultural land and threats to the archeological layers. As a result, the village has a
heterogeneous structure consisting of three identities: Iasos, the village of Kıyıkışlacık
and the secondary housing areas. Such a coexistence presents a good example of a
case suitable for analysis and study regarding solutions to the problems of rural
settlements incorporated into archeological sites.
The structure of the case study is based on urban conservation analyses methods and
follows the stages of: pre-survey and survey, analysis and evaluation, and decision
making11 using the rural landscape identity assessment method developed by Erdem12.
Following the main stages of the former method, the primary approach of the latter
method concerning rural settlements is taken as the basis for the evaluation stage. In
this stage, value assessment approaches regarding the cultural heritage conservation
are also used13. In the analysis process, the information related to the case study is
gathered using four different methods:

The literature survey aims to combine the earlier studies on Iasos and Kıyıkışlacık by
employing a comprehensive approach. There are several modern sources in absence
of which this thesis would have been impossible. The historical information and
general description of Iasos with detailed information about archeological remains are
provided by the works of Doro Levi, Iasos Kazıları (1986); Arslantepe, Hieropolis,
Iasos, Kyme: Türkiye’deki İtalyan Kazıları (1993) edited by Fede Berti, Daria de
Bernardi Ferrero, Marcella Frangipane and Sebastiana Lagona, and Ufuk Serin, Early
Christian and Byzantine Churches at Iasos in Caria: An Architectural Survey (2004).
In terms of approaches to archeological survey on the mainland, Raffaella Pierobon
Benoit, Mandalya Körfezi: Yüzey Araştırması Sonuçları ve Yeni Perspektifler (2005)
and Iasos e La Caria (2005) comprise important sources, tracing the rural
characteristics and historical development of the mainland. Likewise, the information
regarding the chamber tombs and necropolis is covered by Paolo Emilio Pecorella, La
Cultura Preistorica di Iasos in Caria (1984), and Francesco Tomasello, L’acquedotto
Romano e la Necropoli Presso l’istmo (1991). Together with the excavation reports,
these sources cast light on the historical process of formation as well as the scientific
studies carried out on the site. In addition, the article by Ufuk Serin, Threats and
Vulnerabilities in Archeological Sites. Case Study: Iasos (2005) provides the main
framework for this thesis by defining the basic problems and threats that exist
regarding the integration of the archeological site of Iasos and the village of
Kıyıkışlacık.
As a second method, information is gathered from different institutions namely: The
Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (T.C. Çevre ve Şehircilik Bakanlığı), The
Municipality of Milas (Milas Belediyesi), the Muğla Regional Conservation Council
of Cultural Proporties (Muğla Kültür Varlıklarını Koruma Bölge Kurulu) 14 and the
General Directorate of Mapping (Harita Genel Müdürlüğü - HGM). The 1/1000 scale

1954, 1972, 1975, 1992, 1998 and 201215, ownership information, partial and regional
plans, site and building designations and conservation council decisions16 comprise
the basic data gathered from these institutions. Some of these data are processed in
different sections of the analyses. Such as, the base map is used in the data collection
on site, whereas the aerial photographs are consulted in the course of the historical
research. The data regarding the present physical environment has been gathered on
site through three different field surveys as the third method. In these site surveys,
information about open and built up areas have been collected on the base map and
systematically photographed (Figure 1.1). Additionally, survey sheets have been
prepared and filled on site regarding archeological remains (Figure 1.2).

The presentation of the collected information, both the on-site records and from the
institutions is based on data processing using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
The information collected on maps at site surveys was added to a data model which
was prepared accordingly. The maps that are presented in the following chapters were
exported from this database on ArcGIS on a reproduction of the 1/1000 scale base
map supplied by the Municipality of Milas. Additionally, NetCAD, AutoCAD, Adobe
Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator were used in data processing and presentation as
secondary computer programs.

As a final method, in-depth interviews with the local people about the historical
development of the settlement were carried out on site. In fact, due to the lack of
scientific studies and sources concerning the history of the village of Kıyıkışlacık,
these interviews are considered to be the primary sources for the analysis of the
formation process of the village17.
Within the two phases of research, this thesis is structured in five chapters. The first
phase includes Chapter 2 as the theoretical framework. The second phase concerning
the case study is presented with Chapters 3, 4 and 5 as analysis, evaluation and
strategy proposals regarding the Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık case (Table 1.3).
Chapter 1, as an introductory chapter, presents the general approach of the thesis with
a brief introduction to the topic, problem statement, aim and scope of the study,
methodology and structure of the thesis. The general systematic approach of the thesis
can be followed in this chapter.
Chapter 2 includes a theoretical discussion on rurality and archeological heritage
conservation. First, a theoretical framework and definitions of rurality are discussed.
This is followed by the historical development of archeological heritage conservation,
with a particular emphasis on the rural landscapes, which are all analyzed through the
medium of international conservation approaches. In this context, the Turkish
experience is analyzed through the legal regulations on the conservation of
archeological heritage and rural settlements. Concerning the Turkish experience, a
classification of different types of integration or separation between archeological
sites and rural settlements is presented.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES AND RURAL SETTLEMENTS: DEFINITIONS,
CONCEPTS AND REGULATIONS

Rural landscapes are integral parts of the natural environment worldwide. They stand
as on-going interaction areas between humans and nature. The use of natural
resources, such as agriculture, fishing, forestry, animal husbandry, food gathering and
hunting, comprises the main component of this interaction, something distinguishing
rural landscapes from urban settings18.

Rural landscapes with their natural

components and products support the sustainability of human life on earth. The
character of the production patterns and built environment in rural landscapes reflect
the cultural identity of a rural community with its traditions as indicators of its social
and economic characteristics.
Archeological heritage, on the other hand, forms significant component of rural
landscapes in Turkey due to the long history of human habitation in Anatolia. As a
result, the contribution of this heritage to the cultural identity of rural landscapes is
also an outcome of the long interaction processes between humans and nature.
However, rural landscapes have been subject to rapid changes since the beginning of
the urbanization process.
The population migrations from rural to urban settlements has been one of the main
impacts of modernization leading to the erosion of rural identities. Parallel threats have
occurred in present day rural landscapes caused by a reverse migration from urban to
rural settlements. In fact, the negative impacts of the post-modernization process, such
as urban development, environmental pollution and an increasing demand for

18

ICOMOS, 2017.

17

recreational areas, has produced a “counter urbanization”19. Thus threatening rural
landscapes by the byproducts of changes in social structure. The impacts of these
changes have largely affected the built environment as well as the elements of cultural
heritage located in rural landscapes. This has resulted in the conservation of cultural
heritage including archeological heritage in rural landscapes became the focus of the
conservation discipline and rural studies within the last decade.
In this chapter, the main concepts regarding rural landscapes and archeological
heritage conservation are presented in the context of conservation practices on
international and national levels.

2.1. The Concept of Rurality
Theoretical and methodological studies on rurality have concentrated on three main
concepts: rural settlement, rural landscape, and rural identity. In the process of
defining and intervening in rural areas, the scope of the studies has become enlarged
with the inclusion of both natural and social components of the so-called rural
landscapes. In this section, the different approaches to these three concepts will be
presented as follows.

Rural Settlements
The built environments in rural landscapes are the core elements of rural studies, since
they are considered as being the major component of rurality. Rural settlements are
defined in different ways according to differing parameters. The differences of
parameters for defining the rural settlements are mainly based on the rural
development policies of the nations concerned20. These definitions are generally
centered around urban-rural differentiation, population/diversity and agricultural
19

18

activities. The urban-rural distinction is a tendency to define rural areas as “non-urban
settlements” or settlements outside the urban tissue. The Turkish State Planning
Organization (Devlet Planlama Teşkilatı) has included the distinctions between the
urban-rural and the village-city concepts in the definition of rural settlements21.
Likewise, a study on the urban and rural division also defines rural settlements by
noting the differences from urban areas in several dimensions as follows22.

Table 2.1. Comparison between urban and rural settlements (Scott, Gilbert, Gelan
and Carter, 2014, Table 1)

Another common parameter in defining the rural settlements is population size. A
specific population criterion is identified for settlements to be defined as rural. These
criteria are vary considerably when the approaches of different countries are

settlements by different countries.

Besides specifying the population, some definitions are based on the population
density and size of the settlement. Rural settlements are considered to be low in
population density within a dispersed tissue23. The European Commission define the
settlements as predominantly urban, intermediate or predominantly rural according to
the percentage of population living in the local residential units. The share of
population living in the local units of the settlement should be higher than %50 to be

23

Erdem, 2012, p. 13.

20

defined as rural24. The same approach is adopted by the OECD, which defines a
settlement as rural, if the population density is lower than 150 inhabitant per km25.
The population parameters are also used in the Turkish legislation. The Village Act
(Köy Kanunu) defines rural settlements as settlement areas with a population under
2000 people26. However, settlements with a population over 2000 may also have a
rural character. In fact, defining the rural settlements only according to the criterion
of population may lead to critical exclusions. The concept of rurality represents a
direct human-nature relationship in a specific geography. Thus, inputs like the sociocultural and economic life style should be included in the definitions, as well as the
specific character of the built environment. The Village Act has some considerations
on these issues in identifying the built environment. The act states that villages have
common properties like a mosque, school, and pasture, with people living in compact
or sprawling arrangements of houses with their fields, orchards and vineyards27.
However, there is an absence of social components, as well as a comprehensive
physical definition.
The socio-cultural and economic components of rurality rarely feature in these rural
settlement definitions. Nick Gallent defines rurality in terms of three types of concept:
functional concepts, political and economic concepts, and social constructions of
rurality28. By emphasizing the socio-spatial diversities, a rural settlement is defined as
as “Interconnections between socio-cultural constructs of rurality and nature…, and
the actual lived experiences and practices of lives in these spaces”. From a similar
perspective, the face-to-face relations, a strong solidarity in daily activities, the
experiences and traditions forming daily life are identified by Mahmut Tezcan as
forming the social structure of rural settlements29.

Another detailed definition is proposed by Ruşen Keleş in the Dictionary of Urban
Sciences (Kentbilim Terimleri Sözlüğü). Keleş also emphasizes the face-to-face
relations between the local people and states that a rural settlement is a settlement with
agriculture and animal husbandry as the main economic activities30. Although
agricultural activities and animal husbandry are the major sources of income in rural
settlements, other economic activities such as tourism and mining are also significant
economic sectors in some rural settlements. In fact, rural settlements have a
multifunctional economic character where the different factors support each other in
the current globalized world order31. A similar approach with a focus on major
economic activities can be observed in Michael Bunce’s description. He states that the
economic sources of income in rural settlements are mainly generated from the
primary resources, such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishing32.
The definitions of rural settlements vary according to the different parameters used,
as mentioned before. However, those based on the definitions of urban settlements
and using specific parameters tend to exclude factors such as population, density and
economic activity. The most significant feature of rural settlements is the relationship
between humans and nature. This relationship is mutual in terms of physical
interaction. The form of the settlement and the economic activities are provided by
nature, and the communities shape the natural environment while developing the
land33. This means that the communities live in harmony with nature on the rural
settlements. By reason of their natural character, rural settlements are defined as the
components of “natural circulation” while the urban areas are “artificial additions”34.
As mentioned earlier, the inclusion of social components is crucial in defining rural
settlements. A community living close to the nature, with strong relations between its
members and a sense of belonging to the settlement, is an integral part of the concept

of rurality. The physical formation of the settlement is highly affected by traditions,
daily-life activities and the social structure of this specific community. Taking into
account these considerations, rural settlements have gradually been defined in their
socio-cultural and physical environment, as integral parts of the “rural landscape”.

Rural Landscape and Identity
The concept of landscape has long been debated. There are several definitions and all
of them focus on the relationship between humans and the land. The definition
provided by the Council of Europe on the European Landscape Convention is
considered to take a comprehensive approach by stating “Landscape means an area,
as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of
natural and/or human factors”35.
Research on the rural landscapes has mainly focused on its historic components.
However, the rural landscapes, in general, are as integral part of the combination of
the natural environment, the social existence of a local community and the physical
environment shaped by the community’s traditional lifestyle and production patterns.
Here, the cultural dimension of the rural landscapes is provided by the existence of a
community in a specific geography. The local values produced by the ethnicity, social
structure, traditions and rituals have impacts on both the natural and man-made
environment, especially in rural areas36.
Rural identities on the other hand, are directly created by the unique formations of the
rural landscapes. The indigenous coexistence of the natural environment, a specific
community and the built-up environment created through the historical process, which
is defined as the rural landscape, creates the rural identity.

Figure 2.1. Different dimensions of the landscape (Tudor, 2014, Figure 2)

The term identity in general refers to the distinctive features of a settlement which
distinguish it from other settlements37. Thus, rural settlements should be defined on
the basis of their identities in order to reflect their indigenous features. However,
conventional definitions generally focus on the population and the physical structure
of the settlements, as mentioned earlier. The typologies are developed according to
these definitions rather than a consideration of the specific identities. The typological
studies also concentrate on the physical components of settlements with the general
tendency regarding the categorization of rural settlements since the 19th century has
been primarily concerned with the physical setting of the man-made environment38.
The physical setting of a rural settlement includes its geographical location, the
number and density of the buildings and the layout of the settlement39. However, the

37

Lynch, 1990, p. 8.
Kohl, as the earliest researcher of the rural settlements, identifies different settlements according to
their location. See Bunce, 1982.

38

24

social contribution of the local community has been generally neglected in the
characterization of rural settlements.
On the other hand, the characterization of a rural settlement in terms of its identity
reflects various local values. A rural settlement is identified by its ethnicity, historical
establishment, economic activities or geographical location, in accordance with their
dominance. For instance, two different villages located on mountains can be identified
differently due to their socio-cultural features: a village located on Çomakdağ is
identified as a Yörük village due to the dominant ethnicity of its inhabitants, while
another one in the Blacksea Region is called a Yayla (Highland) village, reflecting its
cultural characteristics in accordance to the functional characteristics of the village.
Although these two villages are both located on mountains, the dominance of different
features leads to them being given different identifications. As a result, definitions
should be based on the rural identities emerging from the indigenous rural landscape,
instead of the limited typologies based on physical characteristics.
The existence of a remarkable natural and cultural heritage in the landscape of rural
settlements has a significant impact on the formation of their identity. In reality, the
components of the historical layers of cultural heritage are prominent in the formation
of the unique character of the rural settlements. In this regard, the existence of
archeological heritage, as defined in the scope of this study, becomes a fundamental
component of the identity of a rural settlement within its surrounding landscape.

2.2. Archeological Heritage
Sites of archeological remains are the fundamental parts of the historical and physical
integrity of the current built environment. As mentioned earlier, both urban and rural
areas contain significant remains of former civilizations due to the continuous
inhabitation of the geographically advantageous sites. Thus, archeological sites are

25

integral components of urban and rural identities40. This has meant that the
conservation of archeological heritage has always been at the core of settlement
studies. Yet, earlier attitudes towards archeological heritage were not as
comprehensive as in its currently developing scope.
The interest in searching for and exploring past civilizations dates back to the
Renaissance in Europe41. Earlier approaches to archeological remains mainly
concentrated on collecting the assets for individual collections. Archeology, as a
science, developed from this predilection for researching ancient resources and
remains and collecting the assets42. Not only did the remains aboveground attract the
interest of archeologists but they also started to excavate those underground. Rather
than simply collecting the remains, the quest for enlightenment about historical
information concerning ancient civilizations became a specific objective of these
excavations. Archeology became increasingly important as a provider of information
which was not available from written sources. So, museology evolved from simply
involving collecting the assets from ancient civilizations into an important resource
for delving into human history.
Starting from the 18th century, the general approach towards archeological assets was
presenting movable assets such as tools, sculptures and architectural pieces in
museums. Especially in Europe, the archeological heritage started to be conceived of
as valuable pieces of common cultural history and it acquired increasing symbolic
values43. In time, the emphasis shifted from single assets to the settlements they
emanated from and an interest developed in uncovering the structural characteristics
of these settlements.
At the beginning of the 19th century, interventions started to be made in ancient
heritage sites in the form of the restoration, consolidation and repair of buildings that

were thought to have representational value44. In the 20th century, the main concern
became the presentation of archeological heritage and the dissemination of the
knowledge embedded in it. This led to the remains starting to be observed on site (insitu) rather than in museums (ex-situ)45. As a result, the importance of excavations
with site representation concerns became the focus of scientific studies.
Until 20th century, approaches towards archeological heritage concentrated on the
presentation of single assets without any comprehensive conservation concern. It was
in 20th century that the conservation of both in-situ and ex-situ remains became the
focus of interventions on archeological sites. Together with the increasing recognition
in the international scientific arena, archeology and archeological heritage became one
of the most the significant concerns of the conservation of cultural heritage. With the
contribution of the formulation of international declarations regarding good practice
and the scientific studies that have been carried out since the second half of 20th
century, archeology is now accepted as an ever-evolving, inter-disciplinary
methodology for research into the history of humanity.

2.3. Development of the Conservation Approaches to the Archeological Heritage
in Rural Landscapes
Within the scope of this thesis, current conservation approaches towards the
archeological heritage existing in rural landscapes are investigated together with the
progressive development of these approaches. As such, one particular, integrated
approach is usually absent from conservation perspectives, and attitudes towards
archeological heritage and rural landscapes have evolved separately46. The related

45

27

developments are presented as follows, starting with the international approaches and
the specific Turkish experience.

International Approaches to the Conservation of Archeological Heritage
and Rural Landscapes
The development of international approaches towards the conservation of cultural
heritage has been a comprehensive and integrative process. Both the term cultural
heritage and the conservation principles are considered to be continually evolving and
broadening concepts47. In this development process, archeological heritage and rural
landscape are mentioned in several documents. In this section, the results of the search
of “archeological heritage/site” and “rural landscapes/settlements” within the
international conservation approaches are presented (Figure 2.2).
The First International Congress of Classical Archeology, which took place in 1905,
is considered to be one of the earliest attempts towards the conservation of cultural
heritage48. A large gathering of scholars, people representing universities, museums
and governmental institutions met in the Parthenon at Athens. Archeology of different
periods, excavations, museums, conservation of archeological assets and educational
issues were the main topics of this congress, as a result of concepts developed in the
course of 19th century practices49.
The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments, as the first
international document on the conservation of cultural heritage, was the outcome of
another congress held in Athens in 1931. Although the main concern of the Athens
Charter was the preservation of monumental buildings, there was a concern expressed
for archeological heritage as well. The fourth resolution on the charter notes that,
“Excavated sites which are not subject to immediate restoration should be reburied for

28

protection”. In addition, the general conservation approaches concerning education,
rights of the public and their cooperation were also identified in this document.
The understanding of archeological sites as cultural heritage can also be observed in
the protocol document of The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural
Property in the Event of Armed Conflict in 1954. In fact, the protection of registered
cultural properties was suggested to be effected by placing a specific emblem on them
in times of war or armed conflicts.
Although archeological heritage conservation is considered to be a long standing
practice, the identification of international principles specific to archeological
practices only took place in the 1950s50. The Recommendation on International
Principles Applicable to Archeological Excavations was revealed by UNESCO in
1956. The most significant approach in this document was to prioritize the
conservation of archeological assets and sites, as well as identifying management
issues, such as the accessibility of the excavation sites, education of the community
and the organization of administrative services. Another important concern of the
recommendation was the evaluation of archeological assets within their environmental
context. Article 31 of the Recommendation on International Principles Applicable to
Archeological Excavations was dedicated to the return of movable elements to their
countries of origin by noting:
“Excavation services and museums should lend one another assistance
in order to ensure or facilitate the recovery of objects derived from
clandestine excavations or theft, and of all objects exported in
infringement of the legislation of the country of origin. It is desirable
that each Member State should take the necessary measures to ensure
this recovery”.

In the 1960s, landscapes started to be defined and discussed in international
conservation forums. The Recommendation Concerning the Safeguarding of the
Beauty and Character of Landscapes was issued by UNESCO in 1962, with
consideration regarding natural landscapes within specific historical periods.
Accordingly, the cultural importance of natural and man-made landscapes and sites
was discussed in relation to their aesthetic values. This document is significantly
substantial in terms of defining the major imperatives for the preservation and even
the restoration of rural, natural and urban landscapes as noted in Article 1 as, “For the
purpose of the present recommendation, the safeguarding of the beauty and character
of landscapes and sites is taken to mean the preservation and, where possible, the
restoration of the aspect of natural, rural and urban landscapes and sites, whether
natural or man-made, which have a cultural or aesthetic interest or form typical natural
surroundings.”, as well as the threat factors noted in Article 7. Landscape approaches
to rural planning was also mentioned in this document as a protective measure by
Articles 14 and 15 as:
“Urban and rural planning schemes should embody provisions defining
the obligations which should be imposed to ensure the safeguarding of
landscapes and sites, even unscheduled ones, situated on the territory
affected.” (Article 14)
“Urban and rural planning schemes should be drawn up in order of
urgency, specifically for towns or regions in process of rapid
development, where the protection of the aesthetic or picturesque
character of the town or region justifies the establishment of such
schemes.” (Article 15)
The International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and
Sites, also known as the Charter of Venice, was revealed by UNESCO, in 1964, and
is considered fundamental, within the scope of the present study, as one of the
landmarks for the development of international approaches towards the conservation
of cultural heritage. Although the general emphasis rested on historical monuments,
the scope of cultural heritage definition was enlarged to include the surrounding

31

environment of any historic monument, as a progressive approach in the 1960s. Article
1 of the Charter of Venice defines the concepts of historic monuments as follows:
“The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single
architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found
the evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a
historic event. This applies not only to great works of art but also to
more modest works of the past which have acquired cultural
significance with the passing of time.”
Conserving cultural heritage on-site was another approach advocated in the Charter of
Venice regarding the physical setting of assets by noting it in Article 7 as, ”A
monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the
setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed
except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by
national or international interest of paramount importance”. By including “rural
settings” in these definitions, the Charter of Venice is considered a significant
document in the process of developing the conservation of archeological heritage in
rural landscapes.
The European Convention on the Protection of the Archeological Heritage was issued
by Council of Europe in 1969, as another document on archeological heritage51. The
natural and physical setting of archeological heritage was also taken into consideration
in Article 1, by noting, “The preservation and study of which help to retrace the history
of mankind and its relation with the natural environment”. In addition, an integrated
concept of conservation was aimed at in development plans by means of including
financial and administrative approaches, as Article 5 describes.
In 1972, the World Heritage Convention was announced by UNESCO. This is
accepted as an essential document by virtue of its integration of natural heritage into
the field of cultural heritage conservation52. Both natural and cultural values are
defined as a “shared heritage of humankind” i.e. world heritage. The significance of
51
52

The Convention was revised and republished in 1992.
Feilden and Jokilehto, 1998, p. 9.

32

the declaration lies in its comprehensive approach towards the definition of the term
heritage by including the built and natural environments together with their
ethnographical and anthropological components53.
From the 1970s and 1980s onwards, rural settlements were at the core of international
conservation approaches. Several recommendations and documents on rural heritage
were issued. Although these concentrated on historical rural settlements, this process
is significant in terms of fostering the development of rural studies. Stressing “the
continuity of rural communities”, “characteristic villages” and “cultural heritage in
countryside”, the Amsterdam Declaration issued by ICOMOS in 1975, integrated the
concept of rurality into the wider conservation field. The Granada Appeal: Rural
Architecture in Regional Planning was declared in the Symposium No: 2 of the
European Programme of Pilot Projects in 1977, and recognizes the existence of
threatening developments to rural heritage sites with an emphasis on the dangers of
modernization54. Furthermore, the correlation between rural architectural heritage and
socio-economic and natural contexts was revealed. In the following years,
recommendations made by the Council of Europe also concentrated on rural heritage.
The revitalization of declining rural settlements, socio-economic approaches towards
the conservation of rural heritage and the identification of threats created by socioeconomic components were the major topics discussed in these recommendations.
While the rural architectural heritage was the center of concern of conservation studies
at the international level, archeological heritage also stayed in the focus in the 1980s.
In the concluding report of an international colloquium on Archeology and Planning,
organized jointly by the Council of Europe and the Region of Tuscany in 1984, urban
and rural developments were a prominent subject together with their effects on
archeological heritage sites. In order to overcome the problems of conservation, the
need for the integration of the values of archeological heritage into planning processes
was emphasized in this document. A similar approach was adopted in The
53
54

See Article 1.
See Articles 3, 6 and 8.

33

Recommendation on the Protection and Enhancement, which was issued in 1989 by
the Council of Europe. As its name highlights, the importance of planning practices
for the conservation of archeological heritage sites was specified, and the necessity of
completing ongoing inventories and identifying legislative, financial and technical
measures was stressed55.
In the 1990s archeological heritage management became a prominent issue due to a
realization of the pressure exerted by spatial developments and illegal interventions.
This resulted in the publishing of The Charter for the Protection and Management of
the Archeological Heritage by ICOMOS in 1990. In order to prevent the damage
caused by spatial development, the need for archeological heritage conservation to be
included in planning activities was emphasized, in similarity to the former approaches,
such as the international colloquium on Archeology and Planning. Principles
regarding the administrative, legislative, financial and technical issues mainly
concerning

reconstruction, restoration, maintenance and

excavations

were

recommended to be adopted by planning policies on a national level. Voicing a
specific concern for the surrounding environment of archeological heritage and the
need for maintenance and protection, Article 6 of this charter notes:
“The overall objective of archaeological heritage management should
be the preservation of monuments and sites in situ, including proper
long-term conservation and curation of all related records and
collections etc. Any transfer of elements of the heritage to new locations
represents a violation of the principle of preserving the heritage in its
original context. This principle stresses the need for proper
maintenance, conservation and management. It also asserts the principle
that the archaeological heritage should not be exposed by excavation or
left exposed after excavation if provision for its proper maintenance and
management after excavation cannot be guaranteed.”
With the development of new concepts and approaches, a need for a revision of the
European Convention on the Protection of the Archeological Heritage became
apparent. The document, first drafted in 1969, was revised and re-issued in 1992. The
55

Yıldırım Esen, 2014, p. 33.

34

integration of conservation policies into planning practices with the creation of
interdisciplinary forum between archeologists and urban planners was the main focus
of the revised version of this convention56. Financial, educational and administrative
issues were also the subjects of the focus of the convention.
Rural settlements were also subjects of interest in the 1990s. The Cork Declaration
regarding rural development was released in 1996 by the European Commission. The
uniqueness of rural areas was emphasized under the heading of “Aware” as: “that rural
areas- which are the home of a quarter of the population and account for more than
80% of the territory of the European Union – are characterized by a unique cultural,
economic and social fabric, an extraordinary patchwork of activities, and a great
variety of landscapes (forest and farmland, unspoiled natural sites, villages and small
towns, regions centers, small industries)”. This document is significant in terms of
assigning value to rural areas and suggesting the conservation of these values by
means of sustainable rural development.
In the 21st century, the concept and vision of cultural heritage has been broadened.
The interpretation of cultural heritage, cultural routes, industrial heritage sites,
intangible heritage, and heritage as a stimulus for economic development are some of
the new concepts developed from the beginning of the 21st century in particular. In the
context of this thesis, documents concerning rural landscapes are considered to be the
most significant developments of the 21st century. Starting from the European
Landscape Convention held in 2000 by the Council of Europe, rural landscapes have
been the subject of studies on the conservation of cultural heritage. For instance,
Article 2 of the European Landscape Convention includes the definitions and
planning, management and conservation principles of “landscapes” covering natural,
urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Although a specific emphasis was not placed on
rural landscapes, this document has significance regarding the integration of

56

An international cooperation was established as a result of this approach, which was thought to
provide a suitable background for exchanging knowledge and experience on archeological heritage
conservation.

35

landscapes into planning and conservation policies. Some of the specific articles of
this convention on awareness-raising, education, identification, implementation and
monitoring aimed at securing the conservation and continuity of landscapes.
As the most comprehensive and most recent international document in terms of the
scope of this study, the IFLA Principles Concerning Rural Landscapes as Heritage
were adopted by the 19th ICOMOS General Assembly in 2017. In general, this
document provides guidelines for the sustainable transformation of rural landscapes,
with specific concerns for the issues of ethics, culture and environment using a a multiscale approach. An all-embracing definition of the rural landscape is formulated by
noting that “all rural areas are landscapes”. Accordingly, rural landscapes are
considered the product of interactions between humans and nature. Such interactions
are defined by means of the production of food and use of other natural resources.
Cultural significance provided by local communities was also emphasized in the
definition noted in Chapter 1, Section A as:
“For the purpose of this document, rural landscapes are terrestrial and
aquatic areas co-produced by human-nature interaction used for the
production of food and other renewable natural resources, via
agriculture, animal husbandry and pastoralism, fishing and
aquaculture, forestry, wild food gathering, hunting, and extraction of
other resources, such as salt. Rural landscapes are multifunctional
resources. At the same time, all rural areas have cultural meanings
attributed to them by people and communities: all rural areas are
landscapes.”
In addition, rural landscapes are accepted as heritage sites reflecting the tangible and
intangible heritage of rural areas. Rural identities are also included in the definitions
as rural landscapes providing a sense of identity representing economic, physical,
socio-cultural and natural components. Conservation of the natural and cultural
components of the rural landscapes is considered crucial for the future sustainability
of human existence. Accordingly, threats, such as the changing demographic, cultural,
structural and environmental values of rural landscapes are identified. Due to the
inexorable processes of transformation in rural landscapes, conservation policies need

36

to be formulated with a view to the management of change. Identification,
documentation, the creation of inventories and catalogues, the integration of local
communities as a basic source of knowledge, as well as of public institutions, NGO’s
and universities are all considered as components of understanding the heritage
context of rural landscapes. For the integrated conservation of rural landscapes,
several principles are described for the protection, sustainable management and
transmission of the identified heritage.
As additional sources for the development at an international level of the conservation
of rural areas, The Village Design Guides and The EU Rural Development Policy
2014-2020 should be noted. Different examples of The Village Design Guides identify
design parameters according to the needs of the local communities57. With their
consideration of the conservation and sustainability of rural identities within their
physical and socio-cultural components, these guidelines are intended as an
interdisciplinary approach to courses of implementation. The EU Rural Development
Policy is another document which was issued by European Commission in 2014. It
describes rural planning policies with objectives for the economic, social and
environmental development of rural areas.

The Conservation of Archeological Heritage and Rural Landscapes in the
Turkish Legislative Context
In the context of the global developments, the Turkish experience is analyzed under
two separate headings in this section: legislation on conservation of archeological
heritage, and rural landscapes.

The Conservation of Archeological Heritage in the Turkish Legislative
Context
As mentioned earlier, Turkey is very rich in archeological heritage from prehistoric
times through to the end of the medieval, Byzantine and Seljuk periods. Thus,
archeological studies have a special significance in Turkey, and during the
modernization period, the earlier practices of archeology have been carried out since
the beginning of the 19th century58. The initial investigations were conducted by
foreign archeologists during the Ottoman period, in a search for the traces of ancient
Greek culture and the subsequent civilizations in Anatolia59. As the interest in
antiquities increased with these studies, the establishment of the Ottoman Imperial
Museum took place in 1869. However, the participation of foreign archeologists led
to antiquities being removed from their original locations and exported to Western
Europe. In addition, modern settlements had grown up in the areas within and around
the remains of ancient cities and had used the foundations of the ruined structures as
well as archeological objects as spolia60. The first legal regulation on the conservation
of cultural heritage, Asar-ı Atika Nizamnamesi61, was promulgated in 1869 by Osman
Hamdi Bey and included the protection of antiquities62. With this regulation, the
export of antiquities was partially restricted. The concept of the conservation of
archeological heritage gradually evolved until the end of Ottoman period, by the
following series of revisions of this legal regulation in 1874, 1884 and 1906. The
regulations on excavations, classification of archeological objects and the strict
prohibition of the export of archeological objects were the main concerns of these
regulations. As opposed to the developments in western societies, the main focus of

missions in the 1840s, see Eres, 2016, p. 164.

There were earlier regulations on cultural assets with no specific conservation approach. Since the
focus of this study is archeological sites, the development of conservation legislation is presented within
this scope. For detailed information about the regulations on the conservation of cultural heritage see

archeological studies was related to museums rather than ideologies about
nationalism63.
The real importance of archeology and archeological heritage conservation as a
discipline were not recognized until the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923.
Archeology and the excavation of ancient settlements received an impetus from the
endeavors of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, with a view to revealing a bolstering the identity
of the new Republic64. The Turkish Historical Society (Türk Tarih Kurumu) was
established in 1935 and the first excavations carried out by Turkish teams were
conducted in Alacahöyük and Ahlatlıbel under the auspices of this society. Similarly,
educational approaches to archeology as a discipline were also developed as well as
new concepts such as open-air museums65. The Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in
Ankara was another establishment reflecting the ideological approaches of the Turkish
Republic by exhibiting the remains of Hittite civilizations from its inception.
The establishment of the High Council of Historical Assets and Monuments
(Gayrimenkul Eski Eserler ve AnıtlarYüksek Kurulu - GEEAYK) in 1951 as the first
institution promoting the conservation of cultural heritage is considered the most
significant initiative in the field of conservation in Turkey. The registration of
historical assets and sites, and identification of conservation principles were assigned
to the responsibility of this council by Law No: 1710 in 197366. This law is considered
to constitute a milestone in conservation legislation in Turkey, by bringing into its
core concerns the definition of “site” and “conservation area” for the first time67.
However, the conservation approaches of GEEAYK, together with the legislative

63

Serin, 2008, p. 218.
Archeological studies in the early years of Republican Period concentrated on the Neolithic and
Bronze Age periods in order to support the idea of Turks being earliest civilizations in the Anatolian
region, as noted in the Turkish History Thesis (Türk Tarih Tezi). For further information, see İnan,
1939; Özdoğan, 2012.
65
The first departments of history and archeology were established in Ankara University and Istanbul
University during that period: see Özdoğan, 2006; Serin, 2008, p. 219.

Until the declaration of this Law, the legal regulations issued in 1906 were adopted and used by the

restrictions have been mainly focused on monumental and historical buildings as
single objects since 1973. In this process, the surrounding environment and the
physical setting of the cultural property was neglected, and reversible and irreversible
interventions were carried out. The irreversible effects of conservation interventions
were experienced especially in the rural areas containing archeological heritage. The
historical layering in rural areas was perceived as damaging the cultural properties,
and rural settlements were removed from the area hosting remains of the ancient
settlements.
The enactment of Law No: 1710 signaled a new approach towards the conservation of
cultural heritage by including consideration of the surrounding environments of
monuments and historical buildings, as well as archeological heritage. Communities
are also included in the definition of “site” in the Article 1 of this Law. This article
also defines “archeological sites” as areas containing buried, underwater or unearthed
remains of an ancient settlement or former civilizations. However, the concern for
historical values on an environmental scale was to be developed by the enactment of
Law No: 2863 in 1983. New concepts such as “cultural heritage” and “conservation”
were included in this Law. The scope of site definition was also extended by including
social and economic features68. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism (T.C.
Kültür ve Turizm Bakanlığı) was empowered with the responsibility for the
conservation of archeological sites as well as other types of cultural heritage. In
addition, a definition of the “conservation plan” was published for the first time.
With several additions and changes, Law No: 2863 is still in force as the basic
legislation on the conservation of cultural heritage in Turkey. Currently, this Law
includes the definitions, regulations on interventions and the institutional organization
necessary for the decision making and implementation processes. Article 6 of Law
No: 2863 defines archeological heritage as a “cultural property” and cultural property
is, in turn, defined as “movable and immovable property on the ground, underground

40

or underwater, regarding science, culture, religion and fine arts of prehistoric and
historic eras or that is of unique scientific and cultural value for social life before and
after recorded history”.
As mentioned earlier, the definitions of “site” and “archeological site” were decided
by Law No: 2863 in 1983. In relation to this Law, Enactment No: 658 was established
in 1999 by the High Council of the Conservation of Cultural and Natural Heritage
(Kültür ve Tabiat Varlıklarını Koruma Yüksek Kurulu), which defines archeological
sites in terms of a grading system, with the exception of Urban Archeological Sites.
Accordingly, 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree, and urban archeological sites, together with
conservation and use regulations for each site are defined in this Enactment. Current
regulations and definitions regarding this enactment are presented below69. Currently,
17081 archeological sites are designated in Turkey (Table 2.4) 70. 14 of them are
declared as World Heritage site by UNESCO (Table 2.5)71.

Legislations and Implementations Regarding Rural Landscapes
The earliest legal regulations on rural settlements were defined by the Village Act No:
442 (442 Sayılı Köy Kanunu) in 1924. In general, this law includes the definitions of
villages, borders of the settlement, identification of the agricultural lands, and
regulations on organizing the social and administrative aspects of daily life. As
mentioned earlier, the definition of a rural settlement is based on the population
criterion in Article 1 as settlement areas with a population under 2000 people.
Although this definition is not extensively detailed in terms of the social and physical
aspects of rural settlements, Article 2 includes some limited considerations on the built
environment by stating that villages have common properties like a mosque, school,
and pasture with people living in compact or sprawling housing with their fields,
orchards and vineyards. With the emphasis on “common properties” and articles on
the building regulations for houses, construction of public buildings and infrastructure,

44

and obligatory collective works, this act considers the local community as one of the
main components of rural settlements72. In fact, a representative (muhtar) and a
council composed of the elected elders of the village, are defined and authorized as
the local bodies responsible for village affairs. With several changes, the Village Act
is still the main legal regulation for defining the rural settlements in Turkey.
Together with the Village Act, the establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture (Ziraat
Vekaleti) in 1924, was one of the significant development of the new Turkish Republic
with specific approaches to rural development. The name of this governmental
institution was changed several times by including and excluding the concepts “village
affairs”, “food”, “livestock” and “forestry”73.
Starting from 1963, Five Year Development Plans were implemented by State
Planning Organization (Devlet Planlama Teşkilatı) with particular approaches to rural
settlements. In fact, the problems regarding rural development were one of the main
concerns of these plans74. In addition, rural development plans were prepared on a
regional scale starting from the 1970s. The main objectives of these plans were the
development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and the provision of basic services
such as drinking water75. The earliest example is the Rural Development Plan of
Çorum Çankırı, which was supported by the World Bank.
As the main legal regulation on settlements and building activities, The Development
Act No: 3194 (3194 Sayılı İmar Kanunu) was enacted in 1985. Together with those
for urban areas, building regulations for rural settlements are defined in this Act, which
72

See Articles 2, 7, 13, 14 and 15.
The name of the ministry was changed in:
- 1974 as the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock
- 1981 as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
- 1983 as the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Village Affairs
- 1991 as the Ministry of Agriculture and Village Affairs
- 2011 as the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock
- 2018 as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

The earliest example is the Rural Development Plan of Çorum Çankırı, which was supported by the
World Bank in 1976. Other examples are Erzurum, Bingöl-Muş, Yozgat, Erzincan-Sivas, and OrduGiresun. For further information, see Erdem, 2012, p. 29.

is still in force, although with several changes. Accordingly, new housing regulations
are defined with specific emphasis on compatibility with the vernacular tissue and
local architectural characteristics of the rural settlements76. Additionally, the granting
of permissions and control of the building activities in the settled area (köy yerleşik
alanı) are assigned to the local administrative body muhtarlık.
The Pasture Act No: 4342 (4342 Sayılı Mera Kanunu) is another legal regulation
affecting rural settlements, which was enacted in 1998. Conservation and control of
the pasture areas by specific regulations aims to improve the quality of the pastures,
and ensure their sustainability. As one of the main economic activities of rural
communities, animal husbandry is supported by this act, with the assignment of
designated pasture lands to village legal entities (köy tüzel kişiliği).
In the 2000s, a growing interest in rural settlements was apparent in the projects and
implementations of the governmental institutions. For instance, The National Rural
Development Strategy (Ulusal Kırsal Kalkınma Planı) in 2006 includes approaches
to the conservation of rural settlements by noting the major objective being to “provide
the development and the sustainability of the working and living conditions of the
rural community with the consideration of the local potentials and resources, and
conservation of natural and cultural properties”77.
Similarly, a project was prepared by the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement
(İmar ve İskan Bakanlığı) in 2008 for defining regulations for the buildings of rural
settlements: Prevalence of Proper Structuring Consistent to the Regional Pattern and
Architectural Character in Rural Settlements (Kırsal Alanlarda Yöresel Doku ve
Mimari Özelliklere Uygun Yapılaşmanın Yaygınlaştırılması). In accordance with this,
projects for the Kayseri and Balıkesir provinces were prepared by the ministry with
the collaboration of the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University in 2008 and 2010. Similar

studies have been carried out in other selected sites: Afyonkarahisar, Erzincan, Hatay,
Kahramanmaraş, Malatya and Trabzon78. Another project on rural settlements was
carried out by the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement with the support of
TÜBİTAK in 2010 and completed in 2015: Rural Planning Focusing on Conservation
(Koruma Odaklı Kırsal Alan Planlaması - KOKAP)79. With the collaboration of the
Karadeniz Technical University and the Selçuk University, a model was proposed. In
preparation for the implementation of the project, studies were started in 2016. The
on-going project of Rural Planning Focusing on Conservation and Identification of
Building Regulations Based on Local Characteristics and Needs in Villages (Kırsal
Alan Planlaması Modeli Uygulaması ve Köylerde Yöresel Özelliklerve İhtiyaçlar
Dahilinde Yapılaşma Koşullarının Belirlenmesi Projesi – KODAKAP), aims support
the preparation of village design guidelines and produce guides and regulations.
Accordingly, seven pilot districts have been selected: Kartepe (Kocaeli), Gürün
(Sivas), Söke (Aydın), Erzin (Hatay), Halfeti (Şanlıurfa), Acıgöl (Nevşehir), and
Çamlıhemşin (Rize)80.
Despite these developments, the Metropolitan Municipality Act No: 6360 (6360 Sayılı
On Dört İlde Büyükşehir Belediyesi ve Yirmi Yedi İlçe Kurulması ile Bazı Kanun ve
Kanun Hükmünde Kararnamelerde Değişiklik Yapılmasına Dair Kanun) was issued
in 2012, and has been affecting the identity and character of rural settlements which
are located within the boundaries of metropolitan provinces. This Act introduces
fourteen new metropolitan municipalities and empowers these municipalities within
the provincial administrative boundaries. This has meant that the status of villages
located in these provinces has been changed to “neighborhood”, which is a component
of urban areas, and their responsibilities were transferred to the municipalities. As a

result, the local values of these villages are threatened by the centralization of local
power and the urbanization of the rural landscapes81.
To sum up, rural settlements in Turkey are regulated by Acts No: 442 and 3194, by
means of definitions, building regulations and administrative issues. In addition, the
Metropolitan Municipality Act No: 6360 affects the status of the rural settlements and
identifies their regulatory conditions. Additionally, the projects of the Ministry of
Environment and Urbanization on rural development planning, provide local
regulations with an approach to conservation embodying the place-specific values of
rural settlements. However, the implementation processes of these rules and
regulations has not been experienced yet. Moreover, the definitions of rural
settlements are restricted by the population criterion with a limited concern for local
socio-cultural characteristics, and several rural settlements have lost their status as
villages due to the recent legislation.

Different Types of Interventions and Approaches towards the
Archeological Heritage in a Rural Setting
With the shift in the paradigm of conservation of cultural heritage from conservation
on single monument scale to environmental protection, rural landscapes including
archeological heritage now exist in different contexts, according to the differences in
the relationship between settlements and heritage sites. Accordingly, a basic
classification of rural landscapes with archeological heritage can be developed. In this
classification, both physical and socio-cultural interaction are taken into consideration
in the scope of this thesis. The physical interaction, location of the rural settlement,
site designations regarding archeological heritage and built environment are evaluated
in this context. In socio-cultural interaction, the interrelationship between the local
community and the archeological site is examined. As a result, three main categories
can be identified: relocated rural settlements, rural settlements overlapping and
81

integrated with an archeological heritage site and rural settlements existing separately
from the archeological context.

Rural Settlements Relocated from Their Original Archeological
Context
As mentioned earlier, conservation approaches in the early 20th century focused on
individual monuments. Before the advent of a more comprehensive consideration of
cultural heritage within its socio-cultural and physical environments in the 1980s, the
rural settlements located on or near an archeological site were removed to nearby
locations82. As a result, this type of rural settlements constitutes a distinct category in
this study of rural landscapes. As the earliest examples, Aphrodisias-Geyre,
Stratonikeia-Eskihisar, and The Thousand and One Churches-Karadağ Region are
selected and explained below to illustrate this type of coexistence. In the case
selection, the existence of the former studies on these settlements were sought, so as
to observe the consequences of implementations.

Aphrodisias - Geyre
The archeological site of Aphrodisias and the village of Geyre are located in
southwestern Turkey within the boundaries of the Province of Aydın.
Starting from the Neolithic period, the ancient city of Aphrodisias was inhabited
continuously by successive civilizations. The city was one of the important settlements
of Caria and became a bishopric center in the 4th century CE83. Its cultural and
archeological significance depends on the unique finds of sculptures and buildings and
has educational significance on an international level84. The excavations were started

in 1904 by a French engineer, Paul Gaudin, and continued until the middle of the 20th
century with foreign excavation teams. The site was excavated by New York
University after 1961, when Prof. Dr. Kenan Erim started his research on
Aphrodisias85. The ancient city was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO
in 2017. The Temple of Aphrodite, the tetrapylon and the theatre are some of the
outstanding remains of this site.

Figure 2.3. Aphrodisias-Geyre, aerial photograph of the present-day rural landscape
(URL 9)

The village of Geyre, on the other hand, is a rural settlement currently located to the
west of the archeological site. The present-day settlement has its origins in the Old
Geyre Village, the origins of which date back to the 19th century86. The old village
was discovered by the photographer Ara Güler in 1958. The old village was originally
built on the remains of Aphrodisias by using the remains of ancient structures in the
85

URL 10.
It is also stated by Güçer in 2004 that the village was established in 17 th or 18th century. However,
the buildings found on the site in the 1960s were dated back to the 19th century. For further information
see Dinler and İzol, 1983.

construction of the village structures. Quite apart from the archeological remains, the
old village was also valuable for its traditional tissue. This consisted of traditional
buildings with a timber-framed masonry structure using rubble stone, wood lath
(bağdadı), and mudbrick infill (hımış) techniques.
After the documentation of the site by Ara Güler, Aphrodisias attracted the attention
of governmental institutions and issues related to its conservation were then discussed.
Later, the village was expropriated by the Ministry of Culture for the sake of
archeological investigations and the conservation of excavated structures87.
Accordingly, the ‘modern’ village was moved to the west of its original location
within a distance of 2 km, between the years 1960 and 197088. In this process, only a
small number of the traditional buildings were designated89.
The traditional tissue of the former village was destroyed by forcing the local
community to move to another location. The building materials were dismantled. On
the other hand, the designated buildings, which remained in-situ, were assigned to new
functions90. Three of these were documented within the scope of a study conducted in
1983 on the relocation and the exploration of the houses of the village91.
The removal of the rural settlement caused an interruption in the interaction of
Aphrodisias with rural settlement, and archeological site was separated from its sociocultural environment. Likewise, the traditional tissue of the former village of Geyre
was destroyed. In addition, the context of the relationship between the local
community and nature changed, and the organic formation of the settlement
disappeared. In fact, the current morphology of the village is quite different from that
of its predecessor. As a result of a plan prepared for the new settlement in the course

Dinler and İzol, 1983, p. 15.
The removal of the village was also justified by the destructive effects of an earthquake which took
place in 1956: Alpaslan, 2015, p. 83.

(Figure 2.6).

Stratonikeia - Eskihisar
The case of Stratonikeia and Eskihisar represents another significant example of
relocation interventions on rural settlements. The archeological site of Stratonikeia
and the village of Eskihisar are located within the boundaries of the Province of
Muğla. The ancient city of Stratonikeia was included in the Tentative Lists of
UNESCO in 201592. Stratonikeia was continuously inhabited from the Late Bronze
Age until Republican period, and the archeological remains at present visible in the
present-day site, mostly belong to the Hellenic, Roman and Medieval periods93. In
addition, the traditional tissue of the former village of Eskihisar can still be seen on
the site, something also noted in the description by UNESCO94. The buildings
represent the characteristics of the traditional architecture of the territory of Muğla,
with the use of rubble stone and timber as construction materials. Because of the fact
that the village was founded on the archeological remains, the use of spolia is another
characteristic of the traditional buildings on site.

The traditional tissue of the old village of Eskihisar is noted as “remarkable examples of civil
architecture” by its components such as the streets, square, Turkish bath, mosque, coffee-houses
(kahvehane) and commercial buildings: see URL 11.
93

54

In contrast to the case of Aphrodisias – Geyre, earthquakes were the dominant factor
in the relocation of the village, together with the conservation concerns about the
archeological remains. In fact, an earthquake which took place in 1957, caused the
first relocation of the village of old Eskihisar to the northwest of its original location,
where a disaster housing area was designated by the former Ministry of Public Works
and Settlement (Figure 2.8). However, the designation of the 1st and 3rd degree
archeological sites in 1978 also led to the dereliction of the archeological site and the
restrictions on the built environment. In addition, a coal reserve was discovered at this
new location of the village in the 1980s, and the village was relocated once more to
the west, at its current location (Figure 2.7).

Figure 2.8. Aerial photograph showing the relocation of the old village of Eskihisar
in 1974 (Kızıl Aydoğdu, 2012, Figure 3.15)

55

The architectural heritage of the old village of Eskihisar, together with the
archeological remains of Stratonikeia have both been threatened by these two
relocation processes. As in the Geyre case, traditional buildings fall into ruin because
of lack of use and the general dereliction of the site. This has meant that the
archeological site decisions together with the coal mining policies of the governmental
institutions, have destroyed the values of the rural landscape, on which the rural
settlement of Eskihisar and the remains of the ancient city of Stratonikeia once coexisted. The agricultural land surrounding the site, the main economic resource of the
local community, has also been threatened by the coal mining activities. As a result of
these developments, the rural identity of the village of Eskihisar has been
compromised by the interventions in its physical setting and economic activities.

The Thousand and One Churches - Karadağ Region
The Karadağ region is distinguished from its surrounding territory by containing
significant remains of Christian churches together with other structures, such as
residential buildings, cisterns, chamber tombs and other structures95. As also

95

Ramsay and Bell, 2008, p. 7.

56

mentioned by William Mitchell Ramsay in 1891, the villages of Madenşehir and Değle
are located within the remains of the ancient city. These villages are currently located
within the boundaries of the province of Karaman.
Similarly to the former cases, the rural settlements of Madenşehir and Değle have also
been under threat because of the designation of the archeological site regarding the
remains of the Thousand and One Churches in 1976. Although these villages have not
been relocated by the governmental interventions, the local community suffers from
the restrictions on the archeological site. This has meant that even agricultural
activities are prohibited in and around the rural settlements. The villagers engage in
animal husbandry as the only source of income available to them due to these
restrictors on agriculture. As a result of such regulations, the population of the village
of Madenşehir fell after the 1980s, so that the local community left the village and
moved to a new village to the east of its original location.

Figure 2.10. Karadağ Region, aerial view (URL 9)

57

Although the relocation of the rural community is not mandatory under the legal
regulations, the conservation policies of the archeological site of Thousand and One
Churches have affected the villages of Madenşehir and Değle because these
regulations make no allowance for the existence of the local community and its
dependency on particular economic activities96.

Region, together with the modern villages of Madenşehir and Değle (Ramsay and

Rural Settlements Overlapping with Archeological Sites
Forming the second type, overlapping cases represent the most significant examples
of the coexistence of archeological sites and rural settlements. In these cases, parts, or
the entirety of rural settlements are physically intermingled with archeological sites.
The direct interaction and integration between the rural community and archeological
remains can be observed in these cases in terms of both the physical and socio-cultural
structures. One prominent characteristic of these overlapping cases is the historical
layering of the built environment so as to include remains belonging to different
periods. Because of this, new building activities in archeological sites are forbidden
in all the legal regulations after the 1970s. The rural settlements integrated with
archeological sites have generally been established in earlier periods, and incorporate
traditional tissue, with its own historical value. Herakleia ad Latmos-Kapıkırı,
Eryhtrai-Ildır, and Assos-Behramkale have been selected as examples of this type of
coexistence, and discussed below. The cases have been selected from the sites visited
by the author, in order to make evaluations on the overlapping structure.

Herakleia ad Latmos - Kapıkırı
The archeological site of ancient city of Herakleia ad Latmos and the almost congruent
village of Kapıkırı are situated within the boundaries of Milas district of the province
of Muğla.
According to the earliest finds on the site, the region of the ancient city of Herakleia
ad Latmos was inhabited from the prehistoric era until the Ottoman period97. The
village of Kapıkırı became established on the remains of the ancient city from the 18th
century onwards, by nomadic communities originating from the region of the Taurus
Mountains98. Thus, the later settlement contains traditional tissue representing the

local architectural characteristics of the region of Muğla over a period of more than
two hundred years.

and surrounding landscape (URL 9)

In present-day built environment, the physical integration of the rural settlement and
archeological site can be clearly seen in several places, so that, for example, the
remains of the ancient bouleuterion are located in the garden of a residential building.
Similarly, the area of agora is occupied by a contemporary school building currently
serving as a house (Figure 2.14). In fact, the remains of the ancient city are integrated
into, and intermingled with, the daily life of the present rural settlement.

Eryhtrai-Ildır
The case of Eryhtrai and Ildır is another example of an overlapping rural settlement
and archeological site, presenting a strong social and cultural interaction today. The
rural settlement of Ildır and the archeological site of Eryhrai are located within the
boundaries of the Çeşme district of the province of İzmir.

61

Figure 2.15. Erythrai-Ildır, aerial view (URL 9)

The rural settlement of Ildır is located on the coast line to the west of the archeological
site of Erythrai. In the present-day built environment, clearly visible archeological
remains can be observed around the rural settlement, as well as in the ruins of the
acropolis on a hill to the east. The settled area of the village is designated as an urban
historical site with its traditional tissue containing houses, olive oil factories and so
on99. As a result of the coexistence of the rural settlement and archeological site, the
integration of the social fabric of the village with the archeological heritage has
developed. This has even resulted in a festival called “Erythrai - Ildır Culture and Art
Festival” which combines raising awareness about the archeological site and the
economic development of the village, by promoting local products and hosting
tourists100.

Assos-Behramkale
The coexistence of the ancient city of Assos and the village of Behramkale is another
example of the overlap between an archeological site and a rural settlement. The site
is located on the Aegean coast, within the boundaries of the province of Çanakkale.
The archeological site of Assos was included in the tentative lists of UNESCO World
Heritage sites in 2017101.

The ancient city of Assos was first settled in the early Bronze Age and then
continuously inhabited until the Ottoman period102. Although basically a coastal
settlement, the city is actually located on a steep hill with an associated port on the
coast. The acropolis on the summit of the hill stands as a landmark for locating the
ancient city. The rural settlement of Behramkale is an Ottoman settlement, which was
established on the northern side of the acropolis, inside the outer fortifications.
Currently, the rural settlement is designated as urban site due to the authentic nature
of its traditional buildings. The close spatial relationship between the archeological
remains of the ancient city and the present village has become a significant feature of
the rural identity of Behramkale. The integration of the rural settlement and the
archeological site contribute significantly to its attraction as a tourist destination103.

Rural Settlements Detached from Their Archeological Context
Comprising another type of coexistence, rural settlements located in the areas
surrounding archeological sites may still have developed a strong relationship with the
nearby archeological heritage. Although there is no actual physical integration
between these rural settlements and archeological sites, strong elements of sociocultural and economic integration can be observed in these cases arising from the
generation of income from tourism activities, excavation work, and socio-cultural
interactions. In this way, the cases of Çatalhöyük-Küçükköy and Sagalassos-Ağlasun
cases have been selected. In making the case selection, existing studies on the
archeological site management of the sites have been taken as the basis. Both cases
are the most significant examples of successive archeological site management
implementations carried out in Turkey.

Çatalhöyük-Küçükköy
The neolithic archeological site of Çatalhöyük is located within the boundaries of
province of Konya. It was declared as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2012, and
is considered as a significant example of the transition from rural settlements to urban
agglomeration with its unique housing clusters104. The site is located in a rural
landscape, and surrounded by fertile agricultural land, while the present-day rural
settlement, Küçükköy, is located 2km to the north of Çatalhöyük. (Figure 2.20).
Although direct physical interaction does not exist between the rural settlement and
archeological site, a strong socio-economic integration can be observed currently. In
this integration, The Çatalhöyük Management Plan, which was the first management
plan to be carried out in an archeological site in Turkey, played a significant role by
providing significant socio-economic benefits to the surrounding settlements105.

104

The Çatalhöyük Management Plan was prepared in 2004 by the Çatalhöyük Research Centre within
the context of TEMPER (Training, Education, Management, in the Prehistoric Mediterranean) Project.

Figure 2.20. Çatalhöyük-Küçükköy, aerial view (URL 9)

With the policies and practical implementation of the management plan, the rural
development of the village of Küçükköy has been provided, both economically and
socially. In terms of economic development, the existence of the excavation works for
three months in the summer season has proved more effective than the touristic
activities. Because Prehistoric sites in general, are considered to be less attractive to
tourists, the economic benefits generated from tourist activities are not as great as the
employment opportunities presented by the excavation works in the case of
Çatalhöyük-Küçükköy106. These employment opportunities include working on the
implementation of conservation, excavations and excavation house activities, the
supply of local materials, and serving the daily needs of the excavation team and
researchers. As Aylin Orbaşlı notes, a hundred people are employed in excavation

The regulations started to be implemented in 2005, and the results and impacts were evaluated in 2008
and 2012. The TEMPER Project focused on the site management issues in terms of regional
development in the Prehistoric sites in the Eastern Mediterranean. For further information on the
project, see Hodder and Doughty, 2007; see also Orbaşlı, 2014.

works, security, housework and pottery cleaning in the Çatalhöyük excavations every
year for three months (Figure 2.21)107. Beside the economic benefits, the social
contribution of the archeological site to the rural settlement of Küçükköy is significant
and results in greater integration with the archeological site. Book and secondhand
computer donations to the village school, together with the education carried out for
the children are the most significant social contributions of the excavation team
conducted in the archeological site of Çatalhöyük108.

Sagalassos-Ağlasun
The archeological site of Sagalassos is located within the boundaries of the province
of Burdur, and was included in the Tentative Lists of UNESCO in 2009109. Ağlasun
district, with its rural identity, is located 7 km to the southeast of Sagalassos. Despite
the distance, and the rugged nature of the landscape between Ağlasun and Sagalassos,
a strong relationship has grown up, mainly as a result of touristic interest and the

excavation works. The local and foreign tourists visiting the archeological site of
Sagalassos recognize the local value of Ağlasun and other surrounding rural
settlements such as Yeşilbaşköy, Mamak (Çanaklı) and others110. In addition, the
excavations, which have been taking place since the 1990s, have played a significant
role in the economic development of Ağlasun. Together with the increase in touristic
interest mentioned above, the excavations provide an additional source of income to
the rural community. This involves both the opportunity to work on the excavations
as paid workers, and the economic returns from providing board and lodging to the
excavation team. This has also affected the character of the built environment by the
development of accommodation facilities such as apartments and hotels.

Figure 2.22. Sagalassos-Ağlasun, aerial view (URL 9)

There is a growing interest in alternative touristic activities in the region of Ağlasun. This includes
the establishment of itineraries in and around the settlement of Ağlasun, aiming to present the traditional
tissue of the settlement together with the natural values such as springs and streams. These itineraries
also approach the nearby rural settlements, see URL 21.

2.4. Overall Evaluation
Rural landscapes are rich in archeological heritage sites belonging to different
civilizations to the extent that approximately 97% of the designated cultural heritage
sites in Turkey consist of archeological sites111. The evaluation of the historical
process and attitudes towards archeological sites in rural landscapes thus reveals two
main concepts:
First, as a result of conservation approaches existing until the 1980s, the socio-cultural
integrity of archeological sites has been disrupted and the identity of the landscape in
which they are located has changed. In the process of starting from the export and
looting of archeological property, progressing to the single monument conservation
approach, and culminating in a policy of demolishing the surrounding contemporary
built environment, various heritage sites have lost their unique significance. After the
paradigm shift in conservation approaches, the importance of the socio-cultural and
physical environment i.e. rural landscapes was also recognized. Yet, instead of
developing a comprehensive conservation approach, archeological heritage sites were
mostly left to their fate and administrated on the basis of the existing conservation
regulations based on their designated grades. This system of grading archeological
sites, combined with misleading site designations, has faced archeological heritage
with a serious loss of values. In present-day rural landscapes, different categories of
cases exist regarding the relationship between rural settlements and archeological
sites.
Secondly, threats to the cultural sustainability of rural settlements affect the identities
of rural landscapes and their associated cultural heritage. The results of both the
urbanization and counter-urbanization processes have influenced rural landscapes.
The previous socio-cultural characteristics of rural landscapes have either been lost
through the migration to urban settlements or greatly changed by the migration to rural
settlements. The built-up environment has also been effected by the loss of the socio-

111

URL 3.

70

cultural values of local communities’ consequent upon and in conjunction with these
changes.
Thus, the conservation of the archeological remains existing in rural landscapes now
looms as a significant issue concerning the disciplines of architecture, urban and rural
planning, archeology, and sociology. This study thus aims to develop strategies based
on the assessment of the values, threats and potentials of the cases studied. In
conjunction with the typological study, basic criteria are determined for case selection,
and Iasos – Kıyıkışlacık has been selected as a specific case study112.

112

The detailed explanation of the case selection process is given in Chapter 1, p. 9, with the description
of the basic criteria and the evaluation on the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık.

IASOS-KIYIKIŞLACIK: UNDERSTANDING THE INTEGRATION OF THE
ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE AND ITS RURAL SETTING

As an illustrative example to allow an understanding the coexistence of archeological
sites and rural settlements, Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık was selected as a case study, and
analyses regarding it are presented in this chapter. Accordingly, this analysis study is
formulated around three main concepts: historical development, state interventions
and present-day built environment. The analysis of the historical development is
mainly based on a literature survey including the resources regarding archeological
evidence, as well as the material from ancient writers and travelers. State
interventions, on the other hand, are analyzed through the information provided by the
local institutions: the Municipality of Milas, the Metropolitan Municipality of Muğla,
the Museum of Milas, and the Conservation Council of Muğla. Lastly, analyses on the
built environment are based on site surveys.
The analysis on these concepts is carried out in chronological order starting from the
ancient city of Iasos, formation of the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık and the
secondary housing developments in the territory. It should be emphasized that the
aerial photographs provided by the General Directorate of Mapping, and the oral
information provided by the local residents also constitute significant sources for the
analysis of the historical development of the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık. The
outcome of this analytic approach is to identify the dynamics of the site of IasosKıyıkışlacık by a detailed survey of each component of coexistence.

73

3.1. General Features of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık
The site containing the ancient city of Iasos and the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık is
located on the western coast of Turkey, within the boundaries of the Milas district in
the Province of Muğla (Figure 3.1). The distance between the rural settlement of
Kıyıkışlacık and the city center of Milas is nearly 30 km and takes 40 minutes by road.
Milas-Bodrum Airport is also located close by at a distance of 25 km from Kıyıkışlacık
(Figure 3.2).

Figure 3.1. Location of Milas in Turkey and Muğla (URL 22)

Figure 3.2. Location of Kıyıkışlacık (URL 22)

74

The rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık is located on the mainland on the site once
occupied by the Roman necropolis of the ancient city of Iasos. Over the last decade,
increasing building activity has taken place on the eastern and western peripheries of
the rural settlement in the form of secondary housing clusters.

Natural and Geographical Characteristics of the Site
The district of Milas is one of the 3 largest districts of the Province of Muğla and has
a long coastline on the Aegean Sea. The coastal region has numerous gulfs, ports, and
peninsulas. The climate of the area is characteristic of the Mediterranean climate with
hot and dry summers and rainy winters. The effects of the climate can be seen in the
dominant vegetation of the region, with extensive areas of olive groves. Additionally,
tobacco growing and pine forests are also common in the region113. In terms of
mineral resources, marble and quartz can be considered as the main products of the
region. The marble quarries, in particular, have been a source of economic income for
much of the regions history114. The quarry district located on the Karaoğlan Deresi,
near Iasos, is one of the most significant marble quarries on the region115.
Kıyıkışlacık is located on one of the gulfs of the Region, i.e. the Gulf of Mandalya
(Güllük Körfezi). Although the village is settled on a plain land, the coastline can be
considered mountainous by the existence of Ilbıra (Grion) Mountains. As a result,
accessibility of the settlement is considerably difficult from the land. The promontory
on which Iasos is located is a steep, and rocky hill rising to a height of 80 m. The
western slopes of the promontory are considerably steeper in comparison to the
southern and eastern parts. The elevation values exceed 70% on the western slopes,
while only reaching a maximum of 40% on the eastern section (Figure 3.53). On the
other hand, the mainland is flat on the northern side of the promontory, surrounded by

two hills to the southeast and west that are part of the foot hills of the Ilbırı (Grion)
Mountain Range. However, the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık was established on the
eastern slopes of the hill on the west of the promontory due to the fertility of the flat
land, and relatively lower elevations. In fact, this territory has been serving the rural
settlement as its basic economic resource since the 1930s116. Even so, these fertile
lands have been encroached upon by the new development areas of Kıyıkışlacık.
The nature of the vegetation in and around Kıyıkışlacık includes large olive groves.
This olive production has played a significant role in the economic development of
Kıyıkışlacık. Olives are produced either by individuals or companies, such as Asın
Farm or Akarca Farm, and these farms have a considerable reputation in the olive
market. Apart from olive groves, pastures used for the animal husbandry which is the
secondary economic activity, and different fruit orchards and vegetable gardens for
the production of seasonal fruits are other components of the vegetation in the region.

A Brief Archeological Description of Iasos
The ancient city of Iasos was a Carian settlement, located on the west coast of Asia
Minor in the Roman Province of Caria. This location around a safe harbor on the Gulf
of Mandalya, provided a strategic advantage in maritime activities117. The presence of
Iasos dominated the region, along with Bargylia, in ancient times, so that the Gulf of
Mandalya was mentioned in the ancient sources as either the Gulf of Iasos or the Gulf
of Bargylia118.

Figure 3.4. Carian Settlements (Henry, 2009, Figure 1)

117

The location and wider geography had a significant effect on the development of Iasos by endowing
it with strategic importance. The importance of this strategic location of Iasos is noted by Foss (1987,
p. 213) as the indented coastline and being located at the intersection of shipping routes. In addition,
the advantages of the location provided constant encouragement for human settlement over the years.
Fede Berti (1993, p. 119) emphasizes the importance of the location in the explanation of the 3000
years of existence of Iasos. She summarizes these facts such as the strategic location of Iasos in the
Gulf of Mandalya, the densely populated hinterland of Iasos, and surrounding natural resources and a
sea offering abundant quantities of fish.

Figure 3.5. The peninsula of Iasos, drawing by Texier (1862, Pl. 142)

The polis and chora of the ancient city of Iasos were located on a small peninsula and
the mainland behind, respectively. As mentioned earlier, the steep and rocky peninsula
was joined to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. Such was the view of Strabo who
notes that: “Iasos lies on an island close to the mainland”119. The existence of a narrow
channel can also be seen in the drawings by Texier in 1862 (Figure 3.5). The peninsula

78

must have been contiguous with the mainland once, so that the narrow channel can
now be seen as a low point in the isthmus. It extends towards the sea on the south and
the length of the promontory is 1 km.
There are two natural harbors to the west and east of the promontory. The western
harbor is known as the Little Harbor, and there are two piers at the entrance to this
harbor, which were built in the Roman Imperial Period120. The one that is located on
the south of the promontory was occupied by a Middle Byzantine Tower dated to the
10th or 11th century. The harbor facing the eastern section of the gulf is the Big Harbor.
The promontory is occupied by the intra-urbem site of Iasos, i.e. the polis. There are
three fortification systems on the promontory: one surrounding the peninsula, another
surrounding the acropolis, and the castle of Isthmus on the northern section of the
peninsula. Although a limited section of the fortification surrounding the peninsula
can still be observed today on the coastline of the promontory, the former layout can
be seen from the drawings of Texier. There are two main entrance gates to this
fortification system: The first one is located at the northern entrance of the site, and
the second one faces the Big Harbor and is known as the East Gate. The second
fortification system surrounds the acropolis located at highest point of the peninsula.
The acropolis contains the remains of a cistern and a building which is thought to have
been a Hellenistic temple121. The third fortification system, the castle on the Isthmus,
occupies the flat land on the northwest of the promontory. The area surrounded by
these walls has not been excavated, but archeological surveys shown that there are
many vestiges awaiting exploration122.
One of the most visible and significant areas of the promontory is the agora, which
has considerable historical layering due its occupation by successive settlements123.
Once, one of the earliest settlements on the promontory was located in this area, and

was settled from the Bronze Age to the Late Byzantine Period. The area is located
near the gate on the north of the promontory, and contains the remains of several public
buildings including the archeological remains from the Bronze Age, the bouleuterion,
and an Early Christian basilica. The flat land on the northeast side of the peninsula is
accessed from the agora and it is occupied by various structures such as the Sanctuary
of Zeus Megistos, building complexes inside the East Gate, and two churches.
The northeast and south slopes of the promontory are occupied by the remains of the
residential buildings of the ancient city, since the ground here has a much gentler slope
compared to the west side of the promontory. These residential quarters are
distinguishable by being located on either natural or artificial terraces on the slopes124.
In addition, the streets themselves have been revealed with their infrastructural
systems by the excavations125. One of the most significant buildings in the
archeological site of Iasos is the House of Mosaics, which is located on the southern
slopes. This Roman villa is famous for its mosaic floors and frescoes on its walls126.
On the northeast slopes, the theatre is located, but only its layout can now be observed
due to its seats and marble revetments having been removed to İstanbul127.
The extra-urbem site of Iasos is located on the plain on the mainland surrounded by
the Grion Mountain Range. The Roman necropolis of Iasos was located in this area,
together with an impressive array of fortification walls128. This fortification system,
i.e. the Mainland Wall, covers a large area on the northwest of the mainland and was
constructed in trapezoidal isodomic masonry with many towers, which are of semicircular shape129. The existence of the necropolis has dominated the character of the
mainland from Prehistoric period to the 19th century130. However, the area was later
occupied by the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık. A small number of remaining

chamber tombs can be observed today. There are three monumental chamber tombs
on the mainland. The first one, the so-called Clock Tower, is located at the entrance
of the village. As it was also in ancient periods, it stands as a landmark of the mainland
settlement by its form and location. The so-called Balık Pazarı is another monumental
chamber tomb located near the isthmus. This peristyle building with a courtyard was
a mausoleum and has now been transformed into a museum. Similarly, the last
monumental chamber tomb has been restored and converted into a service building
for the excavation house. It is located on the coastline facing the Little Harbor. There
are other remains in the area surrounding the so-called Balık Pazarı, such as the
remaining parts of an aqueduct, and a three-aisled basilica131.

3.2. Historical Development
As mentioned earlier, the geographic and strategic position of the site was the major
factor in the area being inhabited continuously since the Prehistoric period. In fact, the
ancient city of Iasos, has had a political and economic existence for more than 3000
years132. The site that was formerly occupied by a Carian settlement, i.e. the ancient
city of Iasos, was later occupied by the village of Kıyıkışlacık and is now confronted
with the new construction of secondary houses, pensions and resorts. Within this
history of settlement and development, the coexistence of the archeological site and
the rural settlement forms a heterogeneous structure: the ancient city of Iasos, as the
first settlement at site, the village of Kıyıkışlacık with a direct relationship with the
remains of Iasos and the new development areas of secondary housing (Figure 3.6).
In the context of this thesis, the presentation of the historical development of the site
is interpreted differently from the general approaches to historic research, i.e. the
determination of historical periods. Thus, a chronological order is provided in terms
of the formation of different components rather than the classification of the built

132

Berti, 1993, p. 119.

81

environment into periods like the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine or Ottoman. The
basic logic underlying this is the absence of written resources regarding the
development of the present day rural settlement, which are crucial for a proper
historical research.

Formation of the Ancient City of Iasos

Historical Framework
Dominated by geographical advantages, as mentioned above, the area has a settlement
history going back to Prehistoric times. The historic sources emphasize the advantages
the sea provided both for fishing and transportation. As also noted by Strabo, the
influence of the sea was an important consideration in the foundation of Iasos, the
main economic activity on which it depended being fishing. In addition, a legend about
the importance of fishing activities at Iasos has survived until today133. In contrast to
the region’s continuous settlement history, historical sources are considered by
scholars to be virtually silent about Iasos134. Since the name of Iasos does not appear
in any historic document until the 5th century BCE, its foundation based on a legend
is accepted by many scholars135.
According to the legend, Iasos was founded by Greek colonists from Argos in the first
half of the 7th century BCE. However, the colonists faced resistance from the local
people when they arrived, and sought help from Neleus, son of Miletus. The origins
of the name “Iasos” is also based on this legend. A coin belonging to the Roman
Imperial period refers to Iasus, leader of the colony, with the title KTICTHC meaning
“the founder Iasos”136.

Strabo (14,2,21) mentions a story about the importance of fishing for the citizens: “When a
citharoede was giving a recital, the people all listened for a time, but when the bell that announced the
sale of fish rang, they all left him and went away to the fish market, except one man who was hard of
hearing. The citharoede, therefore, went up to him and said: "Sir, I am grateful to you for the honor you
have done me and for your love of music, for all the others except you went away the moment they
heard the sound of the bell." And the man said, "What's that you say? Has the bell already rung?" And
when the citharoede said "Yes," the man said, "Fare thee well," and himself arose and went away.” For
the English translation see Jones, 1928, p. 291.

Although the legend associates the foundation of Iasos with the arrival of the
colonizers in the first half of the 7th century BCE, archeological findings indicate that
the site was occupied at an earlier period. In fact, the earliest archeological evidence
dates back to the Early Bronze Age, and indicates two different settlements: around
the necropolis located on the promontory, and on the upper slopes of the island, dating
back to 3000 BCE. In addition, archeological finds in the area of the agora indicate
the existence of an inhabitation, which is dated to the Middle Bronze Age137.
Despite the legends and findings, written sources relates the existence of Iasos in the
tribute lists of the Attika-Delos Confederacy in the 5th century BCE138. Iasos faced
serious attacks and occupations in that period of time. As with other settlements in
Anatolia, Iasos came under the domination of the Persians after the confirmation of
the King’s Peace supporting Persian superiority in Anatolia in 387 BCE139. In its
reality, the Persian domination was considered as a physical and sociological disaster
by Abuzer Kızıl140. This process of destruction continued until 334-332 BCE when
the city obtained its independence under Alexander the Great, as did the rest of
Caria141. Although the city had suffered from various assaults, the public buildings
and sacred places increased in number at the end of the 4th century BCE. Later, a

physical renewal process started and the improvements in significant places, such as
the agora, gained importance142.
Another period of development occurred in 168-129 BCE when Caria was included
in the Roman Province of Asia143. After that period, the city went into decline
following serious earthquakes, slave raids and pirate attacks. However, the strategic
position of Iasos provided an opportunity for the city to become a customs center for
the province144. As a result, welfare and physical conditions were improved during the
Roman occupation. According to Daniela Baldoni, these improvements included large
construction projects, repairs, and improvement to public buildings in the form of
enlargements and ornamentations, increase in the numbers of civic buildings, water
supplies and so on. The renovation of the bouleuterion, the use of frescos and mosaics
on the House of Mosaics date back to this development process145. In the Early
Christian Period, Iasos became the suffragan bishopric of Aphrodisias and new
building activities continued to take place in the city146.
However, the Persian and Arab attacks between the middle of the 7th century and the
9th century, had destructive effects on Asia Minor, and Iasos appears to have been
affected by these incursions147. Berti also notes that Iasos witnessed tragic and difficult
times in this process148. The Arabs left the region in the 9th century, and the Caria
region was occupied by the Seljuk Turks at the end of the 11th century (1093-1095),
following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and their subsequent occupation of
Anatolia149. However, it was only in the second half of the 13th century that the
Byzantine presence in Western Asia Minor was finally ended with the establishment

of the Menteşe Principality150. These developments left their traces in Iasos in the
remains on the castle of Isthmus and the Middle Byzantine Tower on the Little Harbor,
which were erected for defensive purposes151. From the 1390s, when the domination
of the Ottoman Empire was established, the area has remained under the control of the
Turks152. There are remains belonging to the early periods of the Ottoman Empire,
which were uncovered in the burial area of the basilica of the agora which indicate the
presence of a limited population in this period153. As many scholars emphasize, some
monuments suffered damage in the Ottoman period, such as stone blocks belonging
to the theater removed from Iasos and carried to Istanbul to be used in port
construction in 1887154.
Regarding the known information about the settlement history, the ancient city has
been continuously occupied since the Prehistoric period until the Roman, Byzantine
and even early Ottoman periods. As a result, Iasos can be considered as a meeting
point of different cultures over thousands of years.

Research History: Ancient Writers, Travelers and Scholars
Iasos had drawn the interest of the ancient writers by reason of its sepulchers during
the Peloponnesian War, much earlier than the well-known travelers’ visits155.
Thucydides mentions the search for and discovery of Carian sepulchers in his book by
describing a specific incident156. He notes that sepulchers belonging to earlier periods
were revealed accidentally at a religious ceremony that the Athenians performed at
the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. The sepulchers were thought to be Carian,

so other examples were subject to a research in the coastal region of Caria, including
Iasos157.
Strabo (14,2,21) notes that Iasos was an island close to the mainland and emphasizes
the abundance of fish. In fact, the main economic sources of income of the city had
depended on the sea because of the previously thought infertility of the land:
“Then one comes to Iasus, which lies on an island close to the mainland.
It has a harbor; and the people gain most of their livelihood from the
sea, for the sea here is well supplied with fish, but the soil of the country
is rather poor.”158
Following Strabo, travelers such as Richard Chandler and Edward Lee Hicks, had
emphasized the poorness of the soil. However, the region is now considered to be rich
in olive trees and economic benefits based on olive oil productions. The fertility of the
land was later emphasized by Charles Texier in reference to the marshy and favorable
surrounding plain providing the production of all types of grain159.
In the 16th century, Piri Reis mentioned Iasos in his Kitab-ı Bahriye in a chapter about
the coastal area of Acı Su, i.e. the Gulf of Mandalya 160. He emphasizes the ruinous
state of the city and gives information about the fortifications and natural environment:
“…is a large ruined castle that they call Asin, in the center of which has
been constructed another. This larger castle, they say was built by order
of a recent sultan and it is still standing… Before these castles, there is
an artificial harbor at the entrance to which the late Sultan Beyazid Han
had a bastion constructed. This bastion still stands. Four miles north of
this harbor is a lagoon that they call Acı Su. This place resembles a lake.
It measures ten miles in circumference but its northern, northwestern
and eastern sides are shallow. There are also reed beds and marshes
here”161

In 1673, the English travelers Pickering and Salter passed through the Meander Valley
during their visit to the Seven Churches of Apocalypse162. The route of the tour
included Iasos and Mylasa. Although they did not mention Iasos, the place called
Asemkalesi was later related with Iasos by George Wheler according to the
descriptions of Strabo163.
Richard Chandler’s visit to Caria was significant since it provided a detailed
description of Iasos. Doro Levi identifies Chandler as the earliest discoverer of
Iasos164. A chapter was dedicated to Caria and Iasos in his book Travels in Asia Minor
in 1775. This chapter includes detailed geographical information of Iasos described it
as a small island connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. The richness of the
sea in terms of the abundance of fish, was also emphasized by Chandler. Similarly to
Strabo, Chandler paid attention to the poorness of the soil. Additionally, some plant
and animal species that they observed on the island were mentioned:
“…and then along the shore, arrived at Iasus, now called Assyn-Kalesi.
The Iasians were a colony of Argives and afterwards of Milesians. Their
city covered a rocky islet lying near the continent, to which it is now
united by a small isthmus and was only ten stadia or a mile and a quarter
in circumference. It had a port and was maintained by the sea, which
abounded in fish; its territory being rough and barren… Single pinks,
with jonquilles, grew among the thickets of mastic; and we sprung some
large coves of partridges, which feed on the berries.”165
This chapter also includes an informative depiction of the intra-urbem area of Iasos
and its fortification walls. Inscriptions regarding the theatre and a vaulted edifice are
also given at the end of the book:
“The north side of the rock of Iasus is abrupt and inaccessible. The
summit is occupied by a mean but expensive fortress. At the foot is a
small portion of flat ground. On that and on the acclivities the houses
once stood, within a narrow compass, bounded to the sea by the city
wall, which was regular, solid and handsome, like that of Ephesus. This,

which has been repaired in many places, now encloses rubbish, with
remnants of ordinary buildings and a few pieces of marble….In the side
of the rock is the theatre, fronting 60m east of north with many rows of
seats remaining, but covered with soil or enveloped in bushes. On the
left wing is an inscription in very large and well-formed characters,
ranging in a long line and recording certain donations to Bachus and the
people. Beneath, near the bottom, are several stones inscribed, but not
legible. By the isthmus is the vaulted subtraction of a considerable
edifice; and on a jamb of the doorway are decrees engraved in a fair
character, but damaged and black with smoke; the entrance, which is
lessened by a pile of stones, serving as a chimney to a few Greeks, who
inhabit the ruin. Opposite to the isthmus is a flat point running out into
the sea, with a small square fort at the extremity.”166
The mainland was also described for the first time in Chandler’s writings. He notes
the area across the isthmus is a plain, with numerous chamber tombs, and gives
detailed information about the construction techniques and materials of the buildings.
One of the most important pieces of information that Chandler provides is that Greeks
occupied the area in the 1770s, when he visited Iasos. Although the city was in a ruined
state, a few sepulchers and edifices were inhabited by the Greeks167.
In 1782, the French traveler Choiseul Gouffier visited the site and wrote down his
observations with a few sentences in his book Voyage Pittoresque dans L’Empire
Ottoman. He mentions the site as Assem-Kalesi – Iasus168. More detailed information
was given by Charles Texier, who visited the site in the 1830s, in his book Description
de L’Asie Mineure. The site was abandoned and in a ruined state, when he arrived at
Iasos. Even the few Greek families mentioned by Chandler were not there. He
described Iasos as a town situated on an island and drew a plan of the city (Figure 3.5).
The richness of the sea was also emphasized by Texier. Although the rich fishing
opportunities of the sea were a common observation of the travelers, Texier takes a
different view of the fertility of the land. As mentioned above, the plain was

considered as fertile ground with its marshy nature and olive trees covering the
peninsula, according to Texier’s observations169.
Texier provides detailed drawings and descriptions of the intra-urbem and the extraurbem structures of Iasos. Two different chapters were dedicated to the fortification
walls in which the construction materials and structural conditions are recorded. In
addition, façade and plan drawings, information regarding the inscriptions of some
structures such as the theatre, stadium and palaestra were all provided by Texier. For
the mainland, he wrote a chapter entitled “Sepulchers” and provided a historical
analysis of the chamber tombs170. He described the general appearance of sepulchers
as “houses which creates a small city” and thus emphasizes the large number of
chamber tombs.
As noted by several scholars, on the one hand, Texier provided a significant and
detailed information about the fortifications, intra-urbem structures and extra-urbem
necropolis, while on the other hand, he seriously damaged the remains by setting the
olive trees and bushes on fire in order to better observe the ruins171.
The document that Edward Lee Hicks provided in the 1880s stands as a significant
source of information about the city’s history172. A detailed examination of the
inscriptions, with the original texts, and their explanations are provided in this
document, and it remains as an important source for researchers. The historical
development of Iasos was analyzed by Hicks in terms of the religious, legal, economic
and social features of the city. To do this, he examined the daily life routines and
historical events with information provided by the inscriptions. Apart from historical
information, Hicks gives some geographical and physical descriptions of city as well.
A definition of the island with its surrounding geography and emphasis on fishing
activities can be given as an example. Even the necropolis was depicted in one part by

pointing out that the burial places had to be on mainland because the whole island was
occupied by urban functions173.
Georges Cousin and Gaston Deschamps were also interested in the inscriptions, and
their journey from Miletus to Physcos included Iasos where they examined some of
the inscriptions and recorded the original texts in their documentation174. The
promontory where Iasos is located was still surrounded by the fortifications in 1887
when Walther Judeich visited the site175. He drew sketches and plans of the walls and
provided original copies of some inscriptions at the end of his text176.
The inscriptions and monuments were also subject to examination by different
travelers in the first half of the 20th century, including Krischen, Guidi and Robert177
until 1960, when excavations on the promontory were started. These studies include
descriptions of the monuments178 and some theories developed about the fortifications
on the mainland179.
Ancient geographers and travelers were interested in Iasos because of its strategic
location on one of the bays of the Carian coastal line. Although Strabo gives detailed
information about the historical accounts of many cities, he barely mentioned Iasos.
Yet, after the second half of the 19th century, travelers that visited Iasos wrote
voluminously about the place and its remains providing much detailed information180.
The excavations which offer a great amount of high quality information about the
settlement and surrounding environment only started later in 1960181.

Development of the Rural Settlement
Research on the historical development of the rural settlement is constrained by the
absence of written sources. In fact, only regional resources shed light on the historical
developments around Kıyıkışlacık. As mentioned earlier, there is evidence on both the
promontory and the mainland indicating the continuity of life through into the
Ottoman period, such as cisterns, production units and burials. However, at the end of
the 18th century, when Chandler visited the site, there was no indication of an
organized rural settlement. Until the establishment of Asın Kurin after the foundation
of the Turkish Republic, the site remained in its ruined state. As a result, rather than
attempting a chronological historical research, the establishment of different phases
of the rural settlement are analyzed in this study. Accordingly, three phases are
identified as; the foundation of Asın Kurin, the development of Kıyıkışlacık and
archeological investigations on Iasos. Information about these phases has been
provided by later travelers, in-depth interviews with local residents and aerial
photographs taken in different years and utilizes to compensate for the lack of written
sources.
The first indications of the existence of a modern settlement are derived from
Chandler; when, according to his observations at the end of the 18th century, Iasos had
been abandoned and was in a state of ruin. Chandler emphasizes the ruined state of
site while mentioning the presence of a few Greek families on the mainland.
Commissioned to protect the remains of Iasos, these families lived in the ancient
chamber tombs which remained in a relatively in a good condition among the remains
of the demolished necropolis. Chandler’s observations are given below:
“On our first arrival here, a Greek, who lived in the ruin of a large
sepulcher by the isthmus, declared he was commanded to suffer nobody
to enter Assyn-Kalesi without a written order from the aga of Melasso,
to whose district the castle belonged… This sepulcher was then our
abode, and we lay in it, covering, with the Greek family, the whole
floor.”182
182

Chandler, 1775, pp. 229-230.

92

Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the first signs of habitation after the
earlier abandonment of Iasos were seen by Chandler on the mainland, characterized
by the use of the chamber tombs located on the slopes of the hill. However, the 18 th
century traveler Texier notes the absence of Greek inhabitatants. In fact, the ruined
site was completely abandoned, and Texier did not record even the traces left by the
Greek families who had inhabited the chamber tombs.
Tracing the occupancy of site the using travelers’ observations and oral information
provided by the local residents, it can be assumed that the site remained abandoned
until after the population exchange between Turkey and Greece in 1923. According to
the protocol dated 30 January 1923, i.e. the Lausanne Agreement, Muğla, as with other
cities of Turkey, became home to immigrants returning from the Balkans 183. The
presence of the current rural settlement is considered to be an outcome of this
demographic change. However, due to the lack of the written sources, the occupancy
of the site before the 1920s remains uncertain.

Asin Kurin: The Early Settlement
The presence of a nearby farm located in the fertile hinterland of Iasos was a factor in
the development a rural settlement on the mainland (Figure 3.8). According to the
information given by the current landowners, the farm presently known as Asın Farm
or Akarca Farm, was established in the 17th century184. Until the population exchange
following the foundation of the Turkish Republic, the farm was occupied by Greeks.
Following the population exchange, all the land of the farm was bought by a prominent
family from Milas, i.e. the Akarca Family. In this transfer of land, the workers on the
earlier farm were forced off the land. Locals who had been living and working in Asın
183

Akça, 2008, p. 17.
The farm was originally known as Asın Farm before the transfer of the whole of the land to Mehmet
Ali Akarca after the population exchange. Accordingly, the farm started to be known as Akarca Farm
and parts of the land were farmed separately by family members. Today, there are two different
establishments called Asın Farm and Akarca Farm run by different members of the family (this
information was provided by İpek Akarca who is the manager of Asın Farm).
184

93

Farm were sent to the part of the mainland which was occupied by the Roman
necropolis of Iasos. With the aid of this information given by the locals as a basic
source, it could be assumed that presence of the chamber tombs might have been the
main land selection criterion for the workers. In fact, the chamber tombs functioned
as a shelter for the Greeks in the first phase of the settlement, as noted by Chandler.
In the descriptions of the mainland left by travelers, the Roman necropolis was
perceived as a small settlement dominating the land from the sea to the foothills of the
mountains. The ruined chamber tombs had thus provided shelter for the workers and
active rural life started involving the integration of the archeological remains on the
mainland.

Figure 3.8. Location of Asın Farm within the territory (URL 9)

As mentioned before, the chamber tombs are considered to be the key elements in
connecting between different historical periods. Upon the arrival of the local residents
from Asın Farm, visual and structural condition of these chamber tombs should not be
quite different than how they look in the drawings of Texier, produced at the end of
the 19th century (Figure 3.9). Ruined chamber tombs, as well as these in a better state
of preservation, were subject to repair, and alterations to serve as shelters at the

94

beginning of the occupancy. For instance, chamber tombs without roof were covered
with greng soil on timber bearing elements185. With some alterations such as the
enlargement of the tombs for the needs of daily life and population growth, locals
inhabited the remains of the Roman necropolis for many years and thus the first rural
settlement of Asin Kurin was established. In fact, the name “Asın Kurin” reflects the
origins of both villagers and built environment of the village. “Asın” refers to the name
of the nearby farm as well as the remains of Iasos as being mentioned by travelers, as
“Assyn-Kalesi” and “Asem Kalesi”186. “Kurin” on the other hand is the combination
of “kuru in” which refers to the cave-like chamber tombs, as dry and windowless187.

By the building of new structures next to the chamber tombs, over time, the village
started to grow. This growth happened due to population growth of individual
families, and the chamber tombs alone became inadequate as a source of shelter. As a
result, traditional village houses were built next to the chamber tombs, which remained
in use as residential units for some time. In the selection of the location for the new
housing, an appropriate distance to the chamber tombs, now to be used as service
buildings played a crucial role (Figure 3.10 and Figure 3.12). Accordingly, the
chamber tombs were not abandoned, but continued to be an integral part of daily
activities. Some of these original houses have survived until this day (Figure 3.11).
Chimneys, timber beams and flat earth roofs are the significant characteristics of these
stone masonry buildings188. These new buildings were either built onto an existing
chamber tomb, using its foundations, or in completely new locations. Traces of the
foundations of chamber tombs are still visible today. Moreover, building materials
were taken from the remains of Iasos and used as spolia in both buildings and
courtyard elements (Figure 3.13).
At this point, it would be useful to mention the opinions of different scholars. Doro
Levi emphasized that the selection of the land for the rural settlement on the necropolis
and agricultural activities on both the promontory and the mainland, had significant
effects on research, resulting in the removal of the remains before the beginning of the
excavations189. Similarly, Berti notes that the development of the rural settlement of
Kıyıkışlacık seriously changed the pattern of the necropolis190. These opinions of the
scholars about the selection of the location for the rural settlement is accurate. The
establishment of a rural settlement on the remains of the Roman necropolis resulted in
the loss of archeological values, and the identity of the mainland, which was described

188

as the “city of tombs” by Guidi, Chandler and Texier. Currently, there are only 19
remaining chamber tombs, which have been subjected to major alterations191.

Kıyıkışlacık: The Present-day Rural Settlement
Although the exact date of the change of the name of the village from Asin Kurin to
Kıyıkışlacık cannot be identified, however, using the lists of villages which were
published periodically by the Ministry of Interior (T.C. İç İşleri Bakanlığı) and sources
regarding Milas, an approximate period can be determined. Accordingly, the name is
thought to have changed between the years 1954 and 1965192. In fact, the change of
the name of Asin Kurin, as in the cases of many other settlements, was based on Act
No: 7267, which aimed to transform foreign names into Turkish193. This act was
issued in 1959 and the list of villages published in 1968 presents the results of this
action in terms of both the old and new names of the villages. In these lists, the village
was recorded as Kıyıkışlacık, and its former name Asin Kurin was indicated as well.
The origins of the new name Kıyıkışlacık are said by the local residents to be derived
from the customs station located on the coastline facing the Little Harbor. “Kıyı”
refers to its location, while “Kışlacık” refers to the existence of a small group of
soldiers in the customs station. The change of name also indicates these developments
occurred in the early rural settlement Asin Kurin. In fact, Kıyıkışlacık refers to a
developing modern rural settlement by means of its socio-economic aspects, while
Asin Kurin reflects the image of the old village194.
The evolution of this socio-economic development process can be traced back to the
establishment of olive oil factories within the rural settlement in the 1970s, together
with the construction of the school, local mosque and increasing building activities on

192

The background of this research includes the Lists of Villages belonging to years 1933, 1946, 1968
and 1981 published by Ministry of Interior; population census records belonging to 1935 and 1965 and
the book Milas Coğrafyası, Tarih ve Arkeolojisi (Akarca and Akarca, 1954). The village first appears
as “Asin” in the Village List in 1933, and “Asin Kurin” in 1946. Likewise, the village was mentioned
as “Kurin” in Akarca and Akarca (1954, p. 148.). However, the name of the village changed in 1965,
being recorded as Kıyıkışlacık in population consensus.

the peripheries (Figure 3.14)195. As mentioned earlier, olive cultivation has been the
basic economic activity of the area since ancient times. With respect to the resources
that nature provides, locals maintained increasing olive cultivation and extended their
activities by building the factories to extract the oil. Three olive oil plants served the
entire village until a decade ago196. However, the improvement in economic activity
is not the only reason for the socio-economic and physical development of the rural
settlement seen in the 1970s. Archeological excavations, which were started in 1960
and continued until 2013, had a great impact on both the socio-cultural and economic
structure of the village.

Archeological Investigations at Iasos: Excavation and Field Survey
The archeological excavation of Iasos started in 1960 as one of the earliest Italian
excavations conducted in Turkey. In fact, Arslantepe, Hierapolis, Iasos and Topaklı
were the first Italian excavations to take place as the result of an Italian-Turkish
collaboration on archeological studies after the Second World War197. The importance
of the Iasos excavations was emphasized by Ekrem Akurgal as “one of the most
successful field operations carried out on the western coast of Anatolia”198. The
contribution of this excavation to the exploration of other Carian settlements in
western Anatolia was also noted by Akurgal.
The archeological excavations started in 1960 under the auspices of the Turkish
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (T.C. Dış İşleri Bakanlığı) and Associazione Iassos di
Caria and were supported by different organizations over the years199. In fact, Doro
Levi, as a representative of the Italian Archeological School at Athens, was the first
Italian archeologists to take an interest in Iasos and the excavations started under his
leadership. He was motivated by the idea of finding a connection with the Minoan
civilization of Crete. The reasons for the selection of Iasos were clarified by Levi
himself as it being located in a strategical position, the attractiveness of the remains
and the modest scale of the city200.
The Iasos excavations were directed by Doro Levi until 1972, when Clelia Laviosa
took over the leadership for the following 13 years starting in 1972 until 1984. In 1985,
Fede Berti, who was then the director of the National Museum of Ferrara, became the
director of the Iasos excavation. She remained as the field director for 27 years as the
longest serving leader in the Iasos excavations. After her retirement in 2010, Marcello
Spanu worked at Iasos between 2011 and 2013. However, the permission for
excavations was not renewed by the Turkish authorities in 2013 and the campaign

remained limited to a detailed documentation process including general maps, detailed
plans and planning future investigations aiming to focus on and understand the overall
situation. This documentation process can be claimed as an important part of the
fieldwork by recording 216 ancient monuments and structures discovered since the
beginning of archeological studies. Such a work is crucial in terms of both its
archeological importance and the protection of the site by creating a base map, which
however, does not include latest finds. In addition, new analytic studies on the main
monuments were carried out, and a new plan of the promontory was produced using
innovative technologies201. Although the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism
designated the Museum of Milas and Prof. Dr. Asuman Baldıran as having
responsibility for excavations in 2014, there has not been any fieldwork conducted at
Iasos since 2013.
The Iasos excavations mostly concentrated on the promontory which is defined as the
polis of Iasos. However, important areas and monuments on the mainland were also
discovered. Monumental tombs, a pre-historic necropolis and the remains of an
aqueduct were studied. Of these, the monumental tombs, known as Balık Pazarı, the
Clock Tower and the Macedonian were all restored. The latter has served the
excavation team, together with the nearby relatively modest chamber tomb, as a base
since 2001202. In addition, the field studies have included different research and
implementation methods such as underwater excavations203, VES electric surveys204
and GPS and DTM (digitally produced map) for map production.
Having been under excavation for 53 years, significant scientific studies and
organizations have been established concerning Iasos. In particular, the published
works of the various directors of the excavation teams present the process and outcome
of the fieldworks and contribute to the scientific field as the main resources about

Iasos. The book Iasos Kazıları by Doro Levi (1986) is prominent as the first study to
be published on the archeological remains. Similarly, the annual reports of fieldwork
written by Laviosa, Berti and Spanu give information about the development of the
scientific studies. Besides professional publications, small booklets as visitor guide
books, have been outstanding productions of the team205. Likewise, numerous
publications and reports have been carried out by different scholars specializing in
different disciplines who had worked as team members in Iasos excavations. A series
of a bulletin was also published annually by the Associazione Iasos di Caria between
the years 1995 and 2016. These bulletins include research by the team members.
Although the documents are in Italian, their contribution to the visibility and
documentation of Iasos is certainly substantial. Another outcome provided by the
Italian Excavation Team at Iasos has been the annual conferences organized since
2008 i.e. “Caria, the Carians and Milas”. The conference gathers together different
scholars working on Caria. The program included a trip to Iasos when it was started
in 2008 and created an opportunity for awareness raising206. The 3rd conference was
particularly significant for Iasos because it included a musical entertainment
conducted at Iasos for the 50th anniversary of the excavation campaign. Likewise, a
symposium called “50 Years of the Italian Archeological Mission of Iasos. Iasos and
its Territory” took place in İstanbul in 2011. The 50th anniversary events also included
an exhibition called “Wandering Marbles: Marbles of Iasos at the Istanbul Archeology
Museums” at Istanbul207. This exhibition is another outcome of the detailed research
on Iasos and was followed by the publication of a book208.
One of the most important aspects of the fieldwork is the social interaction that takes
place with the local community. The earliest attempt of social interaction took place
in 2000 as an organized event for primary school students. They visited the agora,

house of mosaics and Balık Pazarı. This event was continued in the following years
as a traditional school day at Iasos. The events conducted in different years included
different social activities. For instance, the “Agora Kermesse Day” was organized in
2006 with the cooperation of school teachers and the excavation team. Traditional
dances, poems, recitals, the legend of Hermias and the dolphin and workshops were
the main activities. The performances took place in the bouleuterion, the narration of
the old stories about Iasos were seen as crucial for linking the past and future already
connected by nature209. The day was dedicated to students and defined as “a lively and
enjoyable day” by Berti (Figure 3.15).

Figure 3.15. Photographs taken on the school day organizations in 2000 (Berti, 2002,
Figure 5 [left]) and 2006 (Berti, 2008, Figure 8 [right])

As mentioned above, the excavations concentrated on the promontory and attention to
the surrounding topography was limited. However, a study focusing on the hinterland
of Iasos “Archeological Survey of the Gulf of Mandalya” was initiated in 1988 and
lasted for 22 years until 2011. The project started under the direction of Eugenio La

Rocca and was continued by Raffaella Pierobon Benoit from the University of Naples
Federico II. The archeological survey covered an area of 72km2 in which it was
possible to analyze the relationship between the urban settlement of Iasos (polis) and
its hinterland (chora)210 (Figure 3.16). This was the first time a study had been carried
out concerning the territorial relations of the gulf. Thus, the results of the archeological
survey were stunning by providing significant information about the historical account
of surrounding settlements and socio-economic relations.

Figure 3.16. Territorial Map of the Archeological Survey of the Gulf of Mandalya
(Pierobon Benoit, 2012, Figure 2)

The archeological survey confirmed the presence of numerous settlements connected
by a dense network of roads211. Continuously cultivated land, farms, remains of small
settlements and ongoing agricultural activities showed that the area was rich in
resources and had a variety of structures, including irrigation systems, Hellenistic

towers and rural houses etc.212. These results refuted former arguments in historical
sources about the bareness of the territory213. The continuity of occupation of the
territory was also proved by the survey results which revealed production units
belonging to the Ottoman Period214. Moreover, a number of marble quarries were also
surveyed and the importance of this economic resource was mentioned in survey
reports as a fundamental source of income for the territory215.
The effective outcomes of this study indicate the importance of archeological surveys.
As mentioned by scholars, archeological surveys provide information about wider
areas and clarify the nature of the territorial organization of land and socio-economic
relations in a relatively much shorter time period than that of an archeological
excavation216. Excavations play a different role and cover specifically defined areas
and provide information in a longer-term process217.
The information provided by the Archeological Survey of the Gulf of Mandalya was
used to good account in new research regarding the conservation policies for both
Iasos and its territory by the survey team. They aimed at an interdisciplinary project
which focused on pedestrian routes to cover important heritage sites in the territory
(Figure 3.17). A visitor center providing all the historical, archeological, geological
and social information available about the territory was proposed in an old olive oil
plant located in the village of Kıyıkışlacık. The focus of the itineraries was the
Hellenistic fortification walls located on the mainland. The reason for this choice was
explained by Pierobon Benoit as the fact these fortifications covered settlements,
necropolis, significant edifices and natural formations both inside and outside the
study area. The proposals also emphasized the importance of participation by local
authorities and inhabitants in achieving the proper introduction of the heritage that the

territory acts as host to the public. The ultimate aim was the successful conservation
of the cultural heritage of the site218. However, this project was not implemented
because of lack of authorization from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.

Figure 3.17. Pedestrian routes (1-2) for the visit of remains (Pierobon Benoit, 2012,

Archeological finds are presented in the Museum of İzmir, the Museum of Milas and
the Museum of Balık Pazarı at Kıyıkışlacık. Not only Iasos but also assets from the
Akarca Collection are included in the latter museum. These territorial findings were
transferred from the Akarca Collection to the Museum of Balık Pazarı in 2011 and
2013.
As an overall view of the archeological studies, it can be said that the results and
findings of the excavations and field survey provide significant further information

218

Pierobon Benoit, 2012, p. 120.

107

about the territory and its socio-economic structure. For example, a necropolis
belonging to the Early Bronze Age as one of the earlier findings of excavations
indicates the cultural interaction between Western Anatolia and the Aegean islands by
similarities in burial method and structural typology219. This means that the ‘veil of
silence’ that obscured the history of the area due to lack of mention in the historical
sources was dispelled by the archeological findings. The territorial findings also
confirm the fertility of land which was once misinterpreted due to historical sources.
However, the most significant outcome of this study can be considered as the effort
towards conservation and presentation of the heritages at the site in the light of the
archeological survey findings.

Touristic Interest: Development of the Secondary Housing Zones
As mentioned above, the social and economic structure of the village has improved as
a consequence of the archeological investigations at Iasos. The Aegean coast has also
led to a growing interest in Kıyıkışlacık together with its archeological site. The results
of this growing interest could be seen towards the end of the 1970s on the peripheries
of the main settlement area. By analyzing the aerial photographs provided by the
General Directorate of Mapping, it can be seen that first secondary housing
development took place in between 1972 and 1975. By the end of the 1990s, the
peripheries started to be occupied by the large clusters of secondary housing (Figure
3.18).

3.3. Interventions: State Driven Policies, Plans and Projects
During the historical development of Kıyıkışlacık, governmental interventions played
a significant role in the development of the physical and socio-economic structure of
the village. Although the excavations started in 1960, the legal recognition of the site
only occurred in 1972 with the preparation of a cadastral plan220. However, it can be
assumed that governmental interest increased after the first archeological site
designation in 1977. Following the designation of the 1st and 3rd degree archeological
sites, a plan was prepared to regulate and control the physical development of village.
Despite this plan never being implemented, several designations of archeological sites,
conservation areas and buildings indicated the continuity of governmental interest on
Kıyıkışlacık. A detailed analysis of the conservation decisions and planning processes,
starting with the preparation of the development plan (imar planı) to a partial planning
(mevzi imar planı) process will be presented below.

The information given in this section has been provided by different local institutions:
The Milas Municipality (Milas Belediyesi), the Metropolitan Municipality of Muğla
(Muğla Büyükşehir Belediyesi) and the Muğla Regional Conservation Council of
Cultural Properties (Muğla Kültür Varlıklarını Koruma Bölge Kurulu)221. The
databases containing boundaries and written documents constituted the basic
resources for analyzing the state-driven interventions on the site. In the analysis of this
information, contradictions between databases and decision documents, as well as the
absence of some decisions can be seen. One of the main reasons for this were the
changes in the conservation council responsible222. Using a detailed comparison
between the different conservation boundaries and decisions, the following chart has
been compiled showing the information in chronological order. It should be
emphasized that there may be missing and/or no longer valid decisions due to the lack
of information provided by the institutions.

Site Boundaries and Designations
As mentioned above, the compilation of the decisions by different conservation
councils has been prepared by comparing information provided by different sources
and obtained from the local institutions: The Milas Municipality and the Metropolitan
Municipality of Muğla. The following chart gives detailed information about the
conservation council decisions in chronological order223.

Hereafter, the name of the council will be mentioned as the Conservation Council of Muğla.
The cultural property of Milas was under the responsibility of the Second Regional Conservation
Council of Natural and Cultural Properties of İzmir (İzmir 2.Bölge Kültür ve Tabiat Varlıklarını
Koruma Bölge Kurulu) until the 2000s. With the establishment of a separate council in Muğla, all the
documents were transferred. The officers note that considerable amount of documents were lost during
this process.

(Prepared by the author after the decisions provided by Muğla Regional
Conservation Council of the Cultural Properties)

The first archeological site designations at Iasos were made in 1977 and 1978.
Although the original documentation of these decisions was unobtainable, the
boundaries can be seen in the plan prepared in 1996. Accordingly, a 1st degree
archeological site, including the archeological remains of Iasos on the promontory and
a part of the mainland on the north of the isthmus and the coastal line of the opposite
side of the Little Harbor was designated by a GEEAYK decision no: A-277 dated
14.01.1977. Similarly, a large area on the mainland including, the Mainland Wall on
the west and the so-called Clock Tower on the east of the settlement, was designated
as a 3rd degree archeological site with decision no: A-1362 dated 14.10.1978.
Additionally, a conservation area concerning the Mainland Wall was shown as

112

“existing conservation boundaries” on the mentioned plan. It can be deduced that the
conservation area surrounding the Mainland Wall was designated at some time
between 1978 and 1996.
With the proposal of some conservation areas by the development plan in 1996, the
area surrounding the so-called Balık Pazarı, Clock Tower, prehistoric necropolis,
missing sections of the Mainland Wall and some archeological remains on the
opposite side of the Little Harbor were designated by the İzmir Conservation
Council224 with decision no: 6029 dated 11.09.1996.

Figure 3.20. Archeological site designations in the nearby surroundings of Iasos
The Second Regional Conservation Council of Natural and Cultural Properties of İzmir will be
mentioned as Conservation Council of İzmir hereafter.
224

113

Another change in the site boundaries took place in 2009 by decision no: 5324,
designating the area surrounding the so-called Clock Tower as the 1st grade
archeological site. The area, including an ancient water source and some archeological
remains, was also designated by the same decision, as 1st and 3rd grade archeological
sites. The site status of this area has later been changed to a 1st grade archeological
site by decision no: 6789 dated 23.05.2018.
Apart from the above mentioned conservation boundaries, there are several
archeological sites in the areas surrounding the study area. The Cario-Lelegean
building remains on the localities known as Zindafkale and Çanacık Tepe are some of
the most significant heritage sites in the region225. Similarly, other listed archeological
remains on the mainland, including the Roman necropolis of Iasos are also shown
below.

Planning Practices
Although the physical development of the village is not controlled by a spatial plan in
the current legislation, some planning practices were implemented in Kıyıkışlacık by
means of both a development plan (imar planı) and partial plans (mevzi imar planı).

1/5000 and 1/1000 Scale Development Plans
When the governmental decisions concerning the spatial development of Kıyıkışlacık
are analyzed, only one attempt can be observed. This includes planning concerns on
two different scales: the 1/5000 and 1/1000 development plans. The 1/5000 scale
development plan which includes the upper scale decisions was provided by the
Conservation Council of İzmir. As one of the most important decisions of this plan,
new conservation areas for different archeological remains are suggested, as

225

Pierobon Benoit, 2012, p. 5.

114

mentioned above. Another remarkable decision was the conservation of olive groves
on the western side of the rural settlement, which also aims at creating a natural buffer
zone between the Mainland Wall and the development of the rural settlement. On the
eastern side of the settlement, area of agricultural land were also protected to protect
the sustainability of agricultural production. In addition, a park was proposed on the
coast that was to be protected from spatial development.
Spatial development decisions were based on organizing the road traffic on the
northern periphery of village so as to create a main road connecting village with Milas.
New housing areas and commercial uses were planned on the existing north-western
axis road, which was intended to connect the settlement with a new ring road. Another
critical approach of the plan was the proposal for tourism areas on both the eastern
and western peripheries of the village. Large areas of land were assigned to
preferential land use (tercihli kullanım) and hotel areas, both of which serve
development of tourism activities (Figure 3.21).
The development plan was prepared by 1996, when it was submitted to the
Conservation Council of İzmir. Although some approaches were approved, the plan
as a whole was not approved by the council. In fact, serious changes were demanded
concerning structural regulations. The documents regarding the approval and/or stay
of execution226 could not be obtained from the local institutions as a result of the
archival problems. However, it was stated by the Conservation Council of Muğla, the
Metropolitan Municipality of Muğla and the Milas Municipality that the 1/5000 and
1/1000 Development Plans were cancelled and the village continued to develop
without a spatial plan. The only advantage of these plans was the declaration of five
new conservation areas, which have been detailed above.

226

Stay of execution here means the suspension of the development plan by a court decision.

115

Figure 3.21. 1/5000 Scale Development Plan of Kıyıkışlacık, 1996 (Conservation
Council of Muğla)

However, this incomplete process of spatial planning ended up by creating critical
problems which still persist. Due to the absence of a revision and/or a new spatialconservation plan regarding Kıyıkışlacık, the physical development of the settlement
continued beyond the control of the local authorities. In fact, this uncontrolled
development caused the emergence of a partial planning aimed at speeding up the
construction of touristic facilities and secondary housing.

Partial Development Plans
Partial development plans concern settlements whose existing spatial plans remain
inadequate due to population increase or the development of new areas outside the
existing plan boundaries. As mentioned above, the absence of a plan in Kıyıkışlacık

116

led to the development of tourism facilities and secondary housing areas, by partial
plans, surrounding Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık.
The secondary housing areas and touristic facilities on the eastern peripheries of the
village were constructed upon the basis of different partial plans approved in 2006,
2008, 2011 and 2012 respectively227. Concerning areas outside the archeological site
boundaries, these plans were not subject to the approval of the Conservation Council
of Muğla. However, significant archeological remains were unearthed during the
foundation excavations for secondary housing units.
Similarly, a secondary housing area on the western periphery was developed within
the context of partial plans made in 1987 and 2008. Although these partial plans should
have been approved by the Conservation Council of Muğla, the related decisions could
not be obtained by the author.

3.4. Evolution of the Macroform Throughout History
The effects of the historical process can be traced from the aerial photographs provided
by the General Directorate of Mapping. The earliest aerial photograph, taken in 1938,
goes significantly back into the past and is valuable in terms of spatial data. The traces
of the rural settlement located on the Roman Necropolis can be observed in this
photograph, together with a road which still serves as a main artery of the village. In
addition, the presence of cultivated areas is also an important indication of an active
agricultural community. In 1954, an increase in building activity can be observed
towards the western part of the mainland without, however, any significant degree of
sprawl. An increase in agricultural activities is visible on the peripheries of the
settlement.

227

Oral information provided by the staff of the Municipality of Milas.

117

A considerable extension of the settlement can be seen in the aerial photograph taken
in 1975. This provides the physical evidence of the socio-economic development of
the village. . The advent of three olive oil plants, a mosque, an increase in excavation
areas, and construction activities on the opposite side of the Little Harbor can all be
identified.
In 1992, the spread of the settlement reached its highest point with the construction of
secondary housing clusters in the western and eastern directions. Additionally,
housing areas of low density interposed with agricultural land can be seen on the
eastern periphery. In the following years, the density of these newly settled areas
increased. In 1998, a secondary housing cluster occupied a large area at the eastern
end of the settlement. Similarly, the density of buildings on the western periphery
increased. The same kind of spatial development characteristic can be seen in the
aerial photograph of 2012 on the eastern and western boundaries of the settlement.
As a result, until the end of the 1970s, the spatial evolution of Kıyıkışlacık indicated
the increasing rural development of the settlement, while after the 1990s, this
development only concerns the construction of summer houses on the peripheries as
a result of partial planning interventions. It can thus be concluded that the current
macroform of the settlement has mainly been shaped by the growing interest in
tourism.
The analysis of the historical development process of the site is crucial for
understanding the integration of the archeological site of Iasos and the rural settlement
of Kıyıkışlacık. Starting from the foundation of the ancient city of Iasos, the land has
been occupied by different functions. As a result, the present-day rural landscape is
shaped by the historical layering, composed of the archeological heritage of Iasos,
social and physical inheritance of the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık and the touristic
identity created by the secondary housing clusters and accommodation facilities.

118

Figure 3.22. Evolution of the macroform (HGM, reproduced by the author)

3.5. The Present-Day Built Environment
The historical process of the formation of Iasos and the overlapping rural settlement
has already been presented. In this section, the physical consequences on the site are
analyzed and presented as an outcome of the historical process. In line with the general
approach of this thesis, the physical structure of the site is presented in three
contextually different zones: the archeological site of Iasos, the rural settlement and
the territory as a whole (Figure 3.47). Information regarding the entire site is given at
the beginning, i.e. the current legislative boundaries and the ownership patterns.

119

Current Legislative Boundaries
The current conservation boundaries, identified through a detailed analysis of the
information provided by the local institutions, are shown in Figure 3.55 including the
study area.
Accordingly, the entire promontory and a large area covering the traditional core of
the village are located within the boundaries of 1st degree archeological site. Similarly,
the western section of the Mainland wall has also been taken under protection as a 1st
degree archeological site. Except for these areas, other areas of land within the study
area are located within the boundaries of the 3rd degree archeological site.
Additionally, the areas surrounding the so-called Clock Tower, Balık Pazarı Museum,
Mainland wall and an ancient water resource are designated as conservation areas228.

The Ownership Pattern
The first cadastral plan was prepared in 1972 according to the information given by
the Municipality of Milas and the local residents of Kıyıkışlacık. Due to the absence
of conservation designations and decisions, parceling included the archeological
remains on both promontory and mainland. The land had been subdivided and
apportioned to so-called owners according to the land use in 1972. Thus, archeological
vestiges became privately owned according to the diktats of the cadastral plan.
Although the ownership of some of these vestiges was later transferred to state
institutions by expropriation, there is still a large amount of archeological remains
under private ownership229.
When the current land ownership pattern is analyzed, four different ownership
categories can be identified: private (şahıs), a village legal entity (köy tüzel kişiliği),
state owned (hazine-maliye) and under Special Provincial Administration (İl Özel
228

For a detailed information on the site boundary decisions, see in this chapter, pp. 111-114.
Private ownership of the archeological property will be examined in detail at Chapter 4, pp. 187190.

İdaresi)230. In the case of Special Provincial Administration, it should be emphasized
that the given cadastral information is outdated due to the closure of these local entities
by the declaration of Law No: 6360. With the enactment of this act, lands owned by
Special Provincial Administration in the national interest are transferred to other local
institutions. However, the lands did not lose their public status by this process. Thus,
land ownership categories in Kıyıkışlacık can be classified into two groups as private
and public. As can be seen from Table 3.2, the majority of the land is privately owned
in a ratio of 77% and these plots are scattered across the study area. Areas owned by
the state are concentrated on the western side of the study area, where the wild olive
groves are located. Special Provincial Administration lands cover the road built on the
isthmus. Lastly, the village legal entity owns the small lots inside the village, as well
as the area occupied by the open air market. In addition, the pastures on the northern
section of the rural settlements are also owned by the village legal entity.

Figure 3.24. Archeological remains on the mainland (Tomasello, 1991, Figure 2)

As a part of the wider territory, Iasos is a small settlement, which was surrounded by
a necropolis, centered around an intense road network. The intra-urban and extraurban areas are defined as a peninsula and the mainland in Iasos’ case. While the
peninsula as seen today, which was once considered to be a promontory, had always
been occupied for urban activities, the mainland, defining the hinterland which
provided the economic and agricultural needs of the city, was occupied by the
necropolis since earlier periods231. The current physical environment of the Iasos
archeological site is presented with an examination of its contents.

Both the polis (intra-urbem area) and the chora (extra-urbem area) include remains of
defensive structures. The peninsula in particular has three fortification systems
constructed at different periods, while the mainland was also occupied by a massive
defensive structure.
City Walls
Small sections of the city walls which once surrounded the peninsula remain on the
south eastern part of the present day archeological site (Figure 3.23/1). Since the
masonry of this wall was progressively removed for reuse in in other buildings,
including the construction of a port in Istanbul in 1889, the integrity of this
fortification system has been lost232. However, the entirety of these walls can be seen
in Texier’s drawing of 1862 (Figure 3.5). This drawing depicts a wall that was 2 km
long following the line of the coast and reinforced by square towers. It was constructed
in isodomic ashlar masonry233. There were three main gates through the wall. These
were located on the northwest part of the isthmus opening to the agora, on the east
facing the Big Harbor and on the southernmost part of the promontory. Although the
dating of these fortification walls has long been debated due to the lack of solid
information, scholars have generally agreed on a 4th century BCE dating234.
As a part of the fortification system surrounding the peninsula, a tower was built on
the Little Harbor, at the southern most of the promontory (Figure 3.23/2 and Figure
3.25). This tower is connected to the fortifications on the acropolis by a pathway and
the tower was located on one of the two piers, closing the Little Harbor, which are
now submerged. These piers date back to Roman Imperial Period, and the square

tower is considered to have been built between the 10th and 11th centuries, i.e. in the
Byzantine period, for defensive purposes235.

Figure 3.25. Iasos, the Middle Byzantine Tower

The Castle on the Acropolis
Apart from the city walls, there are two other fortification systems on the peninsula.
One of these systems surrounds the Acropolis which was located on the highest point
of the peninsula (Figure 3.23/3 and Figure 3.26).The castle is considered to have been
built for military purposes236. Semicircular and square towers strengthening the
fortification can be seen on three sides except for the eastern side which has the natural
protection of the steep rocky topography. On this side, spolia can be seen on the lower
parts of the wall including drums from columns and pieces of a Doric frieze237. The
two gates provide entrance to the fortified area. The gate located on the north and
protected by two square towers is considered to be main entrance238. The remains of a
cistern belonging to the Byzantine period and a temple from the Hellenistic period can
be seen within the walls239.

Figure 3.26: Aerial view of the castle on the acropolis (Photo: Kayıhan Babacan)

The exact date of the construction of the castle on the Acropolis is debated by
scholars240. However, it is considered to be one of the latest architectural complexes
of Iasos, before the abandonment of the city, as shown in the findings of the 2011
excavations241. The castle is dated back to the 14th century, based on a akçe (coin),
known to belong the Menteşe Principality, found in one of the rooms located on the
western side of the court.
Fortifications on the Isthmus
The second fortification system is located on the isthmus (Figure 3.23/4). This
fortification is often called as the “castle of isthmus” and was investigated by a group
of researchers led by Alessandra Viscogliosi from 2008 to 2014, when the excavations
were stopped. This later wall joins the city walls on the east and the fortified area
240

Levi (1986, p. 20) attributes this castle to the 12th-13th centuries, and Serin (2004, p. 17) and Berti
(1993, p. 127) note that it belongs to Middle Byzantine Period.

occupies the northeastern part of the agora. As the archeological survey indicates, the
remains of a large bath and other undefined structures indicate a considerable urban
development in this fortified area242. This area was inhabited during the mid-imperial
and post-Roman periods according to the findings of the archeological survey243.
However, layers belonging to post-antique phases as well as the 13th and 14th centuries
were discovered in 2011 by the excavation team244. Since no excavation has been
carried out in the fortifications on the isthmus, a detailed archeological investigation
is needed for further research on dating and function of this fortified area.
The Mainland Wall
As a massive and impressive defensive structure, occupying an area on the plain to
the northwest of the isthmus, the mainland wall surrounds the northern hill of the Little
Harbor and extends for 2.5 km (Figure 3.24/1)245. Doro Levi claims that these walls
started from the sea, near the Little Harbor246. Although the function of this mainland
wall has long been debated, scholars generally agree that the wall was constructed for
the protection of the Gulf and regional trade routes rather than encircling a settlement
area247. Findings of the archeological survey carried out on the mainland indicate that
the wall was incomplete due to plundering, and the absence of any urban activity
within the area enclosed by this wall248. The burials which were located near the
entrances through the wall are considered to be clear evidence for such a hypothesis.
The construction technique is defined by Berti as a technique which employs
precautions against assault by external enemies249. The walls were constructed with
trapezoidal isodomic masonry using schist blocks quarried locally250. Semicircular
towers, gates, windows, and stairs are considered to indicate the quality of the

construction and to provide unique examples when compared to the walls surrounding
the peninsula251.
The dating of the wall has also been subject to discussion and remains uncertain due
to the lack of historical information252. However, Pierobon Benoit develops a
hypothesis which links the construction of the mainland wall to the 3rd century BCE,
stemming from a detailed analysis of the materials of the structure253.

The Intra-urbem Area (Polis)
The term intra-urbem (intra urban) refers to the area, i.e. the polis, located on the
promontory which was once separated from the mainland by a narrow channel and is
surrounded by the Hellenistic fortifications (Figure 3.23). As with the excavated and
unexplored remains of the continuously settled city, the rocky peninsula contains the
physical evidence of different historical layers; with the Early Bronze Age, Late
Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods, being among the most visible
archeological layers as evidenced by the traces belonging to these periods254.
However, there are still a number of structures awaiting further archeological
investigation.
The peninsula is dominated by a steep and rocky hill, the presence of which affected
the development of the ancient city with the steepness of the terrain preventing
building activities on the western slopes of the peninsula facing the Little Harbor. The
northeastern and southernmost part of the peninsula as far as the seashore as well as
the terraced eastern slopes, on the other hand, were suitable for building activity, as
can be seen from the remains of residential units located on these eastern slopes
(Figure 3.23/15).

The Northern Section of the Peninsula: Agora
The northern section of the promontory is the best preserved area of the archeological
site and occupied by the agora and public buildings (Figure 3.23/5). The current
entrance to the peninsula lies in this northern section of the promontory via one of the
gates in the surrounding city walls. Since this section of the peninsula had been
actively and densely occupied since the Early Bronze Age, the earliest archeological
investigations of Iasos were concentrated on this area255. Even today, the presence of
historical layers starting from the Early Bronze Age to the Late Byzantine Period are
visible in the northern section of the promontory (Figure 3.27).

Figure 3.27. Iasos, panoramic view of the agora

The earliest archeological findings from promontory, i.e. regarding the necropolis
belonging to the Geometric Period, and structures from the Bronze Age, came from
this area256. From the 4th century BCE onwards, small religious buildings were
constructed in this area. However, the function of the area had changed to a public
square in 4th century BCE, with the occupation of Hellenistic and Roman agora257.
The agora was destroyed in the 5th century CE, and a three-aisled basilica was
constructed in the central area in the 6th century (Figure 3.23/6)258. Since some sections

were removed during the excavations in the 1960s, which aimed to reveal the layers
belong to Early Bronze Age, the southern narthex cannot be seen today259.
There are several buildings around agora which indicate the public function of the
northern section of city. The southern stoa gives access to a group of public buildings,
and terminates in the caesareum. As one of the public buildings located on the west of
the south stoa, the bouleuterion is one of the best preserved surviving structures of the
city (Figure 3.23/7 and Figure 3.28) 260. Although an earlier building dated back to the
4th century BCE was located in this section, the present building dates to the 1st century
CE261. The sanctuary of Artemis Astias is located on the east of the bouleuterion, as a
significant structure showing different archeological layers (Figure 3.23/8). From the
archaic period onwards, this area was defined as a sacred and most of the important
inscriptions were found in this area262.

The East Gate and Its Surroundings
There is access from the agora to a flat area on the northeast side of the peninsula. The
remains of several buildings are visible today, probably because this section of the
promontory was more suitable for building activities. In addition, one of the main
entrances through the city walls surrounding the peninsula is located in this section of
the promontory, i.e. the East Gate.
The Sanctuary of Zeus Megistos, as the most important religious building of Iasos, is
one of the buildings located in the flat northern area (Figure 3.23/9)263. A large number
of inscriptions were found in the thesauros, which is the remaining part of the
sanctuary, and provide significant information about city’s religious history264.
On the southeast of the sanctuary, the remains of a building complex can be seen
(Figure 3.23/10). This building complex is formed by rooms floored with mosaics
around a peristyle with a fountain265. The remains of a Doric order courtyard has led
scholars to date the building to the Late Hellenistic Period266. Although certain
alterations have been identified, detailed archeological excavations are needed to
reveal the original function of this building complex267.
The remains of three churches are also visible in this section of the promontory. One
of these churches is located outside the city walls, facing the Big Harbor (Figure
3.23/11a). The other two churches, which are located inside the city walls, have not
been excavated, and only traces of remains can be observed at present. These are
located to the south of the building complex mentioned above, and adjacent to the city
wall to the east of the Eastern Gate (Figure 3.23/11b-c-d).

The Eastern and Southern Slopes and the Theater
The theater of Iasos, which is situated on the northeastern slopes of the peninsula
below the castle on the acropolis, is considered to be one of the most significant
landmarks of the city (Figure 3.23/12)268. A festival dedicated to Dionysus took place
in this theater and was instrumental in making Iasos a musical and dramatic center in
the region269. The theater can be seen in a drawing by Texier of 1849, when the
building was still intact, before the removal of its architectural elements (Figure 3.29).
As mentioned earlier, the seats and marble pieces of its walls had been carried away
in 1887 to be used as construction material in the port structures in İstanbul270. At
present, its curvilinear layout on the slope can be seen; with the remains of the
analemma wall.

Figure 3.30. Iasos, the theatre, present situation

The remains on the eastern slopes of the promontory, i.e. the southeast side of the
theatre together with the southern slopes of the promontory, are of residential
buildings271. Since the geographical formation of the peninsula was conducive to
building on these sides, both the natural or artificial terraces encouraged intense
building activities.
One of these residential quarters can be seen on the eastern slopes, through the
artificial terraces to the southeast of theater (Figure 3.23/13 and Figure 3.31). The
residential insulae are divided by a paved street under which a sewage system was
revealed during excavations272. The residential units on this side were built with
pseudo-isodomic masonry and alterations in the layout and materials indicates later
interventions273. On the western end of the paved street, a mosaic floor can be seen in
one of the units.
The residential quarter on the southern slopes differs from the eastern neighborhood
in the formation of the land and the buildings on it. On this side of the hill, with a
panoramic view towards the Gulf of Mandalya, the natural terraces are occupied by a
residential building known as the House of Mosaics (Figure 3.23/14). This building is

dated to the 2nd century CE and named after its impressive mosaic floors274. The walls
were decorated with frescoes which can still be seen today. Other buildings on the
southern slopes are occupied by additional residential buildings with mosaics and a
residential complex together with a cistern can still be seen today (Figure 3.23/15 and
Figure 3.36).

The southern end of the promontory is occupied by the Sanctuary of Demeter and
Kore, which is dated to the second half of the 6th century BCE (Figure 3.23/16)275, and
comprises one of the earliest structures at Iasos276. As with the Sanctuary of Zeus
Megistos, large amounts of sculpture were unearthed during the excavations277.

The Extra-urbem Area (Chora)
The term extra-urbem refers to the area outside the walls and encompasses the chora
of Iasos on the mainland. While urban life was enhanced by public buildings and
residential quarters on the peninsula inside the city walls, the mainland was occupied
by the necropolis and other extra urban structures. The mainland shows continuous
use as a necropolis from the Early Bronze Age through to the Hellenistic period 278.
Starting from the north of the isthmus, the flat terrain shows numerous remains of this
necropolis complex.
Necropolis and the Tombs
The earliest remains were discovered on the north of the isthmus by an excavation
carried out in the 1960s (Figure 3.24/2)279. This area was identified as an Early Bronze
Age necropolis and the findings were transferred to the Museum of İzmir280. However,
the area was neglected after the removal of the finds and today it remains as empty
scrub land covered by thick vegetation (Figure 3.33).

Figure 3.33. The Prehistoric necropolis, present situation

In addition to this, the only excavated necropolis, some tombs belonging to the Late
Geometric period and burial remains from the Hellenistic and Roman Imperial periods
survive on the mainland281. The two significant monumental tombs differ from the
other remnants of the necropolis in terms of their impressive structures. These tombs,
along with other structures, are located near the entrance to the city on a pathway
following the coastline. The Roman Mausoleum known as the “Balık Pazarı”
comprises one of these two monumental tombs (Figure 3.24/3) and was described by
Berti as “the most magnificent tomb of Iasos”282. This mausoleum dates back to the
2nd century BCE, and is arranged around a peristyle, at the center of which a Corinthian
temple stands (Figure 3.34)283. The main entrance to the building lies on the east and
a burial chamber was discovered on the west. After the restoration work that was
carried out in 1995, the building was given a new function and now it is used as an
antiquarium, where the archeological finds from Iasos are displayed. The early
travelers who visited Iasos identified the building as ‘the fish market, i.e. Balık Pazarı,
after the legend that Strabo relates284. However, it appears to be a mausoleum showing
a Syrian influence, in the light of the excavation and restoration studies done in recent

times285. The building also abuts a section of the aqueduct that once carried the water
from the north of the island.
Another monumental tomb dated to the 2nd century CE, which is known as the “Clock
Tower” is situated 1 km from the city, on the left side of the road to Milas (Figure
3.24/4)286. By virtue of its location and height, the tomb, located at the entrance of the
city, has become a landmark. The two storey building has the burial room on the first
floor which functioned as a religious ceremonial space , with three sides open to the
outside (Figure 3.38)287. The front side with the entrance has not survived. This section
of the building is thought to have included the statute of the deceased288. The
restoration work on this structure was carried out in 1997 by the cooperation of the
Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Associazione Iassos di Caria.

Although it is difficult to get an overall understanding of the area in its entirety, this
monumental tomb appears to be part of a larger necropolis, with a whole group of
tombs surrounding the Clock Tower289. However, only a small and modest section of
these surrounding tombs can be seen today. The tomb situated next to the Clock Tower
with two rooms and an arch at the south is in a ruinous state at the present time (Figure
3.24/5).
Along with these monumental tombs, there are numerous chamber tombs from the
Roman Period that are known to have once existed on the mainland290. These chamber
tombs are concentrated on the west of the mainland facing the Little Harbor, while the
southernmost point has few remains (Figure 3.24/6). Except for the monumental
tombs situated along the main road of the village, the chamber tombs have usually
been surrounded with new constructions since the foundation of the village of
Kıyıkışlacık in the 1920s. While some of these chamber tombs have been used by
local people as out buildings, a considerable portion of these structures have not been
used and, are now in ruins291.
Other Remains on the Mainland
Although the mainland has been occupied by the necropolis since prehistoric periods,
it was a part of the wider Iasos chora, where economic and religious activities took
place. For instance, the remains of walls on the eastern side of the Roman Mausoleum
belong to the largest church of Iasos, which is a three isled basilica (Figure 3.24/7 and
Figure 3.35)292.
The remains of Cario-Lelegean buildings and agricultural structures proves the
prevalence of economic activities based on agriculture293. As well as being the site of

By Guidi’s (1921, p. 352) descriptions, the structural condition and the integrity of the surrounding
tombs were in a better situation at those times.

an extensive necropolis, the plain on the mainland had supported the area with
economic activities and the supply of goods294. The mainland was able to provide
economic resources because of its fertile agricultural land and its ability to act as a
fresh water source for the peninsula. The water was supplied to the city by an aqueduct
on the mainland and reached to the channel once separating the peninsula from the
mainland, i.e. the current isthmus. Today, the remaining parts of this aqueduct can be
seen on the north of the isthmus (Figure 3.24/8 and Figure 3.35)295. These remains
reveal the traces of the route of the aqueduct, starting from the plain on the north and
reaching to the harbor and the promontory by following a northwest to southeast
direction296. One distinct section of this system can be seen within and around the
Roman Mausoleum (the so-called Balık Pazarı), which involves a part of the aqueduct
adjacent to its wall.

Figure 3.35. Mainland, the remains of an aqueduct (left) and the three aisled basilica

The hinterland surrounding the mainland plain of Iasos shows numerous traces of
ancient rural settlements, as indicated by the archeological field survey results. The

139

terraced lands, agricultural structures and rural building remains provide substantial
indicators of the existence of these rural settlements297. For instance, the remains of
Lelegean structures are concentrated around the mainland walls. Domes and spiral
staircases inside the building are the main characteristics of these circular Lelegean
buildings. These are attributed to the 4th century CE298. Among these rural sites,
Zindafkale is distinguishable by its remains, which was considered to be built for the
protection of a sanctuary area299.
In conclusion, with its fairly well conserved remains and substantial hinterland, Iasos
stands on one side of the Gulf of Mandalya. Several sites with remains on both the
peninsula and mainland await further and detailed archeological research. Especially
on the mainland where the modern village of Kıyıkışlacık is located, these sites have
significant value and potentials in terms of regional heritage which have not been
studied so far. For instance, the ashlar stone walls surrounding a large flat area on the
northwest section of village indicates the presence of a monumental structure which
is thought to have functioned as a sanctuary area (Figure 3.24/9)300. These remains
stand as substantial indicators of local and regional historical development in contrast
with the silence of historical resources. Although these remaining buildings have great
potential in terms of unexcavated potential, the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık located
on the mainland and new developments of summer houses on the peripheries threaten
their existence. Even so, the indigenous relationship between this rural settlement and
the remains from the time of the foundation of the village of Kıyıkışlacık has had a
positive effect in terms of the conservation of cultural heritage. In the following
chapters, the effects of this foundation and continuity of the village on the
archeological heritage will be examined through the characteristics of the present-day
built environment, socio-economic structure and legal processes that the site had to
face.

The Village of Kıyıkışlacık
The rural built environment of the village of Kıyıkışlacık sits currently at the center
of the area on the mainland continuously settled since the 1920s when the first village
of Asin Kurin was founded. The physical environment of the rural settlement consists
of two components: built up and open areas. In fact, the integration of these two
components defines the rural characteristic of the site. The built environment is
bordered by agricultural land on the western, northern and eastern peripheries and
includes mainly olive groves. To the south, a direct relationship with the sea defines
the rural tissue. The organic tissue of the rural settlement can be observed in the
following figure. The organization of the building lots, in terms of the balance between
open and built-up areas differentiates this part of the settlement from the new
development areas on the peripheries.

Open Areas
The open areas in the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık are used as courtyards for public
and private buildings, residential gardens, parks, streets and car parking areas,
cultivated areas, and olive groves. There are also open areas which are not in use
and/or rocky hills. In order to understand the use pattern, the open areas are grouped
under two main headings: public open areas and private open areas.
Private open areas consist of the courtyards and gardens of the privately owned
buildings and agricultural land. Residential courtyards are defined by main buildings
and outbuildings, used as coops, barns or storage in most cases. In some cases, small
gardens on the private lots also define the courtyards and offer direct access. Apart
from these small gardens, fruit and olive trees also grow in some courtyards. As a
result, the courtyards are active living spaces of the residential lots with daily activities
and small scale agricultural production.

141

The streets and car parking areas, a park, and the courtyards of the public buildings
are categorized as public open areas. One of the most commonly used public open
area is the recreational land on the coast facing the Little Harbor. Especially in the
summer season, the public use of this coastal recreational area has become intense
with the increasing tourist population.

Most of the streets are paved with concrete paving blocks, although the main arteries
towards Milas and Zeytinlikuyu are paved with asphalt. There are also unpaved (dirt
tracks) roads especially in the peripheral areas. All the streets in the village are open
to vehicle traffic, but not all the streets are passable by vehicles due to their width. The
presence of cul-de-sacs is remarkable and can be considered as a local characteristic
of the rural settlement. There are also pedestrian routes (alleyways) in the inner section
of the settlement, which have been naturally formed by the needs of daily life instead
of being part of a cadastral plan.
There is only one park in the entire village which is neglected and disused. There are
no specifically planned squares in terms of street elements and function. However,
some nodes have been created through the daily life of the village. A large number of
these nodes are related to the coastal strip.

Figure 3.38. Kıyıkışlacık, examples of the pedestrian routes inside the village

The open areas including the archeological conservation sites can also be identified as
disused due to the lack of scientific studies and public presentation. The prehistoric
necropolis is among these examples where no archeological investigation have been
carried out recently. However, the courtyard of the so-called Balık Pazarı is naturally
open to public as a result of its use as a local museum, where archeological finds from
Iasos are on display.

Built-Up Areas

Building Categories
The built-up environment of Kıyıkışlacık has been formed by the existence of different
types of buildings, which can mainly be grouped as traditional buildings, new
buildings and archeological remains. The traditional buildings include residential
buildings, olive oil plants, a mosque and a school. The new buildings include
residential, commercial (or both at the same time) and public buildings. The small
chamber tombs, as well as the monumental ones, such as the so-called Balık Pazarı,
and an aqueduct are the buildings that can be defined as archeological remains. The
spatial and numerical distribution of building categories can be seen in the following
table and Figure 3.59.

Traditional Buildings
The traditional residential buildings of the rural settlement date back to the earlier
phases of the rural settlement of Asin Kurin. Since these buildings are small in
number, a typology cannot be provided. The surviving houses have been abandoned
and in a state of ruin. Nevertheless, some similarities with the surrounding settlements
in the region can be identified. In fact, the traditional houses of Kıyıkışlacık reflect the
local building techniques and materials that can be seen elsewhere in the region of
Muğla.

145

The traditional houses are distinguishable by their form and materials. The houses are
built with regular rubble stones, obtained from local quarries, as well as spolia. The
roofs are flat and covered with beaten earth. From the remaining examples, it can be
said that houses are either single storey (Yer Ev) or elevated from the ground (Hanay)
with a space underneath used mostly as storage301. The plan typology of these single
space houses are rectangular or square. One of the most distinctive characteristics of
the traditional houses are the fire places (ocak) projecting from the external façade on
which they are located. In fact, the houses that received alterations in later periods can
be identified by their ocak (Figure 3.41). This is normally located on the side façade,
near which the activities of daily life, such as cooking and heating, took place302.
There are three olive oil plants in the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık, which date back
to the 1970s. In fact, the aerial photographs of 1972 and 1975 show the establishment
process of these production units (Figure 3.42). As with the traditional residential
buildings, the olive oil plants were built with rubble stone masonry. In the plan
organization, there is a main building surrounded by the square-shaped units in the
courtyard. These units are called dökek, in which the extraction of the olive oil took
place. One of the current olive oil plants has some remaining parts of these units
(Figure 3.43), while in the other two buildings, these units have been destroyed (Figure
3.44). According to the information provided by local residents, the production in
these olive oil plants has been discontinued since the beginning of the 2000s,
something observable in the aerial photograph of 1998303. Thus, the structural
condition of these buildings is now threatened by lack of use and maintenance. The
one located at the entrance to the archeological site has partially collapsed.

301

Although the local terminology of the region is presented in this study, this could not be obtained
from the local residents of Kıyıkışlacık because of the absence of the owners of the old houses.
According to a study on traditional houses of the region, the surviving ones in the current built
environment reflect the characteristics of Yer Ev and Hanay noted by Kurtuluş (2018, pp. 266-286) as
being directly built on the ground with a single space, or elevated above the ground with a space
underneath used as storage.

148

Together with the olive oil plants, a school and a mosque were also built in the
1970s304. The mosque is located near the isthmus, at the entrance of the coast line.
Although the mosque is rendered, the thickness of the walls indicates that it was built
with masonry. The school is relatively small and serves for both elementary and
secondary education in the rural settlement. Due to the organization of its plan, the
entrances of the class rooms are in the external wall of the building.
New Buildings
New buildings form the vast majority of the built-up environment of the present-day
rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık. These are mainly built with reinforced concrete, and
used as residential, commercial and public buildings, such as a medical center, and an
administrative center (muhtarlık). The new buildings also include the outbuildings of
the residential units, which are generally built with brick and briquette masonry.
Archeological Remains
As mentioned earlier, the mainland includes the remains of the Roman necropolis of
the ancient city of Iasos. Thus, archeological remains constitute the third building
category including the chamber tombs and an aqueduct. There are two monumental
chamber tombs inside the rural settlement: the so-called Balık Pazarı and the
Macedonian. The former is a Roman mausoleum which is currently used as a local
museum exhibiting the archeological finds from the ancient city of Iasos305. The other
monumental chamber tomb has been restored and is currently used as the kitchen of
the excavation center. Other chamber tombs on the mainland are relatively smaller
than the monumental ones, and have single space with rectangular plan form. In the
construction of these chamber tombs, opus caementicium was used306. The original
forms can be seen in the drawings Texier made, when he visited the site in the 19th
century (Figure 3.9). Although the roofs are described by scholars as either flat or

gabled, the majority of the remaining chamber tombs have flat roofs covered with
earth. In addition, a vaulted structure is visible in most of the chamber tombs from the
inside307. Another distinguishable characteristic of the chamber tombs is the large
dressed stones at the entrance. In present-day rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık, there
are 19 chamber tombs which are either in use or disused. These chamber tombs are
presented in Figure 4.18 at the end of this Chapter308.

Figure 3.46. Remains of the aqueduct

Current Function and Use of the Buildings
The current functions of the buildings provide as with detailed information about the
land use of the settlement. The functional characteristics reflect the physical and socioeconomic development of Kıyıkışlacık by indicating the current demands, tendencies
and inadequacies of daily life at the settlement.
As indicated by the present land use, a large area of land is occupied by residential
buildings and outbuildings such as barns, garages, coops and storage facilities. The
function of the residential units differs at the peripheries of the settlement due to
seasonal use. Commercial activities and public services, such as the medical center

307

Information about the present use of chamber tombs will be given in Chapter 4, p. 176.

150

and mosque are concentrated on the main artery extending to the coast from Milas. A
weekly bazaar (open air market) is also held on this artery. The commercial facilities
serve on a local scale for the daily needs of the local community and tourists in summer
season, such as grocery, fish market, barbershop, and kahvehane etc .309. The notable
number of the estate agencies in this area can be related to the development of second,
or holiday homes. Similarly, a limited number of hotels and pensions in the village are
also located on the sea front, facing the archeological site of Iasos. Thus it seems that
the coastal area of the village has become the most attractive and lively area of the
settlement.
The effects of the archeological site and excavations can be observed in the functional
nature of the rural settlement. The excavation House and the Balık Pazarı Museum, as
well as the pensions and a hotel indicate the notable influence of the archeological
heritage site on the village of Kıyıkışlacık.
Regarding education in the village, there is one school serving as both elementary and
primary school for the children of the village. The old school building was abandoned
with the construction of a new school building at the northern end of the settlement.
The analysis of the current building uses is aimed at understanding the dynamics of
the secondary housing development, as well as its impact on the rural settlement and
the occupancy of traditional buildings. Seasonal use is the reason for one third of the
new buildings. Yet, there are only three holiday homes within the rural settlement
itself. The current use of traditional buildings on the other hand, provides significant
information about the tendencies influencing the built environment of Kıyıkışlacık. In
fact, the majority of the traditional buildings are abandoned and lain unused for a long
period of time310.

309

Kahvehane is a local term used for coffee house where social interaction takes place (game playing,
community meetings, local elections etc.).
310
The physical appearance and structural condition of the traditional houses as well as the information
provided by local residents indicate that the houses were abandoned many years ago. The local people
also note that after the death of the owners, their heirs left houses and moved to new buildings.

151

Structural Condition
In the analysis of the structural condition of the buildings, five groups can be
identified. The identification of these groups is based on the structural evaluation of
the main structural system and construction materials. The first group refers to both
structural system and materials being in a good state. The second group consists of a
sound structural system with signs of material deterioration. The third group includes
buildings with structural problems and serious material deterioration. The fourth
group indicates partially or totally collapsed buildings. Lastly, the fifth group includes
the buildings which are still under construction.
As shown in the Figure 3.61, the majority of the new buildings are in a good state in
terms of structural condition. However, the situation concerning traditional buildings
is different. Although most of the traditional buildings analyzed have a sound
structural system, with a certain degree of material deterioration, 43% of these are
partially or totally collapsed, or have serious structural problems.

Number of Storeys
The analysis of the number of storeys is an indicator of the rural characteristic of the
settlement. In fact, the houses at Kıyıkışlacık are a maximum of three storeys high.
One and two storey buildings constitute the majority; most of the traditional buildings
are single storey, while the majority of the new buildings are two storeys high. The
three storey buildings are concentrated on the main artery of the village and on the
coastline (Figure 3.62). Although the reason for such a development can be the
emergence of a commercial center in the village, a concentration can also be observed
at the peripheries. Still, the rural characteristic of Kıyıkışlacık can be seen in terms of
the height of the buildings.

152

Territory
The groups of secondary housing clusters and areas including unfinished constructions
form the territory of the built environment of the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık.
Located in the surrounding agricultural land, the character of the territory of the village
is considered to be substantially different than the inhabited rural center. These
differences include the organization of open and built areas in clusters and of densities
and patterns. The different sections of the territory are shown in the following figure.

Figure 3.47. Zones according to the components of the territory

153

The direct physical relationship can be observed in Section 3-1, which is the oldest
secondary housing cluster in the territory311. This is located on the western periphery
of the village, close to the Mainland wall and along the main artery connecting the
village to Zeytinlikuyu. There are 35 houses in this housing complex, which all share
the same organizational plan. The buildings have two storeys and private gardens. The
boundaries of the housing area are defined by olive groves.

Figure 3.48. General view of the secondary housing units to the west of the village

Another secondary housing group is located on the eastern periphery of the village.
This Section 3-2 occupies a relatively small area of land. The housing units share
common open spaces rather than having private gardens. Although the construction
activity was only completed recently, it was started between the years 1972-1975. In
the present settlement pattern, this area is located on the development area of the
village.

311

This information has been gathered through a comparison of the aerial photographs from different
years, provided by the General Directorate of Mapping: See in this chapter, p. 108.

154

Figure 3.49. Secondary housing group in the eastern peripheries of the village, aerial
view (left); and general view (right)

The area containing five tourist facilities (pensions and hotels) within the secondary
housing area to the west of Section 3-1 is identified as the third section of the territory.
One of the main distinctive features of this section is the individual development of
the secondary housing units. In fact, a scattered pattern of development rather than a
cluster typed development is dominant in this section. Although the buildings have
two storeys, similarly to those in Section 3-1, some buildings are used as condos.
Being located to the west of the Little Harbor, the houses define the silhouette of the
coastline.

Figure 3.50. Residential buildings on the west of the Little Harbor

155

Section 3-4 includes the unfinished construction of a social facility for a public
institution to the west of the Little Harbor. After a legal injunction was passed halting
work on this project, the gigantic shell of this construction site has a negative and
disturbing visual effect on the landscape of Iasos, besides having occupied a potential
archeological site for more than 25 years.

Figure 3.51. Unfinished constructions on the west of the Little Harbor, aerial view
(left); and a seen from Iasos (right)

Similar to Section 3-4, a sizeable area (nearly 25 hectares) at the east end of the
settlement is occupied by a serious construction of a secondary housing cluster and
tourist facilities. Construction activities on this part of the territory have also been
stopped by a legal injunction. Although no information was provided by local
institutions, local residents reported that some significant archeological remains were
encountered during the construction processes. Such an information may be supported
by the archeological site designations and survey findings around the construction
areas.

ASSESSMENT OF VALUES, THREATS AND POTENTIALS CONCERNING
IASOS-KIYIKIŞLACIK

In an attempt to understand the organic integration of rural settlements with
archeological sites, a detailed analysis of the historical periods and physical structure
in the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık has been presented in the previous chapter. The
present chapter focuses on the evaluation of the coexistence of Iasos and Kıyıkışlacık
by identifying the values and threats together with the potentials to develop strategies
for the integrated conservation of this coexistence.
The conservation of cultural heritage depends on the assessment of their values312. In
fact, value assessment, as a method of identifying cultural significance, also provides
a framework for the conservation of cultural heritage313. Cultural significance was
defined in the revised version of the Burra Charter in 2013 as “aesthetic, historic,
scientific, social or spiritual value for the past, present or future generations”, and
policy making process in related with the understanding of the cultural significance314.
Thus, value assessment stands as a crucial issue in the conservation of cultural
heritage. However, the value assessment process has long been debated due its
subjectivity and variability. The methods used in assessing values are developing and
changing with regard to the classification of values, and this classification process is
considered to be subjective, and relative to time, society and place315. Since the
beginning of the 20th century, different value typologies have been identified by

Torre and Mason (2002, p. 3) note that: “Value has always been the reason underlying heritage
conservation. It is self-evident that no society makes an effort to conserve what it does not have value.”

different scholars and organizations316. As a result of such an ever changing spectrum
of the definition of values in cultural heritage, some conflicts and exclusions due to
generalization may occur in the categorization of values. Thus, the value assessment
approaches to cultural heritage conservation are re-considered in the identification of
values, in conjunction with rural landscape character assessment approaches. In this
manner, the value definitions and categorization of Feilden and Jokilehto are taken as
a basis, because of their approach to classifying cultural values in relation to the
interrelations between cultural heritage and present day observers317.
As previously mentioned, the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık is considered as an
integral part of the rural setting in which the archeological site of Iasos is located. The
significance of the setting of a cultural heritage structure is emphasized by Article 2
of the Xi’an Declaration, which was published by ICOMOS in 2005, as: Heritage
structures, sites or areas of various scales, including individual buildings or designed
spaces, historic cities or urban landscapes, landscapes, seascapes, cultural routes and
archaeological sites, … also derive their significance and distinctive character from
their meaningful relationships with their physical, visual, spiritual and other cultural
context and settings318. Since the remains of the ancient city of Iasos have become a
prominent component of the rural identity of Kıyıkışlacık, the assessment process, in
this case, needs to approach the integration via the specific relationship between the
archeological site and the rural settlement rather than simply identifying the values
and threats regarding archeological heritage. Using such an approach, the evaluation
phase of this study aims to assess values in terms of the major components of rural
settlements which are commonly used in rural landscape character analysis studies319,

316

Alois Riegl was first to define values in 1902. He is followed by William D. Lipe (1984), Henry
Cleere (1986), Bruno S. Frey and Werner W. Pommerehne (1989), Bernard M. Feilden and Jukka
Jokilehto (1998), Randall Mason (2002), David Throsby (2012), and others. For definitions of values
see English Heritage (1997); and ICOMOS (1998). For some different values defined by these scholars
and organizations, see also Özçakır, 2018, p.87, Table 3.
317
Feilden and Jokilehto, 1998, p. 18.

and match the site-specific values with the definitions of Feilden and Jokilehto (1998),
as noted in Management Guidelines for the World Cultural Heritage Sites320.


Nature: the natural components



Human: the socio-cultural components



Built-environment: the man-made components321

Together with the values, threats are also identified from the same perspective so that
both values and threats are assessed with regard to the groups covering natural
components, socio-cultural components and man-made components. In addition,
potentials are also identified within the context of an overall evaluation of values and
threats (Table 4.1).

320

Feilden and Jokilehto, 1998, pp. 18-21.
The values regarding the natural components cannot be classified according to the value definitions
on cultural heritage. Thus, these values are defined specifically. However, socio-cultural and man-made
components are evaluated within the scope of the cultural values and contemporary socio-economic
values, which are identified by Feilden and Jokilehto (1998).

Table 4.1. Values and Threats

4.1. Values
Values regarding the natural components
V1. Fertility of the land: The fertility of the mainland plain, on which the presentday rural settlement is located, is one of the major reasons for the area being inhabited
for so long. Although the earlier sources note the mainland as rendered infertile by its
poor soil, the land has been cultivated since the Archaic period as the archeological
surveys have revealed322. Nowadays, the main economic activity in the rural
settlement is the cultivation of olive trees in the surrounding agricultural land, making
the fertile land the main interaction area between humans and nature as one of the
major components of rural identity.
As mentioned earlier, olives are the main agricultural product of the rural landscape
where Kıyıkışlacık is located. In addition to the large areas of land on the periphery
of the settlement, olive groves cover the entire topography, including the promontory.
Since olive and olive oil production is now considered as a significant intangible
heritage323, the landscape surrounding Kıyıkışlacık is valuable as a reflection of the
culture of olive production.
V2. Coastal location: The coastal location of Kıyıkışlacık was one of the main criteria
for the choice of location for the ancient settlement in the first place324. The reasons
behind this were twofold: the strategic location facing the Gulf of Mandalya and being
resource-rich in terms of fishing. Strabo recounts a story about Iasos to emphasize the
richness of the fishery in terms of food and economic value325 and fishing remains one
of the main economic activities of the local community of Kıyıkışlacık.

322

Pierobon Benoit, 2012, p. 118.
Olive groves and production culture have been on UNESCO’s agenda since the beginning of 2010s.
There are significant olive groves that are either on the World Heritage List or Tentative List. The
Ayvalık Industrial Landscape of Turkey is also on the tentative list with its olive-groves. In addition,
the application process of registering the olive and olive oil production culture of the Mediterrenean
Region with UNESCO as an intangible world heritage was carried out by the Ministry of Culture and
Tourism in 2017 (URL 24; URL 25).

Figure 4.1. Fishing port of Kıyıkışlacık

Values regarding the socio-cultural components
V3. Active rural life326: One of the most important values of the integration of Iasos
and Kıyıkışlacık is the existence of an active rural lifestyle in the village. The state of
being “active” refers to the interaction between humans and nature as the essential
feature of rurality. The majority of the local community living in the village interact
with nature either through agriculture or fishing. Besides, there is a strong social
interaction between the local people in the form of cooperation. The local community
gathers in public places such as the kahvehane (coffee-shop) and mosque. There is, in
addition, an association focused on the development of tourism and the conservation
of nature, namely Kıyıkışlacık Köyü Turizmi Geliştirme ve Çevre Koruma Derneği.

Figure 4.2. Kıyıkışlacık, coffee-shops (kahvehane)
Active rural life can be identified under the ‘contemporary socio-economic values’ as defined by
Feilden and Jokilehto (1998, pp. 20-21).
326

174

V4. Interaction with excavations327: The Iasos excavations which continued until
2014 were significant for the local community as a means of generating economic
income. Both hosting the excavation team and working on the excavations provided a
major source of economic benefit for the locals over a long period of time328.
V5. Awareness of archeological heritage329: The local awareness of the
archeological heritage of Iasos is a result of the combination of the efforts of the
excavation team and local people participating in the excavations as workers. The
“Kermes Days” and “School Days” were organized by the excavation team to inform
children about Iasos and its archeological heritage. Such social activities, which took
place on the archeological site in such places as the bouleuterion, Balık Pazarı
Museum and the Agora, were helpful in increasing local awareness. Currently, the
local community has a basic knowledge about the archeological site, including the
myths and stories noted by Strabo. Local awareness of their archeological heritage is
an important factor in conserving the archeological remains and increasing local
participation in the planning process.

Values regarding the man-made components
V6. Ancient city of Iasos330: Representing earlier periods of the interaction between
humans and nature interaction, the existence of the remains of the ancient city of Iasos
is considered to be the most significant value of the site. As a significant Carian
settlement, the site has a historical and documentary value. Additionally, the intraurbem site of Iasos is physically isolated from local rural development by virtue of its

Interaction with excavations can be identified under the ‘economic value’ as defined by Feilden and
Jokilehto (1998, p. 21).
328
The Iasos excavations were started in the early 1960s and continued until 2014.
329
Awareness of archeological heritage can be identified under the ‘educational value’ and ‘social
value’ as defined by Feilden and Jokilehto (1998, p. 20).
330
Ancient city of Iasos can be identified under several group of values, such as ‘identity value’,
‘technical value’, and ‘educational value’ as defined by Feilden and Jokilehto (1998, pp. 18-20).
327

175

location on the peninsula and its designation as a 1st grade archeological site. This
creates the opportunity to reveal and preserve the archeological vestiges on the
promontory and presenting the promontory in its totality through a suitable a
management plan.
V7. Active use of chamber tombs331: The chamber tombs of the necropolis located
on the mainland are occupied by local residents as a result of the private ownership of
the land332. Today, all the chamber tombs with the exception of a monumental example
located on the quay of the Little Harbor and the so-called Balıkpazarı are privately
owned. The current functions of the chamber tombs that are in use include depots and
a kitchen for the excavation center, and as residential service buildings, such as store
rooms, garages, barns, chicken coop and a toilet (Figure 4.16). However, nearly half
of the privately owned chamber tombs remain unused.
Re-functioning the chamber tombs achieved a level of conservation due to the efforts
made to restore the buildings and conduct basic maintenance and repairs. While the
privately owned chamber tombs have received basic maintenance and repair from
local residents, the monumental chamber tomb was restored and functions as the
service building for excavation center together with another tomb in its courtyard. The
chamber tombs that are not in use, on the other hand, are either ruined or have serious
structural problems in terms of materials and bearing system (Figure 4.17). This has
resulted in the existence of the local community in Kıyıkışlacık village and their
refunctioning of the chamber tombs area considered to be a value in terms of
conserving archeological heritage.
V8. Traditional buildings of the old village333: As mentioned earlier, the present-

This site-specific value, can be identified under the ‘identity value’, ‘technical value’, and
‘functional value’ as defined by Feilden and Jokilehto (1998, pp. 18-20).

day built environment includes the remains of some traditional village houses and
olive oil plants which were associated with the old village of Asin Kurin. The presence
of the traditional buildings is valuable in terms of both providing historical
information about the village and reflecting the identity of the rural settlement.
However, much of the traditional tissue can no longer be seen due to alterations such
as the addition of extensions, changing the organization of façades and plastering the
buildings. In fact, only five traditional houses survive in their original form and
structure, with the remaining traditional houses being either abandoned or ruined.
According to the information provided by Ahmet Çakır, the traditional houses are
abandoned when the owners die and only one traditional house is currently
inhabited334.
The presence of the olive oil mills and presses in a good state of preservation is another
value; only one located at the entrance to the archeological site is seriously dilapidated
due to being abandoned. In fact, the traditional production units existing inside the
buildings represent significant potential in terms of reviving their use.

V9. Qualified built environment335: The present built environment of Kıyıkışlacık
is qualified in terms of new building activities in the core of the rural settlement. In
fact, the new buildings present a semblance order in terms of building height and color.
As mentioned earlier, the majority of new buildings have two storeys, except along
the main artery of the village. In addition, most houses are painted white, creating a
harmonious appearance to the village.

4.2. Threats
Threats regarding natural components
T1. Environmental pollution: The value of the coastal location and fishing activities
also creates threats to the environment. As mentioned by Serin, waste products from
fish farming activities are left scattered around the hills surrounding the rural
settlement336. Güllük Bay itself is also threatened by pollution mainly caused by the
disposal of domestic waste from the settlement, fish farming activities and the side
effects of coastal shipping transporting feldspar337.
T2. Loss of agricultural lands: As mentioned earlier, the increase in the construction
of the secondary houses on the western and eastern peripheries has caused the loss of
agricultural land formerly covered in olive groves.
T3. Coastal location: The coastal location of Kıyıkışlacık and the archeological site
of Iasos is favorable in terms of fishing activities as mentioned earlier. However, the
location of the site on the Aegean coast also produces negative impacts on the rural
settlement due to the increase in tourist interest in summer season. This tourist interest
mainly concerns domestic tourists who own secondary houses on the periphery of the

336
337

Serin, 2005b, p. 477.
Yıldız, Doğan and Urla, 2002, p. 143.

179

village of Kıyıkışlacık as a summer residence. The increasing interest being shown in
secondary house ownership threatens the peripheries of the rural settlement where the
agricultural land is the primary interaction area between the rural community and
nature. The construction of more secondary houses also compromises the possibility
of further excavations of as yet undiscovered archaeological remains in the territory
around Iasos; a potential noted by Pierobon Benoit338.

Threats regarding socio-cultural components
T4. Change in the population: As previously noted, rural settlements are faced with
the problem of migration from rural settlements to urban areas by families seeking
higher quality social services such as education, health and socio-cultural facilities,
and the better job opportunities resulting from the processes of urbanization. Since
sustaining the existence of the local community is the major component of the identity
of a rural settlement, migration threatens the sustainability of the rural identity by
exacerbating the loss of traditions regarding daily-life, building techniques and
production patterns. The rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık also faces this migration
threat, particularly regarding the loss of the young population. As noted by the local
community, younger members of the community leave the village for educational
purposes and have a tendency to settle in urban settlements to take advantage of the
job opportunities.

Threats regarding man-made components
T5. Disconnection with the surrounding heritage sites: Both the Gulf of Mandalya
and the ancient region of Caria include a number of archeological sites such as
Barglyia,
338

Beçin,

Halicarnassus,

Herakleia-Latmos,

Pierobon Benoit, 2012, p. 118.

180

Labraunda,

Milet,

Mylasa,Stratonikea and so on. However, there is no general overarching approach to
presenting these archeological sites as significant components of an important
network. The territory around Iasos also includes significant archeological remains
resulting from a long sequence of settlements on the site339. Zindafkale and Çanacik
Tepe are the most significant of these archeological sites and are located on the hills
to the north. Although the Archeological Survey of the Gulf of Mandalya revealed the
surrounding archeological sites and proposed a system of pedestrian itineraries aiming
to connect different sites in an integrated presentation approach, the necessary
permission for the implementation of the project was never provided by the Ministry
of Culture and Tourism. Thus, the interaction between Iasos and its surrounding
territory cannot yet be experienced.
T6. Abandoned traditional buildings: The traditional tissue of the old rural
settlement cannot be fully experienced at present. Although the remaining traditional
buildings have a documentary value and are integral parts of the identity of the rural
settlement, most of the traditional buildings, including both houses and olive oil plants
are suffering from structural problems.
One of the main reasons for this is their abandonment after the death of the owners
and the migration of the younger generations to urban centers. In fact, the abandoned
traditional houses have either collapsed or have serious structural problems because
of the lack of care and maintenance. At present in the village, there remain eleven
traditional buildings with 40% of them being either in a bad structural condition or
partially collapsed due to disuse. Similarly, three olive oil plants constructed in the
1970s now lie abandoned340. Oil production ceased in 1997 and the buildings have
been inactive for 20 years. The olive oil plant located at the entrance of the
archeological site is partially ruined with serious structural problems. Although the
structural condition of the two other olive oil plants is relatively sound, some parts of

339

181

their component dökek located in the courtyard have collapsed.
T7. Regional Planning decisions: The decisions of the 1/100.000 scale regional plan
instigated a general tendency in the coastal settlements, by permitting the construction
of second homes and tourist facilities around the existing settlements. This approach
has an erosive effect on the rurality of the area and the identity of Kıyıkışlacık and
constitutes a threat to the archeological site by increasing the housing density and
changing the function of land use in the surrounding areas. In fact, the entire rural
settlement is now open to preferential land use i.e., the secondary housing option.
Besides, tourist facilities are now allowed on the opposite site of the Little Harbor,
which has an archeological potential with evidence of extra-urban remains, as well as
in the eastern part of the periphery currently occupied by secondary houses.

Figure 4.7. 100.000 scale regional development plan decisions on the territory of
Iasos and Kıyıkışlacık (URL 26)

182

T8. Absence of a conservation plan: Including both traditional and archeological
heritage within its boundaries, the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık has a cultural
significance which needs to be preserved with all of its components. Although the first
conservation decision was taken in 1977, no conservation plan was prepared. Despite
a plan being prepared in 1996, this was not approved by the Conservation Council of
Muğla. In addition, this plan was essentially a development plan, which did not place
emphasis on the archeological heritage and traditional buildings. At present,
conservation decisions are partly taken by the Conservation Council of Muğla, but an
integrated conservation approach is still lacking.
T9. Partial planning: Due to the absence of a comprehensive plan and the relevant
decisions regulating the development of the settlement, partial plans are applied on the
eastern and western peripheries of the settlement. Under these plans, large areas have
been left open to the construction of secondary houses, which would be located on the
territory of Iasos having the possibility of containing archeological remains. In
general, partial plans are discussed for developing decisions on a specific area in
ignorance of the wider environmental context. In fact, partial plans are misleading in
terms of encouraging the physical development of the area concerned without any
holistic approach on a settlement scale. In the case of Kıyıkışlacık, the partial plans
also cause the virtual destruction of areas which have great potential to contain as yet
unrevealed archeological heritage and these plans adversely change the agricultural
character of the peripheral zones by introducing large construction areas.
T10. Unfinished constructions: Both on the eastern section of the periphery and the
west of the promontory, large areas of land are occupied by construction projects
which have been suspended by a court order341. Although a partial plan was prepared
for the development of secondary housing and hotel areas on the eastern periphery,
the buildings have not been completed on the upper slopes (Figure 4.8). Similarly, a
social facility comprising a public institution planned to the west of the promontory

341

183

has been left unfinished and the land has thus been occupied by unfinished
construction projects since the 1990s342. The western part of the promontory has a
great archeological potential which includes the remains of chamber tombs on the
slopes facing the Little Harbor. However, future archeological studies are obstructed
and the natural silhouette is marred by the existence of uncompleted buildings (Figure
4.9).

T11. Conservation decisions: In the previous chapter, the site boundaries and
designation decisions regarding Iasos and Kıyıkışlacık were presented according to
the data provided by the Conservation Council of Muğla. The designations and
grading of archeological sites343 have significant impacts on the conservation of
archeological heritage and the development of rural settlements. In reality, the grading
of archeological sites, the decision making process, and the control and management
mechanisms of Conservation Councils cause significant degradation to the
archeological and traditional heritage of Kıyıkışlacık.
As noted earlier, the entire promontory and parts of the mainland near the isthmus are
designated as 1st degree archeological sites. In addition, a large area on the mainland
is designated as a 3rd degree archeological site. In this latter archeological site
surrounding the mainland walls, a prehistoric necropolis and the so-called Clock
Tower are designated as conservation areas. However, when the site boundaries are
analyzed in detail, it can be recognized that the boundaries of the 1st degree
archeological site do not follow a reasonable order. It follows a semi-circular line on
the promontory without any concern for the built environment or ownership pattern.
In fact, the 1st degree archeological site includes the so-called Balık Pazarı and a
monumental chamber tomb which is now used as the kitchen of the excavation house
on the mainland, while simultaneously excluding the pre-historic necropolis. Rather
than including the pre-historic necropolis in the 1st degree archeological site, a
conservation area is designated around the remains. However, this conservation area
is designated on the northeastern side of the excavated area and does not cover the
entire excavated site (Figure 4.10)344.
Although the regulations do not allow new construction activities within the
boundaries of 1st degree archeological sites, the 1st degree archeological site at Iasos
includes a major part of the rural settlement and the construction of several new
343

The information about grading of archeological sites is given in Chapter 2, pp. 41-43.
This misidentification of the conservation area has probably been caused by the thick vegetation and
the closure of the excavation years ago.

buildings was detected during the site surveys. Similarly, designations of 3rd degree
archeological sites are thought to keep the conservation of archeological heritage and
land use in balance345. However, the land use development and implementation on
buildings are not controlled and most of the buildings are not submitted by the
landowners to the Conservation Council according to the information provided by
local landowners346. In fact, the preparation of a conservation plan is obligatory after
the designation of an archeological site according to the legal regulations. Moreover,
temporary decisions on physical development and implementations should be
identified by the responsible conservation council during the plan preparation
process347. Yet, such information was not provided by the Conservation Council of
Muğla.

T12. Private land ownership: Private land ownership on both the promontory and
mainland is now the most significant issue in regard to the problems of the coexistence
of rural settlements and archeological sites. Since the first cadastral plan was prepared
before the conservation decisions on the archeological site in 1977, the great majority
of the land containing archeological remains was owned privately. Although some
land on the promontory was expropriated after the designation of the 1st degree
archeological site, private land ownership still dominates the promontory348. In fact,
approximately 67 % of land containing archeological heritage is privately owned
(Figure 4.19). The main issues caused by private ownership of the archeological
remains and/or reserve areas are:


Limitations on excavations



Inappropriate presentation of the archeological site



Damage to the archeological heritage by olive picking and animal grazing



Unconscious use of archeological remains

The private land ownership affects the conservation of the archeological heritage of
Iasos, the conduct of excavations, and the presentation of the archeological site, and
results in damage to the remains.
Indeed, excavations are directly affected by the land ownership in Turkey349. The
excavated areas at Iasos are being conducted in the lands that were expropriated and,
a large amount of the archeological site awaits investigation. Thus, there are
considerable gaps between the excavated areas of Iasos, which directly effects the
interpretation and the presentation of the archeological site as a whole.

348

On the promontory, the Agora and surrounding structures such as the Bouleuterion , the Area of
Artemis Astias and Caesareum, complexes inside the East Gate, a Middle Byzantine Church located on
the northeastern coast of the promontory facing Big Harbor, Theatre and the residential area on its
southeastern side, the House of Mosaics and residential quarter on its western side, the Castrum of the
Acropolis and small pieces of land on the southeastern coast and on the mainland, Balıkpazarı,
Prehistoric necropolis and the monumental chamber tomb which has been used lately as part of the
excavation center have been expropriated according to the ownership information that the Municipality
of Milas provided.

Serin, 2005b, p. 477.

187

This gap between the excavated and unexcavated areas is not the only problem caused
by the private land ownership affecting the presentation of the archeological site350.
The pedestrian circulation and itineraries are obstructed by fences and/or stone walls
dividing the private land holdings (Figure 4.11).

Figure 4.11. Iasos, archeological remains surrounded by fences

The conservation of the archeological vestiges is another issue affected by the private
land ownership. Typically, the local people have a tendency to benefit from their land
by cultivating their olive trees and/or by grazing animals on the promontory. In
addition, the legal regulations and governmental approaches to the privately owned
land on the promontory are irrelevant to the problems for heritage sites generated by
the private land ownership issue. As mentioned earlier, seasonal agricultural activities
are allowed by legal regulations on the designated archeological sites351. In addition,
olive groves are protected by the Law No: 3573 which restricts the felling of olive
trees352. The local people also noted that their applications for the expropriation or the

350

351

188

exchange of their land are not accepted by the local authorities 353. As a result, both
olive picking and animal grazing, as the major economic activities of the local
community, take place on the promontory, i.e., on the main archeological site.
Naturally, the archeological remains are affected by these uncontrolled activities. The
transportation of the olives from the archeological site is one of the main problems
threatening the archeological remains. For instance, as noted by Serin, serious damage
was done to the marble pavements of the agora in 2005 354. Animal grazing also
damages the archeological site as a result of uncontrolled movement of the cattle and
the deposition of their waste on the remains, such as the mosaics of the House of
Mosaics (Figure 4.13).

Figure 4.12. Iasos, a villager standing on the archeological remains to pick up olives

On the mainland, the privately owned chamber tombs are either abandoned or
misused. The appropriate consolidation, conservation and presentation cannot be
implemented due to their ownership status and the use of some chamber tombs, as
barns, stables or service units, is inappropriate and damaging. Similarly, the
abandoned ones are left to fall into ruin (Figure 4.17).

Serin, 2005, p. 477.

189

Figure 4.13. Iasos, animal grazing on the archeological site (left); animal waste
within the House of Mosaics (right)

Although the private land ownership causes irreversible changes and damage to the
archeological remains, it also creates a milieu for the interaction of the local
community and archeological site. As mentioned earlier, in some cases conservation
is achieved at a certain level by the active use of chamber tombs serving as residential
units. By providing a basic level of maintenance and repair, the local residents have
prevented the destruction of the chamber tombs. Similarly, by olive picking and
animal grazing, the locals continuously use the promontory and are in close contact
with the archeological heritage. Thus, the private land ownership can also be
considered as a potential, as an interaction area for archeological property and the local
community of the rural settlement.
T13. Interrupted excavations: The excavations of Iasos are considered to be one of
the oldest excavations done by an Italian team355. Following uninterrupted excavations
for more than fifty years, a significant amount of restoration and consolidation work
took place on the promontory and some parts of the mainland. However, the
excavations ceased in 2014 and the site was transferred to the responsibility of the
Museum of Milas. Although a collaboration of the Museum of Milas and Selçuk
University was appointed for the archeological study of Iasos, no excavation studies
355

Levi, 1986, p. 12.

190

have been carried out since 2014.
With the interruption of the excavations and the de-authorization of the Italian
excavation team, the maintenance of both the archeological remains and the
presentation activities on the promontory have been negatively affected. In the
absence of a monitoring processes, conservation implementations lose their
effectiveness, causing irreversible damage to the archeological remains. For instance,
the roof of the House of Mosaics was damaged during the winter season of 2015 and
moss has started to cover the mosaics (Figure 4.14).

Figure 4.14. Iasos, the House of Mosaics, problem of dampness

T14. Presentation of the archeological site: It can be said that the ineffective
presentation of the archeological site of Iasos results from a combination of a series
of problems, such as the private land ownership, the interruption of excavations and
the absence of a comprehensive conservation plan. The problems regarding the
presentation of the archeological site can be identified as the inappropriate
implementations on the measures for the orientation of visitors, the disrupted
excavation studies and the lack of any connection between the vestiges on the
promontory and those on the mainland. To begin with, the maintenance of the
presentation implementations regarding the orientation of visitors in the archeological

191

site could not be carried through due to the limited nature of the archeological studies
after the closure of the excavations conducted by the Italian team in 2014. In reality,
the guidance for visitors has broken down because of the illegibility of the information
panels, an absence of an adequate visitor itinerary on the promontory and difficulties
with the accessibility of several sections of the archeological site (Figure 4.15).
Secondly, disrupted excavations lead to serious deterioration of archeological assets
due to the lack of monitoring. In addition, the whole promontory is now covered by
vegetation so that even the pedestrian routes can no longer be identified. Lastly, there
is lack of any links between the archeological remains on the promontory and those
on the mainland, including the mainland wall, chamber tombs, and the so-called Balık
Pazarı and the Clock Tower. In fact, the experience of visitors is often limited to the
promontory only.

archeological site

192

4.3. Overall Evaluation
To sum up, the existence of the archeological remains of the ancient city of Iasos
dominates the interaction of local community with nature as the main characteristic of
the rural settlement. In fact, Iasos is a prominent component of the rural identity of
Kıyıkışlacık. Thus, assessing the values of the integration of Iasos and Kıyıkışlacık
with a categorization based on a context of rurality in terms of natural, socio-cultural
and man-made components reveals the significance of the organic relationship
between local community and archeological heritage. Due to this relationship being
outside the control of the restrictive regulations of the governmental institutions, this
interaction, ironically, also threatens the archeological heritage itself as well as the
rurality of the settlement.
It should be noted that, emerging from the assessed values and threats, the integrated
structure still has significant potential through this interaction between the local
community and the archeological heritage and could include the conservation of the
archeological site. The most significant potential is related to the private land
ownership, which is the most pivotal problem threatening the conservation of
archeological heritage. In fact, the relationship between the local community and its
archeological heritage is actually sustained by the private use of land on the
promontory and the chamber tombs on the mainland. Using the archeological site for
olive growing activities integrates the archeological heritage on the promontory into
rural life-style of the community. Similarly, re-using the chamber tombs on the
mainland makes the archeological heritage an integral part of the daily lives of the
villagers as well as providing an opportunity for the preservation of the archeological
heritage. Such an integration, together with the awareness of the local community,
creates another potential. So that the participation of the local community in any
planning and management process regarding the rural settlement and archeological
heritage presents an opportunity for achieving an example of integrated conservation
practices.

193

Another potential arises from the natural values as the qualified olives provided by
nature to the Aegean region. This means that, together with other settlements located
on the Aegean coast, Kıyıkışlacık has an opportunity to participate in regional olive
related networks through its olive and olive oil products. As mentioned earlier, olives
and their traditional production culture are on UNESCO’s agenda for designating
particular areas as world heritage sites. In addition, specific quality registrations are
in place for olive products with several branding systems on a global scale, such as
PDO and PGI, which labels the products of olives as “original” to ensure the quality
of the olives and their production in a specific location by a system of specific rules356.
The integration of the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık with its surrounding olive
groves as the main source of income creates an enormous potential for the
development of the rural settlement.
For the preservation of the assessed values and the mitigation of the inherent threats,
controlling the development and interventions on site by integrated conservation
planning and management practices are crucially needed. Accordingly, the revealed
potentials of the integration should be considered and taken as basis for the
formulation of future principles and strategies.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND STRATEGIES FOR THE INTEGRATED
CONSERVATION OF IASOS-KIYIKIŞLACIK (MUĞLA)

Given the numerous archeological sites in the rural landscapes of Turkey, studies on
their relationship with rural settlements have gained prominence in the field of
archeological conservation. In the Turkish experience, villages were not considered as
integral components of archeological sites until the 1980s as a result of general
approach tending to consider the cultural heritage as a series of single assets. Thus,
either the archeological remains were collected and presented in museums, or villages
were moved from their original locations. Currently, as the socio-physical
environment of archeological heritage sites is now considered to be the sum of their
integral parts, the coexistence of rural settlements and archeological sites is becoming
disrupted. Archeological heritage sites are only regulated by the designation of their
archeological site boundaries which is based on a scale of 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree
archeological sites. According to the degree of an archeological site, building activities
are regulated and controlled by the local conservation councils. However, the nature
of the grading of archeological sites and the related regulations lead to a series of
problems357. Moreover, no precise or consistent approach prevails regarding rural
planning taking into consideration the conservation and development of rural
settlements with all of their components, including archeological sites. Nevertheless,
archeological sites and rural settlements need a specific planning approach embracing
comprehensive and integrated conservation considerations; an issue this study is
mainly focused on.
Among the different types of archeological sites integrated with rural settlements, the
357

199

most powerful interaction can be experienced in overlapping sites where an active
relationship between archeological remains and villages exists; the case of IasosKıyıkışlacık is considered to be a striking example of overlapping cases in Turkey,
with its organic integration of the village of Kıyıkışlacık with the remains of the
ancient city of Iasos. In fact, the physical and socio-economic integration of
archeological remains into the daily routines of rural life can be observed at
Kıyıkışlacık. Understanding this integration and assessing the values which have
evolved in the course of the historical process are the main objectives of this study
directed towards the development of an integrated approach for archeological heritage
and rural settlements. For this purpose, the historical and physical development
processes and the present built environment have been analyzed and evaluated in the
previous chapters. In this chapter, the main outcomes of this study on the archeological
sites and rural settlements are discussed, and a set of basic principles and strategies
are developed for the integrated conservation of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık

5.1. Main Outcomes and Objectives
The fundamental and most significant outcome of this study is the quality of
authenticity resulting from the integration between the archeological site of Iasos and
the village of Kıyıkışlacık. Although certain common values and threats can be
observed in similar examples, the main inputs of conservation and management
decisions regarding the site are quite unique and place-specific; the authentic
coexistence of a specific community in a specific geography with a specific
archeological heritage site creates this unique character and identity. The main
outcomes regarding the evaluation of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık are presented below:


The archeological site of Iasos and the village of Kıyıkışlacık are both
physically and socio-economically integrated.



The remains of the ancient city of Iasos have become an integral and dominant
component of the rural identity of the village of Kıyıkışlacık, as indicated by

200

the names given to the different facilities serving tourism and the service
sectors, as well as the archeological remains and myths as the images of the
settlement358.

Figure 5.1. Images of Iasos in the current built environment



The integration of the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık with the archeological
site of Iasos has been achieved by the existence of certain “connectors”. These
connectors are chamber tombs, the excavation team, private land ownership,
olive trees, and summer tourism.

358

A myth about a dolphin and a child had been told by different scholars. The image of the dolphin
with a child is still commonly used; for instance, on the logos of the commercial facilities and façade
ornamentations.

201

1. Chamber tombs
In this study, the chamber tombs are considered the most significant connector
between the villagers and the ancient city of Iasos by providing shelter for the
villagers when they first arrived at Iasos359. Today, the chamber tombs are still
in use by the local community as service units for present day residential
buildings (Figure 5.2). Conserving the chamber tombs and integrating them
into the daily life, instead of demolishing them and building new structures
shows the symbolic importance of these chamber tombs for the local
community.

Figure 5.2. The use of chamber tombs during the formation of the rural settlement

2. Excavation team
The presence of the Italian excavation team for more than 50 years has been
another factor in fostering awareness among the local community regarding
359

The information about the use of the chamber tombs has been provided by travelers. Richard
Chandler wrote about the Greek families living in chamber tombs in order to guarding the remains of
Iasos. Similarly, the first arrivals after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey after 1923
also used the chamber tombs as shelters until proper living accommodation had been built, according
to the oral information provided by local residents.

the archeological site, by including villagers in the excavation work and
providing additional sources of income. This interaction with the local
community was one of the main aims of the excavation team360. Increasing
local awareness was not only achieved by the excavation work, but also by
involving the children of the village in organizations such as the “Kermes
Days” and “School Days” on the archeological site.

3. Private land ownership
As mentioned earlier, the cadastral plan was prepared before the designation
of the archeological site361. Thus, a certain amount of the archeological
remains on both the promontory and mainland had already received the status
of privately owned properties. Although some damage, such as irreversible
alterations and material deterioration can be observed as the results of this
process, private land ownership has generated the physical interaction between
the villagers and the remains of the ancient city of Iasos. Rather than
experiencing the disadvantages of interruption by the expropriation of the land,
the local inhabitants obtained the direct use their lands situated on the
promontory for agricultural production and animal grazing as their basic
economic activity. Thus, the private land ownership is also evaluated here as
a connector in the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık.

4. Olive trees
Olive trees have been a dominant element of both the rural landscape and the
image of the promontory. Indeed, Texier notes the density of olive trees and
set fire to the tees on the promontory in order to see the remains more
clearly362. At present, the olive trees cover the entire surface of the promontory,

360

Activities regarding the interaction with the local community are included in the annual excavation
reports with details and photographs. For some of these photographs see Chapter 3, p. 104, Figure 3.15.

which is mostly owned by private individuals. As a result of the private land
ownership, the villagers habitually visit the archeological site to pick the olives
at certain times of the year (Figure 5.3)363. Thus, olive trees are considered to
be a significant connector between the archeological site of Iasos and the
village of Kıyıkışlacık as the main economic activity of the inhabitants.

5. Summer tourism
Tourism, as a developing economic factor, provides a new source of income
for the local community of Kıyıkışlacık. It is manifested in the increase in
secondary housing and accommodation facilities in the village as a result of

363

The season of olive picking differs according to the type of the olive products. According to the
information given by the villagers, olives are picked between September and December.

the coastal location of the village. In fact, tourism related activities can be
observed in the summer season, while the emergence of cultural tourism
related to the archeological site of Iasos is, at present, quite limited364.
However, the development of boutique hotels, pensions and cafes, as well as
the secondary housing facilities, makes Iasos a more interesting place for
tourists to visit.


The organic formation and development of villages without any appropriate
regulation may cause serious damage to the archeological heritage365. The
rural planning practices with considerations on the conservation of
archeological heritage should be developed for the integrated sites of
archeological heritage and rural settlements.



Although archeological studies and excavations, as well as the presentation of
the archeological heritage, are directly related to the ownership of the land, a
policy of total expropriation may not be an option in the rural settlements. In
the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık the applications made by the villagers to the
government for expropriation have not been accepted366. Thus, there is a need
to explore new approaches to privately owned land that contains archeological
heritage.

As a result of this study on the integration of rural settlements and archeological sites,
with particular emphasis on the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık, the need for a local
approach on the conservation of archeological heritage located within the rural
landscapes has been identified. The main consideration of such an approach should be
a much deeper understanding of the dynamics of an organically developed
coexistence, and the conservation of the values created by this process of integration.

Statistical data gives the number of tourists visiting Iasos as 1576 and Balık Pazarı Museum as 2049,
which is relatively low when compared to the total number of tourists visiting museums and
archeological sites within the boundaries of the Province of Muğla (URL 29).

Conservation of the values of the rural settlement and of its local community is also
required since these are integral parts of their unique characteristics. In this manner,
the interaction between humans and nature as the basic component of the rural identity
should be sustained by ensuring the continuity of the traditional life style and
economic activities of the rural settlement. However, due to the lack of coherent rural
planning approaches and local control systems in Turkey, the rural settlements are
under the threat of urbanization and counter-urbanization processes367. Thus, the
management of the rural landscapes, together with all their values, arises as a critical
issue.
The main outcomes of the present study about the site, which are presented above,
should be considered as inputs for any type of intervention in both the archeological
site and rural settlement. As mentioned earlier, these inputs are place-specific and need
to be investigated in each different specific settlement to discover the dynamics of the
integration and provide their sustainability. As achieved in this study, a detailed
historical and physical analysis of the integration by the identification of each
component should be considered. The evaluation phase should provide the basic
connectors and values/threats associated with each site and, accordingly, the
conservation strategies that could be developed for each site.

5.2. Principles and Strategies for the Integrated Conservation of IasosKıyıkışlacık
The analysis and evaluation of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık in Chapters 3 and 4 are respectively
structured in order to understand the components and motivations of the integration,
and identify the main objectives through the assessment of values and problems. It is

367

The urbanization processes have led to the migration from rural to urban settlements in search for a
higher quality of life through better social facilities. The counter-urbanization, on the other hand, creates
a danger for rural settlements by encouraging migration from urban to rural settlements because of the
polluted city environments and hectic lifestyles. For further information about these concepts, see
Champion, 2001; Hill, 2003; and Mitchell, 2004.

206

aimed to achieve integrated conservation by the identification of the main principles,
the strategies of each principle, and actions; with the previously determined
connectors being defined as the tools for the application of these strategies.

Figure 5.4. The main structure of the strategy-making process

With the aim of conserving the values resulting from the integration of these two types
of settlements, and overcome the problems and threats created through the process,
the three main principles determined for implementing integrated conservation are as
follows:
P1. Sustaining the integration of the archeological site of Iasos with the village of
Kıyıkışlacık, as the most important component of the area’s rural identity.
P2. Conserving the values of both the archeological site of Iasos and the traditional
houses and olive oil plants of Kıyıkışlacık, together with their construction techniques
and the materials.
P3. Managing the rural development to ensure the conservation of the rural identity
and archeological heritage by alleviating the threat factors.
These principles are the main objectives for approaching the values of both the

207

remains of Iasos and the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık. The strategies regarding the
sustainability of the integration of the archeological site of Iasos and the village of
Kıyıkışlacık concentrate on the relationship between the archeological site and the
rural settlement by ensuring the continuity of the rural lifestyle with all of its
components. The strategies of the second principle mainly focus on the threats and the
conservation problems affecting the archeological site and the traditional buildings of
Kıyıkışlacık. The last principle, i.e., the management of rural development, aims to
control the interventions to the archeological and traditional heritage, and the
continuation of new building activities by determining a set of rules and regulations
within a comprehensive planning and a participatory administrative approach.

Strategies for the Sustainability of the “Coexistence”
The coexistence of the archeological site of Iasos and the rural settlement of
Kıyıkışlacık is considered a crucial component of the rural identity of the surrounding
landscape, as well as one of the reasons underlying the conservation of archeological
remains. As noted in Article 13 of the revised version of the Burra Charter (2013),
“the coexistence of cultural values should always be recognized, respected and
encouraged” 368. Thus, providing the sustainability of this coexistence is the main
objective of the integrated conservation of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık. The relevant strategies
are thus developed with the consideration of values and threats related to the basic
components of this integrity.
S1.1. Sustaining the rural economic activities: Agriculture, animal husbandry and
fishing, as the main economic activities of the rural settlement of Kıyıkışlacık, should
be supported and sustained to ensure the continuity of the existence of the local
community. In order to improve the quality of the products and provide agro tourism

368

See also ICOMOS, 2005, Article 2.

209

opportunities, an integration with regional agricultural networks should be supported
by educational, training, and information briefings369.
S1.2. Incorporating tourism into the rural identity: Although tourism can be
identified as a connector between the local community and the archeological site by
attracting interest in, and attention to the area, its integration with the rural settlement
is still limited. Thus, the touristic activities originating from the coastal location and
the archeological site of Iasos should be integrated to the rural identity. Such an
integration should include the presentation of the traditional values of the rural
settlement, such as a qualified local built environment and local products. Considering
the archeological site and the rural settlement, agro-tourism involving the olive groves
located on the promontory is proposed for involving tourists in the local production
processes and buying their products. Together with the agro-touristic activities, a
“Heritage Week” event is proposed to be organized in September. This event is aimed
at fostering an interaction between the excavation team, tourists and the local
community at the end of the excavation campaign during the harvest season. The
villagers would participate in this event by organizing the olive picking activities on
the mainland and providing accommodation services.
S1.3. Sustaining the economic and social integration with the archeological
heritage: For the sustainability of the powerful interaction between the local
community and archeological site, the archeological excavations, suspended since
2014, should be resumed as a mean of generating income and raising awareness.
S1.4. Increasing the accessibility of the site: Access to the village should be
improved by means of public transportation as a way of providing both an adequate
quality of life for the local community and opportunities for visits from the
surrounding settlements.

TaTuTa project on “Eco-Agro Tourism and Voluntary Knowledge and Skills Exchange on Organic
Farms” (URL 30), regional olive festivals and educational congresses which take place in the Aegean
Region are among the current regional networks promoting olives and olive products.

Strategies for the Conservation of the Values
As mentioned earlier, both the archeological site of Iasos and the rural settlement of
Kıyıkışlacık contain significant heritage value. The conservation of this value via a
holistic approach is one of the main principles of the approach for the case in this
study. The strategies for the conservation of these values, with particular emphasis on
the existing problems and threats, are presented as follows.
S2.1. Reopening the archeological excavations: For the conservation and
documentation of the remains of the archeological site of Iasos, the archeological
excavations suspended since 2014, should be resumed. The remains on the mainland
should also be integrated into the archeological investigation. A renting system is
hereby proposed for the privately owned land containing archeological heritage. This
would involve paying a price for the seasonal use of the private land to the owner for
continuing operations on the excavations without harming the existing olive trees.
This system should be tested on selected pilot areas.
S2.2. Documenting the cultural heritage: Both the archeological remains and the
traditional buildings of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık should be properly documented and
recorded in order to analyze their characteristics and physical conditions; using this
documentation, the 1/1000 scale base map should be revised370.
S2.3. Conservation of the traditional buildings: The empty traditional buildings
such as the old village houses and olive oil plants, which are in danger of collapse due
to the lack of maintenance and repair, should be protected through restoration and refunctioning applications or by taking the necessary structural precautions to prevent
further deterioration.

370

The importance of records is noted in Article 32.1 of the revised version of the Burra Charter as:
“The records associated with the conservation of a place should be placed in a permanent archive and
made publicly available, subject to requirements of security and privacy, and where this is culturally
appropriate” (ICOMOS, 2013).

211

S2.4. Connecting the archeological site on the promontory with its hinterland: As
mentioned earlier, the existing studies have concentrated on the promontory, while the
mainland still awaits further archeological investigation. The presentation of the
remains of the ancient city of Iasos should be integrated with the archeological sites
located in the territory within a more comprehensive regional approach.
S2.5. Awareness raising among the local community: Especially due to their being
privately owned, the conservation of both the archeological remains and the traditional
buildings is directly related to the attitudes of the local community. Thus, an
introduction to the basic principles for the conservation of archeological heritage and
explanations about the archeological remains should be provided by suitable experts
with educational programs, workshops and activities371.
S2.6. Defining the conservation principles for the chamber tombs: In order to
control the abuses and misuses of the chamber tombs by the villagers, some basic
functions and regulations should be determined by experts, and the local community
should be informed and consulted about these principles372.
S2.7. Presentation of the archeological site of Iasos on a territorial scale: A site
management plan for the presentation of the archeological site should be developed to
provide visitors with the opportunity of visiting the archeological site and
understanding the rural settlement with its traditional values and lifestyle. The
itineraries should include the archeological remains on both the promontory and
mainland as well as other territorial heritage sites, such as the Mainland Wall, Çanacık
Tepe and Zindaf Kale. A visitor information center, where the written documentation

The importance and the ways of increasing the public awareness is noted in Article 13 of the Xi’an
Declaration as: “Professional training, interpretation, community education and public awareness
should be encouraged to support such co-operation and sharing of knowledge as well as to promote
conservation goals, improve the efficiency of the protection tools, management plans and other
instruments” (ICOMOS, 2005).
372
According to Article 7.2 of the revised version of the Burra Charter, the compatible use of the
cultural heritage should be provided. The compatible use is defined in the same document as “respective
to the cultural significance of a place, with no or minimal impact on it” (ICOMOS, 2013).
371

212

and, guided tours are provided, should be located at a nodal point of the visitor
itineraries. In addition, appropriate car parking areas, legible information panels, and
observation and panoramic vista points should be organized. The tourists should also
be informed before visiting the site by a suitable web-site and mobile applications
containing general information about the site, e-publications, photographs and maps
regarding the Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık case.
S2.8. Restricting the extent of animal grazing on the promontory: Since the
majority of the land on the promontory is privately owned, much of the animal grazing
which provides one of the main sources of income for the rural settlement, takes place
on the archeological site. To avoid the damage caused by cows, new pasture areas
should be designated by the relevant governmental institutions on the land
surrounding the village. This would enable the grazing on the promontory to be
restricted to sheep and goats, and this only in specific periods to support the
sustainability of the relationship with the archeological site and cleaning back of much
of the vegetation should take place to provide an appropriate presentation of the site
and working space for the excavation team373.

Strategies for the Management of the Rural Development
The main issues threatening the conservation of the archeological heritage and rural
identity of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık stem from the uncontrolled interventions and
developments in the built environment, such as the misuse of chamber tombs and
construction of new buildings. This has resulted in the peripheries being subjected to
large scale construction activities through partial plans, with the necessary
permissions not being obtained for the construction of the new buildings at the center
of the village374. Thus, both the areas containing the potential presence of buried

373

An example of this can be seen in the archeological site of Magnesia on the Meander where goats
are grazed before the beginning of the excavation season.
374
Oral information provided by Ahmet Çakır: see Appendix C.

213

archeological remains and the characteristics of the rural landscape are being
threatened by the development of secondary housing areas. As a basic principle for
the conservation of Iasos and Kıyıkışlacık, such forms of development should be
controlled and managed by specific regulations.
S3.1. Establishing a collaboration between local community and governmental
institutions: The stakeholders in the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık can be identified as
the local community, local and central authorities, professional experts and tourists375.
In order to achieve a controlled development of the rural settlement and
simultaneously provide successful conservation of the archeological remains, a
collaboration should be established, including all the stakeholders, with a particular
emphasis on the needs of the local community. By means of this collaboration, a local
management system should be developed, with the participation of representatives
from the responsible municipalities, conservation council, and museum directorate.
With regular meetings, the decision-making and implementation processes should
take place within the framework of a participatory approach376.
S3.2. Preparation of a comprehensive conservation and management plan: In
order to control the developments and manage the interventions in the archeological
remains and traditional buildings in the village of Kıyıkışlacık, a comprehensive plan
should be prepared for the conservation of the archeological remains and the local
values of the rural settlement. In these processes, the above mentioned collaboration
should play an active role, and a participatory planning process should be achieved by
the involvement of all stakeholders. Basically, new building regulations, control
mechanisms for the future interventions, conservation principles for the traditional
buildings and archeological remains in the village and financial models to ensure
The concept of “association” is used in the Burra Charter in order to identify the groups that should
be involved in the conservation of cultural heritage. Article 1.15 defines this association as the
connections between people and place (ICOMOS, 2013). Tourists, as one the stakeholders here,
includes the residents of secondary houses and visitors to the archeological site of Iasos.
376
The participation of the groups associated with the place in different phases of the conservation
process is emphasized in Articles 12 and 26.3 of the revised version of the Burra Charter (ICOMOS,
2013).
375

214

future sustainability should be defined by the plan.
S3.3. Revision of the current archeological site boundaries: Rather than using the
existing regulations on archeological sites with a grading system, a new definition
should be developed for archeological sites overlapping with rural settlements,
embracing all the archeological remains on the mainland, in the case of Iasos, as well.
In the designation process, the following facts should be taken into consideration377.


In the light of the information provided by the Mandalya archeological survey,
a “core conservation area” including all remains of the ancient city of Iasos
should be identified.



In the light of the information provided by the Mandalya archeological survey,
an “interaction zone” should be identified, taking into consideration the
possible impacts of the developments on the surrounding areas.



Building regulations for these areas should take into account the potential
presence of still buried archeological remains waiting to be unearthed.
However, each case should be evaluated within its own specific context by the
local institutions responsible for the conservation of the cultural heritage, in
terms of material, mass and façade organization.

Actions on the Site
The present study focuses on the development of strategies for the integrated
conservation of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık. Accordingly, some basic actions for the
implementation of specific strategies on the site are proposed in this section. These
proposals may contribute to a more comprehensive conservation and management
plan based on conserving the values and alleviating the problems and threats. The list
of actions in relation to the strategies and the conceptual plan for the applications on
physical environment are presented below.

A1. Determination of visitor itineraries: For the presentation of the archeological
remains and traditional buildings on the promontory and the mainland, two different
visitor itineraries are proposed. Both the routes would start from the Clock Tower and

216

extend to the center of the rural settlement378. The inner itinerary covers the
promontory and the village, thus including the remains on the mainland such as the
Balık Pazarı Museum and the chamber tombs, as well as the traditional values of the
rural settlement, such as the old village houses and olive oil plants. For the traditional
buildings and privately owned chamber tombs an “observation route” is proposed in
relation to the inner itinerary. The outer itinerary as the second visitor route, covers
the archeological sites on territorial scale: the Mainland Wall, Cario-Lelegean
buildings, Çanacık Tepe and Zindaf Kale. Along the itineraries, a car parking area at
the entrance of the site and several observation points are proposed.
A2. Organization of four main centers: Along the visitor routes, four main centers
are proposed to be created by the revitalization and reactivation of the olive oil plants
and the monumental tomb located on the coast facing the Little Harbor.


Information center: A tourist information center is proposed in the olive oil
plant at the entrance to the promontory. The main function of this center would
be to provide basic services for the visitors, such as written information, maps,
organization of the guided tours, registration for workshops and educational
and agro-touristic activities.



Experience center: In the olive oil plant opposite the information center, an
experience center is proposed. Together with the agro-tourism activities on the
promontory, this center would provide an opportunity for visitors to participate
in a small scale olive-oil production process.



Observation center: Next to the reactivated olive oil plant located near to the
Balık Pazarı, an olive museum is proposed. The traditional production
apparatus in relation to olive and olive-based products will be exhibited in this
building. Together with the Balık Pazarı Museum, this area would provide
historical information about both the ancient city of Iasos and the village of

378

The center of the rural settlement is identified as the coastal line containing commercial and social
facilities.

217

Kıyıkışlacık.


Community center: By re-functioning the state owned monumental chamber
tomb, which is now assigned to the excavation team and used as the kitchen of
the excavation center, a community center is proposed. This center would act
as a venue for the regular meetings of the collaboration processes. In addition,
a local library will be located in this building, containing the published material
and reports about the excavation research. In this way, the interactions between
different stakeholders including the excavation team and governmental
institutions will be supported.

A3. Rehabilitation of a traditional house for the “Heritage Week” events: In the
build up to the staging of the heritage week, the traditional house and associated
courtyard containing chamber tombs, which is located on lot no: 12/582, will be
rehabilitated as an accommodation facility.
A4. Determination of the pilot excavation sites: Three main areas are selected for
the organization of education programs and workshops aiming at increasing the local
awareness regarding the archeological heritage and excavations. These areas would
be the area within the fortifications on the Isthmus, the basilica near the Balık Pazarı
and the remains of the building on the mainland known locally as the “Koca Bina”. In
these areas, the educational activities for the local community to participate in the
excavations will be organized and the renting system for the privately owned heritage
lands will be tested.
A5. Designation of the olive groves chosen for agro-tourism activities: The
privately owned olive groves on the promontory, which do not contain any visible
archeological remains, are proposed to be used for agro-tourism. These lands could be
operated by their owners so as to involve tourists in the olive picking activities
between September and December. In relation to the small scale production process
of the harvested olives, special areas in the current outdoor market are proposed for
the promotion and sale of these products.

218

A6. Removal of the unfinished constructions on the mainland to the west of the
Little Harbor: The buildings, which are currently uncompleted, are an eyesore and
need to be removed; something which would also protect the potential of the presence
of buried archeological remains. Such an intervention would provide an opportunity
for further archeological research on what is publicly owned land. Thus, the visitor
route could also cover the remains of the chamber tombs located on the same section
of the mainland.
A7. Rehabilitation of the unused traditional buildings and chamber tombs: In
order to prevent the privately owned traditional buildings and chamber tombs from
further collapse, their rehabilitation is proposed.

5.3. Challenges and Further Research
Within the scope of this study, the major concerns for the conservation of
archeological sites integrated with rural settlements are analyzed and strategies
proposed for the specific case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık. Although the general framework
for approaching such an integration includes an understanding the complex dynamics
affecting this case by analyzing and evaluating the formation of each component and
identifying the major integration concepts by connectors, each different case has its
own characteristics. In the real world, each rural settlement, by its nature, is quite
indigenous and unique, requiring each case to be approached afresh. Thus, further
research focusing on comparative analyses is crucial for developing general principles
and guidelines concerning the integration of archeological sites and rural settlements.
Moreover, the present study focuses on the physical indicators of such as integration
process with a particular emphasis on its social aspects. The inclusion of a social
survey is also needed for identifying a more comprehensive approach to the
opportunities of participatory planning in any future research. Furthermore, a study on
the financial model for a system involving the renting of privately owned land
containing archeological heritage would make a crucial contribution to the
sustainability of the approaches determined in this study. Apart from solely focusing
on the coexistence of rural settlements and archeological sites, the impact of this on
the character of the rural landscape and rural identity are other future research areas
identified in this study.
Studying the case of Iasos-Kıyıkışlacık is particularly beneficial and informative,
since this site is one of the most significant and intersecting examples of archeological
site and rural settlement integration in Turkey. However, the lack of resources
regarding the historical development of Kıyıkışlacık village has remained one of the
main challenges for the present study. The historical information has been gathered
through oral information provided by the local community and the detailed analysis
of aerial photographs dating back to different years starting from 1932. Another

223

difficulty was related to the archival problems of the Conservation Council of Muğla
caused by the transfer of the documents from İzmir. It should therefore be emphasized
that there may be missing documents regarding decisions on site designations and
building registrations.
In conclusion, although this study focuses on a specific case for assessing the values
and identifying the problems and threats involved in the integration of rural
settlements and archeological sites, it attempts to initiate the evolution of a general
framework for analyzing and evaluating such cases as well as proposing principles
and strategies that could be used in other similar cases. With the contribution of further
research including social and comparative aspects, it is hoped to contribute to rural
planning practices and guide their development towards the conservation of
archeological heritage.

Interviews
1. Ahmet Çakır, former security guide of the archeological site of Iasos
15.09.2016
Question: Köyün yerleşim tarihçesinden bahseder misiniz?
Answer: Bu bölgelerin sahibi eski zamanlarda üç Rum kardeşmiş: Constantine,
Yorgo ve Sabrina. Bu kardeşlerin arazileri nehirler ile belirlenmiş. Iasos
topraklarının ilk sahibi de bu üç kardeşten biri olan Yorgo Vasilya. Esasında ilk
köy 1925’lerden önce, Rumların zamanında köyün girişindeki kavşaktan 4 km
ileride kurulmuş. Mübadele zamanı bu üç kardeş arazileri satacağı zaman,
köylülerin çalışıp yaşadığı Asın Çiftliği’ni Mehmet Ali Akarca satın almış.
Zamanın çok bilinen, zengin ailelerinden, eski Milas Belediye Başkanı. O zamanın
parasıyla 130.000 Osmanlı parasına satın almış, bunların eski hudut tapuları
duruyor. Satın alınca da köylüleri yerleşimden çıkarmış. Yorgo ve Sabrina’nın
arazileri de devlet hazinesine geçmiş. 1925 yılında araziler terk edilince devlet
burayı eski yerleşimdeki insanlara tapularıyla dağıtmış. Buraya Kazıklı, Kızılağaç
ve Gürçamlar köylerinden de gelenler olmuş o dönemde. Köylüler buraya
geldiklerinde yalnızca mezar odaları varmış. Kendi evlerini yapana kadar burada,
mezarlarda yaşayıp çiftlikte çalışmışlar. Kuru in adı da buradan geliyor. Köyün ilk
adı Asin Kurin.
Q: Köydeki taş evler Asin Kurin zamanından bu yana mı kullanılmış?
A: Evet. Köydeki ilk evler bunlar. Ardıç hatıllarla yapılmış, damları da topraktan.
O dönem etrafta ne bulurlarsa kullanmışlar. Yıkık mezar temellerini kullanarak
üzerlerine evleri inşa etmişler. Iasos’dan da malzeme toplayıp kullanmışlar. Mezar
odaları da hep ardiye gibi kullanılmaya devam etmiş. Biz de hala öyle
kullanıyoruz.

251

Q: Sizin kullandığınız mezar odası nerede? Size mi ait?
A: Evet, benim eşimin üzerine tapusu. Mezar odalarının çoğu özel mülkiyette
zaten. Çünkü sit alanı ilan edilmeden önce geçti buraların kadastrosu. 1972 yılında
kadastro geçti, 1978’de sit alanı ilan edildi. Bu yüzden çoğu kalıntı özel
mülkiyette. Yarımada da zeytinlikler var, hep köylülerin arazileri.
Q: Iasos’un karşısında kalan inşaat ne durumda?
A: Orası bir devlet dairesinin sosyal tesisiydi, 80lerde yapmaya başladılar. Ama
sonra davalık oldular, yıllardır öyle inşaat halinde duruyor. Yarım kaldı, kimse de
gelip sökmedi.
Q: Köyde bulunan mezarlar koruma altında mı? Gelip kontrol ediyorlar mı?
A: Burası sit alanı tabi. Ara sıra kuruldan, müzeden gelirler bakarlar. Ama tescilli
değil mezarlar.
Q: Yeni yapı yaparken izin alıyor musunuz?
A: Köydeki yapılar ruhsatsız. Mahalle statüsüne de geçtik, çoğu kaçak yapıların.

16.09.2016
Question: Köyün yerleşim tarihçesinden bahseder misiniz?
Answer: Bizim annelerimiz, dedelerimiz ilerideki bir çiftlikte çalışırlarmış. Sonra
çiftlikten kovulunca gelip buraya yerleşmişler. Geldiklerinde yıkık dökük
mezarlar varmış burada. Kutu gibi, karanlık. Bu mezarlarda yaşamışlar evlerini
yapana kadar. Sonra da çıkıp hemen yanına evlerini yapmışlar. Ben çocuktum
hatırlıyorum, denizden bizim buralara ateş açmışlardı. Çok korkmuştuk, saklandık
evlere. Her yere tabancayla denizden ateş ettiler. O zaman dertleri neydi bilmem
ki.
Q: Eskiden yaşadığınız ev hala duruyor mu?
A: Duruyor, az ilerde aşağıda. Ama şimdi boş, yıkılmak üzere. Onun bahçesinde
de mezarlar vardı, saman, odun depolardık. Şimdi çer çöp dolmuştur. Onun az
aşağısında da zeytinyağı yaptığımız büyük taş binamız var. Balık Pazarı’nın
karşısında.
Q: Kullanılıyor mu şimdi ?
A: Yok, 10 yıl önce kapattık. Öylece duruyor şimdi, aletler hep eski tabi.
Zeytinliklerden gelen zeytinlerle yağ yapardık, satardık sonra.

16.09.2016
Question: Köyün yerleşim tarihçesinden bahseder misiniz?
Answer: Bizim köyümüz, 1929 yılında Asın Çiftliği’nde kurulmuştur. Karşıdaki
çiftlik, sahipleri Akarca ailesi. Bu çiftliğin en eski sahibinin Rum olduğunu
söylerler. Mübadeleden sonra Akarca’lar satın almış bu çiftlik arazilerini.
Tamamını satın almamışlar da bir kısmını da devlet tahsis etmiş o dönem. Çiftlik
Akarca’lara geçince, oradaki köylüler şimdiki yerleşim yerine gelmişler. Köylüler
o dönem buranın kuzeyinde, Ilbıra dağının eteklerinde bir köyde yaşarlarmış.
Orada yaşayıp Akarca çiftliğinde çalışırlarmış. İlk onlar gelmiş şimdiki köye.
Eskiden buralarda hep Roma mezarları varmış, oda gibi. Köylüler geldiklerinde
bu mezarlarda yaşamışlar. Düzenlemişler, tek gözlü ev haline getirip yerleşmişler.
Eğer bu mezarların damı yıkıksa da onarmışlar. Yan duvarlar ayakta olduğu için
ortadan bir kalasla destekleyip, tavanını kargılarla örüp üstüne çer çöp, ot, çalı
koymuşlar. En üste de greng toprak atıp çatı yapmışlar bu yıkık odalara.
Q: Asin Kurin adı da buradan mı geliyor?
A: Evet. Bu mezarlar penceresiz olduğu için “in” derlermiş. Kupkuru in, kuru in
demelerinin sebebi sıvasız, çıplak duvarlar ve pencere olmaması. Sonra zamanla
kurin olmuş bu deyiş. Asin de zaten çiftlikten geliyor. Böylece Asin Kurin
demişler köye. Sonradan Kıyıkışlacık oldu köyün adı. Bu da Gümrük
Karakolu’ndan geliyor. Şimdilerde İtalyan kazı ekibinin evi olan bina, eskiden
karakolmuş. Limanı kontrol eden askerler varmış. Kıyıkışlacık adı da buradan
geliyor.

local inhabitant.

254

Q: Mezar odaları hala kullanılıyor mu?
A: Evet. Eskiden beri kullanılıyor. İlk gelen köylüler kendi evlerini yapınca bu
odaları ahır, samanlık, depo yaptılar. Ama şimdi çoğu terkedildi, yıkık halde.
Q: Köyün temel geçim kaynağı zeytincilik değil mi?
A: Evet. Zeytin her zaman temel geçim kaynağı. Eskiden üç tane zeytinyağı
fabrikası vardı köyde. Şimdi hiçbiri çalışmaz bunların. Yıkıntı halindeler. Bir de
balıkçılık çok önemli. 90lardan beri köylüler balıkçılıktan da ciddi para kazanıyor.
Su Ürünleri Kooperatifi kuruldu burada, köyün neredeyse tamamı katılmıştı. Ama
sonra bakanlıktan geldiler, taşıyın dediler çiftlikleri. Biz de taşıdık. Tabi herkes
gidemedi açığa, üyelerin çoğu bıraktı çiftlikleri. Şimdi çok az üyesi var.
