Topographic Change Detection at Select Archeological
Sites in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 2007–2010

Abstract
Human occupation in Grand Canyon, Arizona, dates
from at least 11,000 years before present to the modern era.
For most of this period, the only evidence of human occupation in this iconic landscape is provided by archeological
sites. Because of the dynamic nature of this environment,
many archeological sites are subject to relatively rapid
topographic change. Quantifying the extent, magnitude,
and cause of such change is important for monitoring and
managing these archeological sites. Such quantification is
necessary to help inform the continuing debate on whether
and how controlled releases from Glen Canyon Dam, located
immediately upstream of Grand Canyon National Park, are
affecting site erosion rates, artifact transport, and archeological resource preservation along the Colorado River in
Grand Canyon. Although long-term topographic change
resulting from a variety of natural processes is inherent in
the Grand Canyon region, continued erosion of archeological sites threatens both the archeological resources and our
future ability to study evidence of past cultural habitation.
Thus, this subject is of considerable interest to National Park
Service managers and other stakeholders in the Glen Canyon
Dam Adaptive Management Program.
Understanding the causes and effects of archeological site erosion requires a knowledge of several factors,
including the location, timing, and magnitude of the changes
occurring in relation to archeological resources, the rates
of change, and the relative contribution of potential causes.
These potential causes include sediment depletion associated
with managed flows from Glen Canyon Dam, site-specific
weather and overland flow patterns, visitor impacts, and
long-term regional climate change. To obtain this information, highly accurate, spatially specific data are needed from
sites undergoing change. Using terrestrial lidar techniques,
and building upon three previous surveys of archeological sites performed in 2006 and 2007, we collected two
new datasets in April and September 2010 and processed
and improved upon existing methods to generate highaccuracy (3 to 5 cm vertical change threshold) topographic
change-detection maps for 10 survey areas encompassing 9

archeological sites along the Colorado River corridor. We
also used terrestrial lidar techniques to investigate several
other metrics for studying archeological site stability, including monitoring cultural structures and artifacts and remotely
measuring cryptobiotic soil crust areas.
Our topographic change results indicate that 9 of 10
survey areas showed signs of either erosion, deposition,
or both during the 2007–2010 time interval and that these
changes can be linked to a variety of geomorphic processes,
primarily overland flow gullying and aeolian sand transport.
In several cases, large (>50 cm) vertical change occurred,
and in one case, more than 100 m3 of sediment was eroded.
Further, for all sites monitored throughout the river corridor during this time period, the overall signal was related
to erosion rather than deposition. These results highlight
the potential for rapid archeological site change in Grand
Canyon. Whereas the topographic change results presented
herein provide the highest level of change detection yet
performed on entire archeological sites in Grand Canyon,
additional work in combining these results with site-specific
weather, hydrology, and geomorphology data is needed to
provide a more thorough understanding of the causes of the
documented topographic changes. Linking lidar-derived
measurements of topographic changes with these other data
sources should provide land managers with a scientific basis
for making management decisions regarding archeological resources in Grand Canyon National Park and assist
in answering open questions regarding the influence that
sediment-depleted flows from Glen Canyon Dam have on
archeological site stability.

Introduction
Human occupation in Grand Canyon, Arizona, dates
from at least 11,000 years before present to the modern era
(Fairley, 2005). For most of this period, the only evidence
of human occupation in this iconic landscape is provided
by archeological sites. Because these sites contain valuable
information about the past and serve as tangible evidence of
Native Americans’ prehistoric use of this area, topographic

change and potential degradation of archeological sites
within the Colorado River corridor of Grand Canyon
National Park (GCNP) (fig. 1), located below Glen Canyon Dam, is a subject of considerable interest and concern
to park managers, Native Americans, scientists, and other
members of the American public who value these historic
places. In 1997, the United States Secretary of the Interior
established the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management
Program (GCDAMP) to research and mitigate potential negative impacts of Glen Canyon Dam on downstream resources,
including archeological sites, fish, wildlife, recreational values, and power-generation interests (see, for example, Gloss
and others, 2005). One aspect of this management program
aims to determine whether controlled releases from Glen
Canyon Dam are affecting rates of archeological site erosion
and the preservation of archeological resources (for example,
Yeatts, 1996). Many archeological sites are located within or
adjacent to the historical river flood zone. Because the dam
prevents sediment from moving downstream and only 15 percent of the pre-dam sediment supply is contributed by tributaries below Glen Canyon Dam, and additionally because
the dam severely restricts the magnitude and duration of
flood flows (Topping and others 2003), pre-dam flood zones
are no longer scoured or replenished by sediment-enriched
floods. This has resulted in a reduction in the size, volume,
and distributions of sand bars that might contribute sand to
nearby archeological sites through aeolian transport. It has
been hypothesized that a reduction in open sand area in river
sand bars has resulted in a reduction in aeolian sand cover at
archeological sites and that this has resulted in an increase
in surface runoff and a consequent increase in the rate of
site erosion via precipitation-induced surface water gullying
(Hereford and others, 1991, 1993; Thompson and Potochnik, 2000; Draut and Rubin, 2008; fig. 2). Although longterm topographic change resulting from a variety of natural
processes is typical in high-relief, semiarid landscapes such
as the Grand Canyon region, continued erosion of archeological sites threatens both the archeological resources and
our future ability to study evidence of past human habitation
(fig. 3). Thus, determining the rates of topographic change and
the potential causes contributing to site degradation continues
to be a priority for the GCDAMP and the National Park Service
(Leap and others, 1996, 1997, 2000).
The monitoring of topographic change at archeological
sites in Grand Canyon has undergone considerable advances
during the past 20 years. Beginning with qualitative repeat
oblique photography and quantitative total station surveys
(Leap and others, 2000) and through to modern use of digital
photogrammetry (Pederson and others, 2006) and lidar techniques (Collins and others, 2008, 2009), topographic surveys
have become more accurate and applicable to larger areas.
Currently, terrestrial lidar techniques are at the forefront of
high-accuracy surveys, and their applicability and utility
have been clearly demonstrated by previous survey efforts
in Grand Canyon (for example, Collins and others, 2009), as

well as encouraged by an independent review panel (Kintigh
and others, 2007). High-resolution, highly accurate (centimeter-level) surveys have been found to be necessary to
track small-scale topographic changes that can act as indicators of future response because these are often the scales
at which existing geomorphological processes occur (for
example, aeolian sand transport, overland flow, and gullying). Further, the ability to collect data over a wide area (as
opposed to more focused surveys such as total station thalweg surveys) makes it possible to put overall processes into
context and ensures that important changes are not missed
during data collection. For example, previous results (Collins
and others, 2008, 2009) have shown that, whereas focused
thalweg surveys can correctly identify the approximate
magnitude of change, they cannot always confirm the overall
cause of the change, which might, for example, be from
areas outside the thalweg line where lidar surveys also collect data. As a result of these studies and clear contributions
to understanding archeological site change, the Sociocultural
Program of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Grand Canyon
Monitoring and Research Center (GCMRC) has pursued
evaluating the applicability of terrestrial lidar for monitoring entire archeological site areas for topographic change in
order to address the stated concerns of the GCDAMP (see,
for example, Fairley and others, 2007). A series of reports
have been published, detailing first the applicability of
using terrestrial lidar in GCNP for monitoring a variety of
resources (Collins and Kayen, 2006) and then specifically
using terrestrial lidar for archeological site monitoring (Collins and others, 2008, 2009).
In Collins and others (2009), results using what was
then a state-of-the-art terrestrial-lidar laser scanning device
were presented. Since then, new advances in technology have resulted in laser scanning devices with much
greater accuracy and more sophisticated software, with an
improved potential to measure small-scale (centimeterlevel) topographic change. This report presents the results
of topographic surveys performed in GCNP between 2007
and 2010, using first a combination of the “old” and “new”
technology, followed by surveys using only the newest
technology. It follows much the same format as an earlier
report (Collins and others, 2009) and builds upon the results
reported therein.
In all cases, the focus of this report is on change detection, with the goal of detecting topographic and archeological
site change at the highest resolution possible. In addition to
monitoring the sites described in previous reports, we include
four new sites, each with a different topographic and archeological signature (for example, a site with artifacts scattered
over an active dune slope and a habitation site with masonry
walls). We also present several analyses aimed at pushing the
latest technology forward so that its use for monitoring both
archeology and geomorphology can reach its highest potential. These include using terrestrial lidar for monitoring change
to cultural structures, for delineating cryptobiotic crust areas,

Methods
and for establishing point density guidelines for various forms
of change detection (that is, overall topographic site change
versus smaller scale geomorphologic change).
As with the previously referenced reports (Collins and others, 2008, 2009), we present a detailed description of terrestrial
lidar methods and associated error analyses, because the technology is still somewhat new and few error analyses for terrestrial
lidar exist in the literature. We also provide detailed descriptions
of each of the survey areas for which data are presented. Finally,
whereas high-resolution data and geomorphologic signatures are
presented for a variety of sites that show both erosion and deposition during the monitoring period (2007–2010), in this report
we do not attempt to link these changes to operations of Glen
Canyon Dam. Instead, as in previous reports, we present highquality topographic change detection data, with the intention that
these data will be used for future dam- and river-process related
and predictive modeling studies.

Methods
Field Logistics
Building upon three existing datasets (Collins and others, 2009) covering the topographic change detected between
2006 and 2007 at a total of 9 archeological sites (10 separate
survey areas; table 1, fig. 1), we conducted two additional data
collection efforts in Grand Canyon National Park in 2010. The
current research effort uses the last 2007 survey (September
2007) as the initial baseline survey, which is compared to the
two datasets collected in 2010 (April 2010 and September
2010). For simplicity, we refer to the efforts whose results
are presented herein as the September 2007, April 2010, and
September 2010 surveys. In April 2010, only sites in the upper
half of Grand Canyon (above Phantom Ranch) were surveyed,

National Park. This site was previously buried by aeolian and
alluvial sediments and emerged as precipitation runoff and wind
deflation exposed habitation features.

whereas in September 2010 sites both above and below Phantom Ranch were surveyed. The 2010 field efforts included
data collection at 8 of the 10 areas previously surveyed in
2006–2007, including one site previously surveyed in 2007
but with no previous change detection analysis performed. In
addition, we collected data at three new sites not previously
surveyed (table 1). Two sites originally surveyed in 2006 and
2007 (AZ:G:03:0041 and AZ:G:03:0002) were not surveyed in
2010 because of logistical constraints on the surveying effort.
The sites selected for surveying encompassed a variety of
archeological site types. These include some where erosion has
been previously identified as having an impact on site resources
and others where relatively little previous erosion has been
documented. To protect the sensitive nature of the sites, specific site location information is omitted from this report, and
the GCNP archeological site identification number is used for
reference (table 1). At each site, data collection was focused on
the terrain surrounding one or more gully systems; these gully
systems are referred to in this report as G1, G2, and so on, and
numbered sequentially moving from upstream to downstream
along the river corridor or the adjacent side drainage.
Each survey effort was supported by two GCMRC
motor rafts carrying all personnel and equipment for trips

lasting from 10 to 18 days. Equipment consisted of camping gear and food supplies, a battery charging system for all
electronics, and survey equipment, including a terrestrial
lidar laser scanner, a total station unit, a pair of survey-grade
differential GPS receivers, and associated control point
reflectors and tripods. Personnel consisted of researchers
from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park,
California, and researchers and staff from the GCMRC
in Flagstaff, Arizona. In April 2010, a contract surveyor
(Brian Fisher of Geodetic Analysis, LLC, Phoenix, Arizona)
accompanied the trip to perform survey coordinate data
collection. Raft pilots (boatmen) contracted through Humphrey Summit Support Inc., supervised the travel and camp
logistics for each trip.

Lidar Data Collection
High-resolution topographic data from each archeological site were collected using the newest generation of terrestrial (ground-based) lidar surveying laser scanners. Terrestrial lidar sends and receives laser pulses along exactly
known trajectories to build a point file of three-dimensional

(3-D) coordinates of virtually any reflecting surface. The
points are then viewed in 3-D software so that data filtering,
surface building, and change detection can be performed.
The technology is relatively new (10+ years) and continues
to evolve rapidly. Whereas a Riegl Z210 laser scanner was
used in previous studies (Collins and others, 2009), including for the change detection analysis of the 2007 dataset
presented herein, the present study (2010 datasets) used
a Riegl Z420i laser scanner as a tripod-mounted survey
instrument (fig. 4). We present detailed error analyses in a
later section of this report to account for differences in the
hardware and software used between these surveys. The
Riegl Z420i uses a Class 1 (eye safe under normal operating conditions), near-infrared, pulsed laser diode with a
beam divergence of 0.014° (approximately 25 mm at 100-m
range). Typical maximum range for natural targets with 10
percent and 80 percent reflectivity is 350 m and 1,000 m,
respectively, with 10-mm accuracy at 50-m range. Using
12-volt, sealed, gel-cell, lead-acid batteries, the laser system
consumes relatively low power (typically 78 W).
Most laser scanners operate using some combination of
precisely aligned rotating polygonal mirrors and extremely
small stepping motors to guide the laser paths over the area
of interest. With the Riegl Z420i, laser pulses are reflected

from a triangular mirror rotating around the horizontal axis
(with minimum angle step width of 0.004°), while the entire
head of the scanner pans around the vertical axis of the
laser diode origin (also with minimum angle step width of
0.004°). The technology, specifically developed for rapid
topographic surveys, allows data to be collected at rates of
thousands of points per second, generating a “point cloud”
of 3-D coordinates. Acquisition of sufficiently dense point
clouds (that is, point-to-point spacing on the order of 5 cm
or less) can, in most cases, fully describe site topography.
The point files from data collection are transformed into 3-D
surfaces for cross-section and volumetric analyses.
We followed an essentially identical set of surveying protocols as in previous field efforts. At each survey
location, we used an elevated tripod (up to 2.6 m tall) to
position the laser above each site to capture a wide range
and more direct line of sight to the area topography (fig. 4).
We collected multiple scans from different locations during
each survey to fill in “shadow zones” of areas not directly
in the line of sight of the laser and to expand the range and
density of the point data. Data with the Riegl Z420i were
collected at a rate of 8,000 points per second using a single,
last return for each point. Each scan typically collected data
over a 360° range in the horizontal direction (aimed at the

6

Topographic Change Detection at Select Archeological Sites in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 2007–2010

region of interest) and over a range of ±40° (measured from
the horizontal) in the vertical direction. This provided approximately 4,000,000 to 8,000,000 points for each scan, although
only a portion (about 50 percent) of those were located within
the site area of interest. One additional survey protocol implemented in 2010 was the attempt to locate the laser instrument
outside of the archeological site boundaries as much as possible.
This was done to minimize additional site disturbance, but also
resulted in lower point density in some cases, in particular for
narrow gullies located at oblique angles to the laser instrument
locations. When this occurred and affected the development of
a robust surface model, it is further discussed within the context
of each site’s results.
Combining point-cloud data from multiple scan locations
into a single georeferenced model continues to be the most challenging and error-producing component of terrestrial lidar scanning. Although many methods exist, the most accurate methods
rely on the collection of georeferenced survey points on either
the laser itself, a network of visible reflectors within the scans,
or both. At each site, we collected high-accuracy survey control
on all scanner origins and a network of six control targets visible to the laser during data collection using either or both of a
Topcon total station survey device and a pair of survey-grade,
real-time kinematic differential Topcon Hiper+ GPS receivers. Coordinates were determined by locating the instrument
over known survey benchmarks or by collecting total station
or Global Positioning System (GPS) positions on the laser and
target locations. Nearly all laser and control point locations represent transient locations between temporally consecutive datasets. Permanent monuments for each of these points (with the
exception of total station and GPS base station locations) could
not be constructed because of the sensitive and wilderness environment of these sites, and instead we rely on the high-accuracy
survey data for georeferencing the point clouds. Processed coordinates were provided by survey personnel following each trip
and their quality assessed within the scan-alignment registration
procedures outlined in the following sections. Overall accuracy,
measured relative to fixed benchmarks at each site and averaged
for both survey techniques, was 1.2 cm horizontal and 2.5 cm
vertical at the 95-percent confidence level (see the “Error Analysis” section for additional details). We note that the root mean
square (RMS) survey control error represents a relative level of
horizontal and vertical control in georeferenced space, because
the control-point benchmarks used in the survey are only known
to a three-dimensional accuracy of 5 cm to 8 cm (Grand Canyon
Monitoring and Research Center, 2008). However, because
identical benchmarks were used throughout the study (that is,
total station and GPS base stations were always set up on the
identical fixed points during repeat surveys), this component of
error is not included in the subsequently outlined error analysis.

Data Processing
We processed the lidar data through an integrated
suite of registration, georeferencing, filtering, and

surface-model-generation techniques specific to terrestrial
lidar data. Our methodology follows much the same framework as previously reported in Collins and others (2009),
but it has been updated to reflect advances in data collection,
processing, and change detection analysis. These advances
include more rigorous and accurate registration techniques
using Riegl RiScan Pro v.1.4.3 software (http://www.riegl.
com/products/software-packages/riscan-pro/), surface modeling based on point-density proxies in I-SiTE Studio v. 3.4
software (http://www.maptek.com/products/i-site/i-site_studio.html), and more accurate change detection thresholding
using ArcGIS v. 9 (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/).
The processing methodology for data collected in 2010
consists of an integrated workflow that ensures data quality
and accuracy, particularly with respect to change detection.
This workflow is described here with the appropriate software package shown in brackets. Note that the workflow for
processing the September 2007 datasets as outlined in Collins
and others (2009) is slightly different but is not repeated here.

1.

Raw Data Archiving—The data are archived in raw field
format to preserve a backup copy. [Riegl RiScan Pro]

2.

Survey Data Processing—The survey data provided by
total station or GPS are processed to determine accurate
coordinates for the scanner and reflector center heights
and to eliminate common field errors such as miscalculated tripod or antenna heights.

3.

Registration—Data from individual scan locations are
combined together within a local coordinate system based
on the best-fit alignment of control points scanned in the
field. This is preliminarily performed in the field and then
recalculated in the office to ensure data consistency and
accuracy. [Riegl RiScan Pro]

4.

Georeferencing—Local coordinate locations of control
points and laser setup locations are aligned with their
respective geographic coordinates from Step 2 using a
best-fit error minimization algorithm. The target accuracy
is typically better than 1.5 cm. [Riegl RiScan Pro]

5.

Quality Control Check—Registered, georeferenced point
clouds are first visually checked for data misfits within
each site’s point clouds and then checked for overall
close alignment with previous datasets using histogram
cumulative frequency analysis. [I-SiTE Studio]

6.

Preliminary Scan Filtering—Extraneous points that
define such items as people, equipment, dust, or birds
are removed from the raw scan files using both manual
filtering and maximum point separation distances (that
is, all points more than 50 cm from all other points are
removed). Distant points outside the overall study area
are also removed using a polygon filter. [I-SiTE Studio]

control points shown in mid-ground.

8.

Topographic Filtering—Points representing anything
other than the ground surface are removed from each scan
using a sequence of topographic filtering steps. Following a rough, manual removal of tall vegetation points, the
lowest point within each 50-cm-square grid cell is identified and a surface (triangulated irregular network, TIN) is
constructed from these points. All points vertically within
10 cm of this surface are then identified. Finally, the lowest point within each 5-cm-square grid cell of these 10-cm
surface proximity points is selected. These steps generally
achieve a well-refined, high-resolution ground point data
file, although additional manual manipulation of the data
is always required for particularly small and large vegetation. [I-SiTE Studio]
TIN Surface Model Generation—The final surface model
is created using a new TIN created from the point set that
results from Step 7. Minor filtering of the TIN is sometimes needed to remove obvious remaining extraneous
high points from tall vegetation. In some cases, difficulties in the manual filtering of larger vegetation may
lead to inconsistencies in the final surface models—for
example, when a large boulder is mistaken as a similarsized bush or tree. [I-SiTE Studio]

9.

Grid Digital Elevation Model Generation—Although
TINs are generally preferred for high-resolution surface
modeling of complex topography and especially for areas
with steep or overhanging geometry, digital elevation
model (DEM) raster grids offer several advantages with
respect to change detection analysis and plotting. Therefore our processing includes grid creation with a 5-cm
cell size, using the natural neighbor TIN to raster method.
[ArcGIS]

Surface Model Comparison
For each site, three surface models were created where
applicable—one each for the September 2007, April 2010, and
September 2010 field efforts. We methodically analyzed the
surface models by comparing temporally sequential datasets
with one another (for example, September 2007 to April 2010,
April 2010 to September 2010, and so forth), thereby allowing site changes to be compared over time. Given the relatively long period of time for some comparisons (as much as
three years, from September 2007 to September 2010, in the
case of sites AZ:B:10:0225 and AZ:G:03:0072), it is possible
that cycles of erosion and deposition may have occurred that

8

cannot be identified from the data. Regardless, the comparisons still provide definitive results for the time period in which
monitoring occurred.
Two types of surface change maps were used to detect
vertical change—a three-dimensional TIN surface change
map and a two-dimensional grid of the surface change. The
three-dimensional surface change map was constructed by
differencing the more recent surface with the previous TIN
surface, thereby producing an elevation change map. In the
results, we report the number of points used in the construction of each TIN surface as an indication of the relative
model point density—the actual number of points collected
is typically an order of magnitude greater and indicates that
the majority of the points are generally removed during vegetation filtering and surface creation, as previously described.
We used these results only as a preliminary map for detecting
change because the TIN-generation process typically fills in
areas where little to no data existed (connecting areas of low
point density with large facets than cannot adequately model
the fine-scale site topography). Thus, these results can only
be used accurately where change can be positively identified
on the basis of sufficient point density.
To perform surface-model change detection using a
uniform point density representative of the true topographic
surface, we applied a point-density-based masking algorithm to each surface model DEM. The ArcGIS-based suite
of algorithms (fig. 5) applied a filtering mask to the point
data such that grid cells with insufficient point density for
performing realistic change detection (here, selected as less
than 6 points per 25 cm by 25 cm grid cell or equivalent to
96 points per m2) were removed from the surface. Vertical
change on the remaining grid cells was then analyzed and the
resulting change detection DEM was displayed with warm
colors (reds, oranges, yellows) representing surface lowering (erosion) and cool colors (blues, greens) representing
surface heightening (deposition). Vertical change detection
thresholds used to create the color maps were based on error
analyses performed on each dataset and are described in
subsequent sections of this report (see “Error Analysis”). For
each survey area, we use the resulting colored grid maps as
the representation of the change that occurred during each
monitoring period.
For presentation purposes, the change maps are overlaid
on a DEM hillshade map (colored with shades of gray—see
“Results” section) constructed of the initial bare-ground model
for each site. In some cases, these maps may include areas
where no change detection was performed because of insufficient point density (that is, less than 96 points per m2). These
areas are generally small (<1 m2) and represent isolated pockets
of vegetation and shadows behind objects such as shrubs or
boulders. In some cases, these areas can be identified in the
hillshade DEMs by “smooth” areas of the DEM, but they
should not be confused with areas outside the survey boundaries where the point density was much too low (< 10 points per
m2) to attempt detailed topographic surface construction.

When change was detected, we performed quantitative
geometric and qualitative process assessments to determine
the extent and likely causes of the change. If no change was
detected, no additional analysis was performed. To describe
detected changes, we use the generalized terms “erosion”
and “deposition” to indicate surface lowering and surface
rising, respectively. Thus, these may, at times, capture
processes, such as visitor-induced surface compaction, that
are technically neither erosional nor depositional processes.
When a more specific geomorphic process could potentially
be related, such as soil creep, we identified this within the
results for each site. We used a combination of DEM color
change maps, TIN surfaces, cross-sections, and photographs
to derive the two-dimensional areal extent of the change, the
overall change statistics (means, standard deviations, and
maximums), and the volumes of sediment mobilized either
into or out of the site. In all cases, we verified changes using
either prechange and postchange photographs or additional
detailed analysis of the point cloud alignment; when change
could not be verified using either or both of these methods,
the change was not reported.

Error Analysis
Terrestrial lidar data, similarly to any other survey data,
are subject to errors originating from both the data collection and postprocessing methodologies. We include a detailed
analysis of the errors associated with the data to allow the
objective presentation of limitations in detecting topographic
change. Because the datasets presented here (April 2010 and
September 2010) were collected differently from those used
for comparing and calculating change detection results (September 2007), we present a summary of error analyses for both
datasets, as well as the resulting change detection analysis
error for comparisons between the datasets.
Two types of analysis are presented: deterministic and
empirical. These are then combined into a hybrid error analysis used to define the error bounds of the results. Deterministic error analysis was performed for all datasets previously
presented (May 2006, May 2007, September 2007; Collins
and other, 2009) and is generally more conservative (that
is, overestimates actual errors). It is calculated by assuming
that the average or maximum possible errors occurred (for
example, that the average or maximum laser instrument error
is inherent in every data point) and that each component of
error is independent from all others (that is, errors are only
additive). Empirical error analysis is not generally conservative, but it is typically more accurate. Here, empirical errors
are determined by comparison of selected subsections of data
with their known locations. The errors determined from this
comparison are then assumed to represent the error inherent
in the entire dataset. As long as a spatially valid subset of
data is used in the empirical determination, the resulting error
analysis is generally valid throughout the dataset. Although
either of the error analysis methods can be used depending

Figure 5. Schematic flow chart showing digital elevation model (DEM) processing steps for point density masking and
DEM comparison. Point datasets are initially converted to triangulated irregular networks (TINs) and then DEMs through
filtering and surface building routines. Subroutines check that minimum point density thresholds are met and the final
change detection DEM is performed on only those areas that meet the minimum point density specification.

on the desired degree of conservatism, we adopt a hybrid
approach that uses the results of both analyses, coupled with
the inclusion of a surface-building-and-gridding error term
that provides a final indication of the confidence in the change
detected and reported in the results.

Deterministic Error Analysis
Because the 2007 and 2010 datasets used different laser
instruments and consequently different registration procedures, two descriptions of deterministic error analysis are
presented. The September 2007 deterministic error analysis
follows that presented in Collins and others (2009) and is
summarized here. Errors for this dataset originated from three
sources: (1) positioning and georeferencing the laser scanner
and control points (Esurvey), (2) the laser instrument (Elaser), and
(3) the local coordinate registration process (Ereg). Because
two registration procedures were used to constrain all six
degrees of freedom (DOF) for these datasets (three translation
DOFs constrained by fixed scanner locations which do not
require registration, a single registration for two rotation DOFs
constrained by simultaneous rotation between two scan positions, and the final registration by an additional rotation DOF
constrained by simultaneous rotation of a third scan position
with the previous two—see Collins and others, 2009), Ereg was
included twice in the overall error analysis. The resulting four
error terms are assumed to be independent of one another such
that the total error (Etotal) is:

Etotal

2

( 2007 )

2

2

= E survey + Elaser + E reg1 + E reg 2

2

(1)

Note that each of these error terms is presented only
for the vertical component, consistent with how topographic
change detection maps are typically presented. The result of
equation 1 for the September 2007 data was determined to be
41.8 mm, or approximately 4 cm (Collins and others, 2009).
We note that no absolute georeferencing error relative to
real-world coordinates is included in this or any other error
estimate because the same, identical survey reference benchmarks were used for all surveys (including those performed
in 2010). Therefore, in calculating differences between the
datasets, any additional benchmark-related error (typically
between 5 cm and 8 cm positional accuracy; Grand Canyon
Monitoring and Research Center, 2008) can be ignored as
long as maximum benchmark stability and minimal differential tectonic movement between benchmarks and site areas
can be assumed. Similarly to previous research (Collins and
others, 2009), we judge that these are both valid for shortduration surveys in Grand Canyon.
Following a similar methodology as equation 1, we
computed the vertical error from the 2010 datasets. We determined the mean georeferencing error (Esurvey) by averaging
the 95-percent confidence level error bound for 113 vertical
measurements in which we recorded duplicate (redundant) survey coordinates (that is, completely independent total station
and (or) GPS measurements). These included laser instrument
locations, control point locations, and survey benchmarks at
each site. The result was a mean vertical georeferencing error
(Esurvey) of 24.7 mm. We judge this to be a conservative estimate
because two standard deviations (2σ = 95-percent confidence
interval assuming normally distributed data) make up the error

10

Topographic Change Detection at Select Archeological Sites in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 2007–2010

bounds and multiple technologies (GPS and total station) were
sometimes used to obtain redundant observations.
For calculating the vertical component of error in the
laser beam for the instrument used in this study (Riegl Z420i),
we use the average results of an absolute accuracy calculation
(11.2 mm) calculated at 50-m range by Lichti and Jamtsho
(2006), which accounts for both laser beam divergence and
angular resolution, and a fixed object calibration test (1.7 mm)
conducted at between 15-m and 60-m range on precisely translated objects by Boehler and others (2003). The average result
for Elaser is 6.5 mm.
We calculated registration errors by averaging the control
point and laser location RMS error for each site in April 2010
and September 2010. The algorithm determines the best threedimensional orientation of the datasets based on a comparison
of finely scanned control points visible in adjacent scans.
Approximately 10 surveyed points were collected at each of
the 11 sites, yielding a total of 186 surveyed points and resulting in an overall average three-dimensional error (3–D error)
of 13 mm for each site. Calculating the vertical component
of registration error requires an assumption that the error is
evenly distributed between the x, y, and z directions (that is,
the 3–D error/√3; a valid assumption for this dataset), such
that the average vertical registration error (Ereg) is 7.5 mm.
Following the methodology presented for the 2007
dataset in equation 1, and noting that only one measure of
registration error is needed for the 2010 data because of the
different registration procedure (control point registration
versus multiple scan rotation registration—see “Data
Processing” section and Collins and others, 2009), the
resulting equation is:

Etotal

2

( 2010 )

2

= E survey + Elaser + E reg

2

(2)

Using the presented values for the data collected in 2010
yields a total vertical error of 26.6 mm, or approximately
3 cm. Assuming that errors generated by either the 2007 or
2010 datasets are independent of one another (a conservative
assumption because some errors such as those from the laser
are likely not independent between datasets), the absolute
errors between surface data can be computed by summing
each component (whether from 2007 or 2010). Thus, for
comparison of September 2007 data to either April 2010 or
September 2010 data, the absolute vertical error is 7 cm (4 cm
from 2007 and 3 cm from 2010). Similarly, for comparison of
April 2010 data to September 2010 data, the absolute vertical
error is 6 cm (3 cm each from each of the two 2010 datasets).

Empirical Error Analysis
Our empirical error analysis uses direct point-to-point
comparisons of objects at each survey area that are “fixed”
(that is, immobile) and visible within the point cloud data. We

compare their absolute positions between temporally consecutive scan datasets using all point clouds from each dataset.
Rocks between 25 cm and 2 m in diameter (for example, R1
through R10—see fig. 6) were the primary objects judged
to be immobile for the purposes of this analysis, although
large tree-trunks were used in some cases where rocks were
not plentiful. Analysis consisted of isolating the points that
describe a particular rock feature from each temporally different dataset and computing two sets of distance metrics to
compare the relative errors between the point objects. The
first distance metric compares the three-dimensional closest
vectors between all points for each dataset (that is, each vector
describing the distance between two points—one in each temporally different dataset). The second metric uses an iterative
closest point (ICP) algorithm to solve for the preregistration
and postregistration best fit of the points between datasets and
again calculates the vector difference between the two sets of
points. Using this algorithm, the preregistration solution provides an indication of the relative distances between the points
with respect to the initial configuration of the points (but only
uses the “best” fitting points rather than all points, as the first
distance metric describes). Here, the postregistration results
are not used because they are not representative of the registration process between the full datasets.
The calculated error statistics (tables 2 and 3) could
technically be deconvoluted from a three-dimensional value
to x, y, and z directions as previously shown and performed.
However, because the objects and points selected (that is,
the upper surfaces of rocks in most cases) are predominantly
aligned with the z (up) direction, we use the statistics as direct
estimates of the error associated with the vertical direction of
change. We chose to compare only a single metric for determination of the change detection error thresholds and used
the mean vector distance between points (first metric) rather
than the mean pre-ICP point metric (second metric). This is
a slightly conservative, but also more representative metric
because it computes distances between all points in each
analysis.
The results indicate that the mean error and standard
deviation were 2.2 cm and 1.2 cm, respectively, for the comparison of the September 2007 and April 2010 datasets and 1.5
cm and 0.6 cm, respectively, for the comparison of the April
2010 and September 2010 datasets (tables 2 and 3). Assuming normally distributed errors (a valid assumption for these
data—see fig. 6 with errors centered about the mean difference), the maximum empirical errors at two standard deviations (95-percent confidence interval) are 4.6 cm and 2.7 cm
for the September 2007-April 2010 and April 2010-September
2010 datasets, respectively. Note that these error thresholds
represent the vertical error between datasets directly, such that
doubling the errors is not necessary for obtaining a change
detection threshold estimate. The results are somewhat less
than the deterministic and more conservative error analysis,
which is expected. They represent the best analytical estimate
of errors between consecutively scanned datasets.

of differences between point clouds collected in April 2010 and September 2010 for one rock (R2) of the 10 shown in A. In most
cases, only the upper surface of the objects could be described and compared, thereby providing a direct estimate of the
vertical error.

Final Hybrid Error Analysis
Although both error analyses (deterministic and empirical)
can be used to bracket the degree of change detection possible
for the datasets, a final error analysis was performed by integrating the two analyses and coupling these with an additional
error term to take into account the error associated with model
building and grid calculation. Calculation of surface models
can technically introduce additional error through interpolation
of the point cloud to build the continuous surface required for
performing large-scale change detection. This error is primarily
dependent on the data density (point spacing) used in surface
generation and the relative change in slope (actual surface
roughness) between data points. In addition, it can be influenced
by artifacts in the point cloud data (for example, small-scale
vegetation such as grasses) that may not have been removed
during filtering. The effect of these features is an abnormally
rough surface that is not necessarily representative of the true
ground conditions, such that the small-scale surface features
dominate the apparent change. To account for these errors, we
used the empirical error analyses previously described and
visually adjusted them in the direction of the deterministic
analysis results until the selected error threshold included the
majority of the small-scale perturbations (that is, all small-scale
perturbations could be positively identified with vegetation or
TIN surface roughness rather than actual change, as determined
by close comparison between point clouds, TIN models, and
site photos). Essentially, this hybrid approach provides a more
tractable change detection analysis result when comparing time
series surfaces from the datasets.
Whereas the hybrid error analysis results varied between
survey areas depending on the modeled surface perturbations
(for example, resulting from variations in low-level vegetation at
each survey area), for the sake of simplicity we adopted a single
conservative change detection error threshold for each temporal
set of datasets. The final hybrid error change detection thresholds
were determined to be 5 cm and 3 cm for comparisons between
September 2007 and April 2010, and April 2010 and September
2010 datasets, respectively. The surface perturbations discussed

13

previously are therefore below this threshold. These thresholds
are nearly identical to the 95-percent confidence level results
using the empirical error analysis results and are used for all
survey area change detection results presented in this report.
They indicate what portion of the data realistically changed with
respect to all known and potential errors—changes smaller than
these limits are assumed to be unreliable with respect to determining topographic change. Whereas real topographic changes
below these thresholds may have occurred, they are below the
level of error detection and are therefore not reported.

Results
The results for 10 of the 11 survey areas are presented
here. The additional site (AZ:C:13:0009) was monitored
only for changes to structural walls rather than topography;
results are reported in the “Monitoring Archeological
Structure Stability” section. In the following subsections,
brief descriptions of the topography, geomorphology,
hydrology, archeology, and general vegetation ecology for
each of the 10 topographically monitored areas are provided.
Pederson and others (2003), Draut and others (2005), and
Collins and others (2009) provide additional details about
some of these areas. Base maps for site presentation were
developed from the USGS GCMRC Internet Map Server
(U.S. Geological Survey, 2008). However, to protect the
sites, the maps do not contain georeferenced identifiable
features. Change detection results highlight areas of
significant erosion and deposition measured between
the three surface models of the 2007–2010 datasets. As
a reference, table 4 provides a summary of the number
of scan locations and measured areas where data were
collected, along with the area and number of points used in
the creation of each surface model for the presented results.
The collected and modeled surface areas are different in size
because of the lack of overlap between some of the datasets
and the difficulty with accurately analyzing change at the
boundaries of the site area or in areas of dense vegetation.

This site was monitored only for changes to structural walls within the site; results are reported in a separate section.

Site AZ:C:05:0031
Site AZ:C:05:0031 was not investigated by previous
lidar surveys; the current surveys (April and September
2010) present the first opportunity for detailed change
detection analysis. The site is archeologically important as
an ancestral Puebloan camp site dating to the 11th or early
12th century and contains evidence of roasting features,
pottery sherds, stone tool-making debris, and low stackedstone walls (Fairley and others, 1994). The site is located
immediately below a steep outcrop of Redwall Limestone.
Aeolian dune sands ramp from the Colorado River up to the
base of the outcrop, and the site itself is primarily located
on these dune sands. A prominent gully (G1) bounds the
site and the majority of the dune field to the south. The site
is covered mostly by sand, but large (1 to 2 m diameter)
boulders and isolated vegetation cover portions of the site.
Vegetation includes clusters of prickly pear cactus (Opuntia
sp. including beavertail cactus, Opuntia basilaris), ephedra
(Ephedra sp.), dropseed grass (Sporobolus sp.), Indian rice

grass (Achnatherum hymenoides), asters (Asteraceae family), dicoria (Dicoria canescens), and nonnative Russian
thistle (Salsola tragus) (Draut, 2011). O’Brien and Pederson (2009a) identified gullying, aeolian transport, piping,
and creep as the geomorphic processes affecting this site
and noted that whereas aeolian transport and recent revegetation efforts have stabilized some parts of the site, some
archeological resources continue to be affected by creep
processes. Additional site details are included in O’Brien
and Pederson (2009a).
We performed change detection in the area of the archeological site below the Redwall outcrop and in six areas of dune
sand located between the outcrop and the Colorado River (figs.
7 and 8). The purpose of the dune-sand change detection was
to identify areas potentially subject to aeolian aggradation in
response to the building of a sand bar immediately upwind of
the dune area during a March 2008 high flow experiment (Hazel
and others, 2010). This is important to study because it has been
suggested that the creation of new sand bars during sedimentenriched high flows could potentially increase the amount of

aeolian sand transported towards archeological sites, thereby
helping to protect the archeological sites from further degradation (Draut and others, 2010a).
Surface comparison between the April 2010 and
September 2010 datasets indicates that four areas (ER1
through ER4) underwent erosion within or near the archeological site and four areas (ER5 through ER8) underwent
erosion in the adjacent dune-sand areas during this time

period (fig. 9, table 5). Aeolian processes were the likely
primary cause for these changes, as evidenced by the sand
ripples observed at the site and the generally small depths
and widespread areas in which change occurred. No areas
of deposition were identified, suggesting that the sand was
transported out of the general vicinity of the archeological
site, most likely either towards the river or northward to
another area of active dunes.

Site AZ:C:13:0006
Site AZ:C:13:0006 has been monitored by terrestrial
lidar five times since 2006. The site is an area of Puebloan
II (about A.D. 900 to 1100) habitation (Fairley and
others, 1994), and although there are no visible habitation
structures, the types and varieties of artifacts visible on
the site surface suggest that structures may be buried
beneath the dune sands in this area. A debris fan covered
by alluvium, colluvium, and aeolian dune sands forms the
majority of the site area and is bordered on one side by
Bright Angel Shale outcrops and on the other by the trunk
of a small (~5 m wide) tributary channel that drains directly
to the Colorado River (figs. 10 and 11). Three gullies (G1,
G2, G3) drain the relatively flat upper site and connect to
either the tributary channel (G1, G2) or a lower alluvial
terrace that borders the river’s edge (G3). Brush and rock
check dams were installed in each of these gullies in May
2006 (O’Brien and Pederson, 2009b). Vegetation consists
of a mix of bunch grasses and small cacti, chiefly prickly
pear (for example, Opuntia polyacantha var. erinacea),
with a few larger mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa var.
torreyana) located near the boundaries of the site. O’Brien
and Pederson (2009a) identified creep, aeolian transport,
overland flow, and rainsplash as the geomorphic processes
affecting this site and noted that some of these processes
are currently eroding artifacts. Additional site details are
included in O’Brien and Pederson (2009a,b).
Change detection analysis results for the first three
surveys spanning 2006–2007 are provided by Collins and
others (2009). Previously, wide-scale topographic changes
consisting of gully erosion and aeolian sand deposition and
subsequent erosion were detected here, and a net deposition
of sand between May 2006 and September 2007 near gully
G2 appeared to smooth the topographic profile at this
location (Collins and others, 2009). Overall aggradation
within the lower section of this gully was confirmed by
total station measurements made by O’Brien and Pederson
(2009b). Here, we provide change detection results between
September 2007 and the two 2010 datasets.
Surface comparison between September 2007 and
April 2010 indicates that change occurred in two areas of
the site—one located in a convex area of the lower slope
east of gully G2, and the other located in a similar setting
east of gully G1 (fig. 12). In neither case can the changes
be directly related to processes occurring within the
existing gullies at the site. Rather, the first (ER1 through
ER4) appears to be related to aeolian transport with minor
overland flow in an area previously identified as an active

19

dune slope, whereas the second (ER5 through ER11 and
DEP1 through DEP3) appears to be the result of overland
flow and soil creep processes in the steepest, convex part
of the site. The first erosion area coincides with a section
of the site that has undergone both aeolian deposition and
subsequent erosion linked to transport of sand from an
adjacent sand bar/dune area (Collins and others, 2009).
Although visual evidence of overland flow deposits located
in the tributary channel below this area constrains the end
location for some of the volume eroded, the whereabouts of
the aeolian sand removed from the site was not identified.
However, in April 2010, we observed very strong (40–50
km/h) wind move sand tens of meters into the air and
transport at least some sand to a dune slope on the opposite
(south) side of the tributary channel that demarcates the
south boundary of the site, suggesting that areas ER1
through ER4 may be losing sand to that location.
It is unclear why the second set of areas (ER5 through
ER11) was particularly subject to change—one possibility
is that the cryptobiotic crust was destabilized through slope
creep and (or) rainsplash processes. Tressler (2011) and
Tressler and Pederson (2010) identified creep as an active
process at a different area of this site, suggesting that creep
may have a significant role in erosion along the steep, convex
portions of the site. In addition, there is some visual evidence
for new, subtle, channelized flow in parts of this area, but not
within a well-formed gully. Whereas the depositional areas
can more than likely be linked to their erosion sources located
immediately adjacent to them, volumetric comparison of
erosion and deposition volumes indicates that a majority of
sediment was deposited in the tributary channel immediately
below these areas. The large magnitude (more than 10 cm)
of erosion (table 6) for some areas is thought to be due to
collapse in an oversteepened part of the slope and thus not
indicative of more typical erosion previously documented at
the site (Collins and others, 2009).
The only change detected between April 2010 and
September 2010 was in the active aeolian erosion areas
previously identified (ER1 through ER4; fig 13). Here,
slope-smoothing processes (most likely from continued
aeolian transport) caused subtle erosion to the topography.
When this minor amount of erosion is added to that
previously measured, and then compared to the volume of
sediment deposited in this location between May 2006 and
May 2007 (Collins and others, 2009), the overall erosion
volume between May 2007 and September 2010 (1.0
m3, table 6) is still considerably less than the amount of
deposition, so there has been a net depositional gain in this
area of the site between May 2006 and September 2010.

Site AZ:C:13:0336
Site AZ:C:13:0336 is located in the Palisades region of
Grand Canyon and has been monitored by terrestrial lidar
five times since 2006. The site consists of sparse artifacts
and fire-cracked rocks eroding from the face of a low-angle
terrace scarp (Fairley and others, 1994). A relatively flat area
of flood-deposited sediment immediately to the east of the
site is drained by several shallow gullies that spill over the
terrace scarp onto a lower fluvial terrace mantled by aeolian
sand (figs. 14 and 15). Check dams of brush and rock were
installed within the main gully (gully G2) at the site in 2007
to prevent ongoing erosion (O’Brien and Pederson, 2009a,b)
Vegetation consists of irregularly spaced grasses, shrubs, and
prickly pear cacti (for example, Opuntia polyacantha var.
erinacea) in the flatter upper portion of the site and mesquite
trees (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana) several meters in
height located at the edges of the site. These trees are a major
control on stabilization of coppice dunes that border the site.
O’Brien and Pederson (2009a) identified gullying, rilling,
creep, overland flow, and aeolian transport as the geomorphic
processes affecting this site and noted that creep processes
were incrementally eroding artifacts here. Additional site
details are included in O’Brien and Pederson (2009a,b).
Change detection analysis results for the first three
surveys spanning 2006–2007 for this site are provided by
Collins and others (2009). Previously, one area of deposition
was identified behind a small brush check dam within a shallow gully (G2—figs. 14 and 15) that bisects the site. This was
confirmed by total station measurements made by O’Brien
and Pederson (2009b), who measured overall thalweg
aggradation during the same period (May 2006 to September
2007). Here, we provide change detection results between
September 2007 and the two 2010 datasets.
Surface comparison between September 2007 and April
2010 indicates that 10 areas underwent erosion and 1 area
underwent deposition during this period (fig. 16, table 7). In
addition, deposition over an area of 2.2 m2 (labeled “DEP2?”
in fig. 16) was identified in the same area as that in which
previous deposition occurred during the 2006–2007 surveys
(Collins and others, 2009). However, as a result of the laser
instrument being located at an oblique angle to this area,
the data-point density for this small area was insufficient to
conclude that this deposition signal was real. It is therefore
not included in table 7, but it is highlighted in figure 16 with
the label “DEP2?” because of its importance with regard to
existing check dams located in this area.
The 10 identified erosion areas (fig. 16) are located
throughout the site and consist of a mix of unvegetated, opensand areas likely reworked by aeolian processes (for example,
ER1, ER2, ER3, ER8, ER10) and by channelized gully
processes (for example, ER6, ER7, ER9). Two areas (ER4,
ER5) could not be positively linked to a particular geomorphic process because of their close proximity to both aeolian

25

sand deposits and a channel thalweg terminus (near where
gully G1 and gully G2 meet). The areas likely associated
with channelized overland flow are particularly interesting,
especially ER9. Here, a new gully (G3), not very well formed
during the time of previous surveys (that is, 2006–2007;
Collins and others, 2009), now appears well developed and
actively eroding. Because the erosion is confined to the channel, the change mechanism is most likely channelized flow.
However, this area, along with ER10, is in close proximity to
informal hiking trails used by visitors, so an anthropogenic
contribution cannot be ruled out. The ER7 area within gully
G2 shows evidence that gully downcutting and channel wall
widening have occurred. This area is located above a series
of rock check dams (rcd, see fig. 15), suggesting that the
channel protection has either reached its capacity or is no
longer functioning properly (that is, flow may be circumventing the check dam). Site observations indicate that at least
some degree of infilling has occurred, but it is below the error
threshold for the presented lidar surveys during this time
period (5 cm). Finally, we observe that because no significant
volumes of sediment deposition were identified at any of the
gully termini within a larger area of alluvial sediments (well
landward of the river), the sediment contributed by gully
erosion must have been transported out of the surveyed site
boundaries, with the exception of the potential deposition
outlined by “DEP2?” in figure 16.
The one deposition area (DEP1) is located immediately
adjacent to the ER10 area that underwent aeolian erosion. Our
observations indicate that this area is also a product of aeolian
processes and, in fact, is composed of an almost identical
volume of sediment as was removed from ER10. This suggests that the ER10 and DEP1 areas are geomorphologically
linked through aeolian sand transport, although it is possible
that these features are linked to other areas of erosion and
deposition.
Between April 2010 and September 2010, we identified
10 areas of erosion and 1 area of deposition (fig. 17, table 7).
Many of these were located in areas of previous activity identified in the September 2007 to April 2010 comparison and
are likely linked to aeolian activity on unvegetated patches
of sand. Most pronounced was the erosion that occurred at
the September 2007 to April 2010 ER9 area, which continued
between April 2010 and September 2010 with an additional
4 cm of downcutting (ER7, table 7). Whereas overland flow
related transport out of the gully system likely occurred,
evidence of aeolian activity is also clearly evident from photo
comparison analysis. However, similarly to our previous conclusions for this site, an anthropogenic cause (that is, surface
disturbance by hikers) cannot be ruled out. The one deposition area (DEP1) furthers the case for active, ongoing aeolian
transport at this site; deposition on the order of 3 cm occurred
along an area bordering gully G3 and is most likely linked to
the aeolian erosion areas (ER6, ER8) immediately upgully to
the south and east.

Site AZ:C:13:0099
Site AZ:C:13:0099 in the Palisades region has been
monitored by terrestrial lidar five times since 2006. The site
is archeologically important because of the high density of
early-middle Pueblo II artifacts and habitation structures
found here, with evidence of a pre-Puebloan occupation
as well (Fairley and others, 1994). In addition, buried
structures and a variety of artifacts have been exposed by
gully sidewall erosion in recent years. The site is located
north of Site AZ:C:13:0336, in and around a deeply (>1 m)
incised gully system (figs. 18 and 19) that drains much of
this area and begins as a series of smaller shallow tributary
drainages to the east at the base of a steep talus slope. Rock
check dams have been used in the past to mitigate ongoing
erosion at several locations within this site. Vegetation
occurs throughout the site, including large (several meters
in canopy diameter) mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa
var. torreyana) and smaller shrubs and grasses. O’Brien and
Pederson (2009a) identified gullying, aeolian transport, and
piping as the geomorphic processes affecting this site and
noted that archeological resources were being destroyed by
gullying here. Additional site details are included in O’Brien
and Pederson (2009a)
Change detection analysis results for the first three
surveys spanning 2006–2007 for this site are provided
by Collins and others (2009). Previous surveys detected
deposition and erosion at this site related to aeolian and
gullying processes.
Because of the presence of ancestral Puebloan
structures and artifacts buried in the vicinity and the
imminent destruction of parts of the site by gullying erosion,
the site was excavated by the National Park Service and
Museum of Northern Arizona in spring 2008 to record and
document the archeological history of the site (Anderson
and Neff, 2011). Following these activities, the excavations
were backfilled and the site topography was restored as
close as possible to preexcavation site contours. Thus,
lidar-derived change detection at this site provides a means

31

to discriminate the preexcavation and postexcavation
topography and to determine if any other nonanthropogenic
changes occurred at the site during the April 2010 to
September 2010 time interval.
We identified at least 13 areas of erosion and 5 areas
of deposition between September 2007 and April 2010 (fig.
20, table 8). Most of these areas (for example, ER1, ER11,
DEP4) are known to have been modified by excavation
activities (Anderson and Neff, 2011); most areas of
erosion coincide with locations of excavation, and areas
of deposition are where backdirt from the excavation units
was piled and screened. Whereas some areas of change may
have been caused by natural agents, given the magnitude
of the excavation activities and the amount of hiker traffic
that occurs in this area, anthropogenic causes for all of the
detected change cannot be ruled out. No further attempt
has been made at understanding the causal geomorphologic
factors affecting the site during this time frame (September
2007 to April 2010).
Between April 2010 and September 2010, we identified
one area of erosion and four areas of deposition (fig. 21).
The erosion area is located on the bank of the main gully,
in an area of aeolian sediments, and coincides with the
ER3 area from the September 2007 to April 2010 interval
that also underwent erosion during that time period. The
four identified areas of deposition between April 2010 and
September 2010 are all located within, and at the bottom
of, the gully channels. Photo comparison between April
2010 and September 2010 indicate that aeolian transport is
potentially responsible for at least some of the deposition.
However, careful review of photos indicates that some
bank erosion located in difficult-to-model (and therefore
unquantified) overhanging channel walls occurred during this
time period. This suggests that channelized flow led to bank
collapses, and these collapses may be responsible for the
additional in-channel deposition. In general, although both
the erosion and deposition areas are relatively small, they
indicate that geomorphic processes continue to be active at
this site, even over short time intervals (5 months).

AZ:C:13:0099 Playa Area
Upstream of the AZ:C:13:0099 gully system is a
formerly ponded area, now infilled by wind-blown sand
and water-deposited silts and clays, colloquially called a
“playa.” The area is a former backwater channel of the
Colorado River and is a relatively flat surface in which
water has ponded and evaporated (figs. 22 and 23). A
hard-pan, evaporite-rich, fine grained crust covers most
of the site, potentially providing at least some protection
to rapid gullying from overland flow. The playa area has
been monitored by terrestrial lidar five times since 2006.
Although not an archeological site in itself, several such
sites border the playa, and evidence of ongoing channelized
flow erosion indicates that this area could be an indicator
for potential change at these other archeological sites.
Overland flow on the playa surface has created several
shallow channels that drain to a single major channel that
runs through the playa (fig. 22) and into the AZ:C13:0099
site (gully G2, fig. 18). Isolated rockfall deposits, consisting
of large boulders several meters in maximum dimension, are
located throughout the area and generally redirect the paths
of smaller drainages that converge at the north end of the
playa. Whereas the playa itself is devoid of any vegetation,
mature mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana)
border it in many locations. We identified overland flow as
the primary geomorphic process affecting this site.
Change detection analysis results for the first three
surveys spanning 2006–2007 for this area are provided
by Collins and others (2009). Previous surveys detected
only one minor area of erosion related to channel widening
between May 2006 and May 2007. Here, we provide

change detection results between September 2007 and the
two 2010 datasets.
Surface comparison between September 2007 and April
2010 datasets identify six small areas of erosion and one area of
deposition (fig. 24, table 9). The six erosion areas are all centrally
located and formed in the largest of the shallow channels that
traverse the playa. The depth of erosion (between 6 and 8 cm) is
roughly coincident with the existing channel depth, suggesting
that erosion took place through channel widening rather than
channel deepening during channelized flow events. The one area
of deposition is also located in the central channel on an inside
bend, directly across from an erosion area. It is very likely that
some of the sediment eroded from ER1, ER2, and (or) ER3 was
redeposited here, whereas the remainder and that from erosion
areas ER4, ER5, and ER6 was carried further downstream, out
of the playa area, as evidenced by the lack of other depositional
areas within the study region. These observations and
measurements suggest that whereas channelized flow processes
are actively shaping the playa area, the hardened evaporative
crust has thus far successfully prevented additional downcutting.
Therefore, channel widening from surface water runoff during
storm events appears to be the current major geomorphic process
affecting this area.
Between April 2010 and September 2010, we identified
only one minor area of erosion (fig. 25, table 9). The erosion
was located in the same vicinity of the September 2007 to
April 2010 ER1 area (see above discussion) and consisted of
approximately 5 cm of channel sidewall widening. Like the
erosion areas identified between September 2007 and April
2010, the location of this erosion, in an outside bend near
the first instance of significant channel incision, reflects the
continued role of channelized flow in shaping the playa surface.

Topographic Change Detection at Select Archeological Sites in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 2007–2010

Site AZ:C:13:0321
Site AZ:C:13:0321 was not investigated by previous lidar
surveys, and therefore the April and September 2010 surveys
presented the first opportunity for detailed change detection
analysis. The site is located very close (~ 60 m) to the Colorado River within an active dune area that receives sediment
from a neighboring river sand bar (figs. 26 and 27). An archeologically important slab-lined roasting feature, which contains
fire-cracked rocks, ash, and wood charcoal, is located within
the sand dunes and just above the lowest part of a channelshaped hollow formed between the dunes (Fairley and others,
1994). The feature is intermittently buried by aeolian sand,
and thus its protection is tied directly to the geomorphology
of the nearby sand bar. The hollow between the dunes slopes
towards the river’s edge, but no indications of overland flow
are readily evident (O’Brien and Pederson, 2009a). This hollow is often used as a hiking path by river runners accessing
terrain inland from a popular camping beach. Whereas the site
is predominantly located within dune sands, several areas of
gravel-pebble slope wash are also located in the hollow bottom. Western honey mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa) with
a full spectrum of maturity (that is, some dying, others with
healthy vigor) surround the site. Within the site, a wide variety
of isolated vegetation is established within the dune sands and
gravel substrate, including globemallow (Sphaeralcea sp.),
arrow weed (Pluchea sericea), four-wing saltbush (Atriplex
sp.), sand verbena (Abronia elliptica), and nonnative Russian

thistle (Salsola tragus) (Draut, 2011). O’Brien and Pederson
(2009a) identified aeolian transport as the primary geomorphic process affecting this site. They also noted that aeolian
removal of sand can sometimes expose archeological artifacts,
making them vulnerable to anthropogenic trailing. Additional
site details are included in O’Brien and Pederson (2009a).
We performed change detection throughout the immediate area of the hollow bottom, focusing on areas in and around
one of the archeological features (fig. 26). This area has been
the subject of additional investigation focusing on the development of sandbars that result from high flow experiments
and on the effect that aeolian processes may have in moving
sediment from river sand bars to archeological sites (Draut and
others, 2010a,b).
Surface comparison between the April 2010 and September 2010 datasets identified two areas of erosion within
the analyzed site boundary (fig. 28, table 10), consisting of an
area (ER1) along the upper length of the hollow, directly adjacent to the slab-lined roasting feature, and several smaller disconnected areas (ER2) towards the river to the south. Because
of the long length (~ 8 m) over which erosion occurred and
recent (2010) observed aeolian activity immediately downhollow (towards the river), we suggest that aeolian processes
were the most likely agent for this erosion. However, because
the majority of the erosion area also coincides with a path
used by hikers traversing the site, anthropogenic effects such
as surface compaction from foot traffic cannot be ruled out as
a contributing factor.

Sites AZ:C:13:0346 and AZ:C:13:0348
Sites AZ:C:13:0346 and AZ:C:13:0348 (both of which
are referred to collectively as AZ:C:13:0348 when reporting
change detection analysis results) are two adjoining sites that
have been monitored by terrestrial lidar four times since 2006.
The sites are archeologically important as an area of Puebloan
II habitation and contain remains of jacal-type structures,
built by planting wood posts in the ground, weaving sticks
between the posts, and plastering the wooden framework with
mud (Fairley and others, 1994). The area also contains dense
deposits of surface artifacts, including pottery sherds and stone
tools. The combined site areas include the terminus of a broad
alluvial fan of slope-wash deposits that grades into an alluvial
terrace scarp adjoining a former flood plain of the Colorado
River (figs. 29 and 30). Three small gullies (G1, G2, and G3)
traverse the sites and terminate on the alluvial terrace, which
in turn grades into an area of sand dunes that cap the terrace
along the river’s edge. Brush and rock check dams have been
used in gullies G1 and G3 in the past to mitigate ongoing
erosion at several locations within this site (O’Brien and
Pederson, 2009b). Vegetation consists of irregularly spaced,
small desert seepweed bushes (Suaeda moquinii) and larger
mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana), which in
some cases are sufficiently dense to partially obscure gullies
from overhead observations. O’Brien and Pederson (2009a)
identified gullying, aeolian transport, and overland flow as the
geomorphic processes affecting these sites but also observed
that visitor-induced trailing was also causing erosion. They
also noted that whereas the majority of the site appeared stable
with respect to erosion of archeological resources, additional
gullying could lead to negative site impacts. Additional site
details are included in O’Brien and Pederson (2009a,b).
Change detection analysis results for the first three
surveys spanning 2006–2007 are provided by Collins and
others (2009). Previously, two potential areas of erosion
had been identified in gully G1 and G2 between May 2007
and September 2007. Total station measurements of gully

thalwegs by O’Brien and Pederson (2009b) confirmed an
overall erosion signal in gully G1 during this time and also
noted overall, but difficult to quantify, aggradation in gully
G3 between May 2006 and September 2007. Here, we
provide change detection results between September 2007 and
September 2010.
Surface comparison between September 2007 and
September 2010 identified 13 areas of erosion and 3 areas of
deposition (fig. 31, table 11). In general, the changed areas are
located throughout the sites but in close proximity to existing
pockets of either loose dune sands or immature cryptobiotic
crust areas. Noting that the change detection threshold for
these sites is 5 cm, it is possible that some of these pockets of
change are larger in area and linked to one another through
areas with change of less than 5 cm. Most areas (for example,
ER5, ER6, ER8, ER9, ER11) show visual evidence that
suggests aeolian erosion as the dominant geomorphic process
(table 11). Three areas (ER7, DEP2, DEP3) are likely linked
to alluvial fan processes—here outwash sediments appear to
have been transported by overland flow. Overall, these results
identify that both geomorphic agents continue to reshape the
topography of these sites.
We note that additional change areas may also have
occurred at these sites. During the September 2010 survey, the
laser instrument was positioned at slightly different locations
compared to previous survey efforts (Collins and others,
2009). This had the effect of reducing the point density of
some areas of the sites, including the majority of the gullies
that traverse the central slope, and resulted in low confidence
change-detection determination in several areas. In addition,
extremely windy conditions in advance of a storm front in
September 2010 resulted in collection of some data with poor
precision, thereby preventing identification of all potential
areas of change. However, these areas were estimated to
be minor in size compared to the areas where change was
positively detected. Thus, the results presented here should
be taken as reliable, but also as the minimum change that
occurred during this time period.

Topographic Change Detection at Select Archeological Sites in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 2007–2010

Site AZ:B:10:0225
Site AZ:B:10:0225 was previously surveyed only
once, in September 2007. Thus, the most recent September
2010 survey data presented the first opportunity to conduct
detailed change detection analysis at this site. The site is
very close (~ 30 m) to the Colorado River and is located
on a sand ramp that is backed by steep and sometimes
overhanging Tapeats Sandstone ledges (figs. 32 and 33).
The ledges formed shelters for the prehistoric people that
formerly inhabited the area, and the slope below these
shelters is littered with pottery sherds, lithic debitage,
fire-cracked rocks, and other artifacts (Fairley and others,
1994). Two large gullies (G1 and G2) traverse the edges of
the site and fall steeply over sandstone ledges, terminating
near the river’s edge in a deposit of large (~20 cm to 1 m
diameter) boulders. The gullies are infilled with aeolian
sand transported from nearby dunes and potentially from a
large river sand bar located directly across the river from
the site. Area vegetation includes isolated catclaw acacia
(Acacia greggii), prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), goldenbush
(Isocoma acradenia), ephedra (Ephedra sp.), brittlebush
(Encelia sp.), trixis (Trixis californica), and perennial bunch
grasses such as Indian rice grass (Achnatherum hymenoides).
Tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima) and arrowweed (Pluchea
sericea) border the site near the river’s edge and lower dune
areas. O’Brien and Pederson (2009a) identified gullying,
overland flow, aeolian transport, and creep as the geomorphic
processes affecting this site and noted that both gullying and
creep were incrementally eroding artifacts here. Additional
site details are included in O’Brien and Pederson (2009a).
Although no pre-September 2007 datasets are available
for analysis, on-site observations of a large storm event
immediately prior to the September 2007 survey bracket
the time frame in which formation of the existing gullied
topography at this site, and particular in gully G2, must have
occurred. Surface comparison between September 2007 and
September 2010 indicates that additional major changes

occurred to this site during this 3-year period, consisting of
11 areas of erosion and 7 areas of deposition (fig. 34, table
12). On the sideslope of G1, erosion of as much as 50 cm
and deposition of as much as 32 cm occurred, most likely
from aeolian processes. Net sediment volume removed was
approximately 1.6 m3, consisting of five areas of erosion
(ER1 through ER5) and four areas of deposition (DEP1
through DEP4). Whereas gully G1 was already eroded to
bedrock (Tapeats Sandstone ledges or slope wash boulders)
throughout the majority of the gully bottom in September
2007, gully G2 was founded on slope wash boulders only
in the upper section of the gully. In the lower section of
gully G2, weakly lithified dune sands formed sharp, vertical
sidewalls as much as 1 m deep in September 2007 (see
cover image). By September 2010, massive gully erosion
and sidewall slumping had occurred, removing 114.8 m3 of
sediment (areas ER 8 and ER9), with average and maximum
depths of erosion of 52 cm and 160 cm, respectively. Side
slopes in September 2010 were smoothed to the sand’s
angle of repose, and infilling had begun to reshape the gully
bottom (DEP5). Net volumetric erosion in G2 (that is, ER8 +
ER9 - DEP5) was 105.6 m3. The geomorphic processes that
occurred at G2 are gully erosion (ER8 and ER9) followed by
aeolian sand infilling (DEP5) and topographic smoothing.
Additional minor erosion and deposition also occurred
within the central slope area, located between gullies G1
and G2 (DEP6, DEP7, ER10), that forms the bulk of the
archeological site area. The likely geomorphic agent for
these changes is aeolian sand transport. The minor area
of erosion located between the gullies (ER11) could have
been caused by soil creep processes; O’Brien and Pederson
(2009a) identified creep as one of the dominant processes
at this site. It is possible that minor additional change also
occurred throughout this area; however, regularly spaced
low-lying grasses and shrubs growing on the dune slope
prevented additional detailed analysis of this area. If changes
did occur, they are judged to have been relatively minor (that
is, smaller in area and volume than ER11).

Site AZ:G:03:0072 US
Site AZ:G:03:0072 US (upstream) and site
AZ:G:03:0072 DS (downstream) form a single archeological
site but were divided into two survey areas because of their
large spatial extent. The entire site has been monitored
by terrestrial lidar four times since 2006. This site is a
prehistoric and protohistoric habitation area containing
sparse surface artifacts and numerous agave roasting pits
(Fairley and others, 1994). The upstream survey area
(AZ:G:03:0072 US) consists of a convex hillslope that
bounds an alluvial terrace that slopes down to the Colorado
River, and it is further bounded on one side by a boulderchoked channel and on the other by steep slopes and
outcrops of basalt cliffs (figs. 35 and 36). Three gullies
traverse this part of the site; two (G1 and G2) are founded
on alluvial fill cobbles and boulders, whereas the other (G3)
cuts through an active sand dune. The sand dune extends
from gully G2 to the western edge of the site near the
boulder-choked channel. Brush check dams were installed
in gully G2 in May 2006 (O’Brien and Pederson, 2009b).
Vegetation consists of clumps of grasses, smaller bushes,
and prickly pear cactus (Opuntia basilaris), along with
taller groups of ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), cholla
(Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa), and larger creosote (Larrea
tridentata var. tridentata) and catclaw acacia (Acacia
greggii) several meters in height. O’Brien and Pederson
(2009a) identified gullying, creep, aeolian transport, and
overland flow as the geomorphic processes affecting this
site and noted that archeological features were actively
being eroded by these processes. Additional site details are
included in O’Brien and Pederson (2009a,b).

55

Change detection analysis results for the first three
surveys spanning 2006–2007 are provided by Collins and
others (2009). Previously, substantial erosion was detected
distributed throughout all three gullies in addition to the dune
slope between G2 and G3. O’Brien and Pederson (2009b)
also measured significant erosion in gully G2 and minimal
erosion in G1 between May 2006 and September 2007. Here,
we provide change detection results between September
2007 and September 2010.
Surface comparison between September 2007 and
September 2010 indicate that major changes continued to occur
at this site, consisting of erosion in two of the three gullies and
throughout the mid-area sand dune field (fig. 37, table 13).
In total, 14 areas of erosion and 6 areas of deposition were
identified. Whereas average erosion and deposition depths were
11 and 16 cm, respectively, maximum values reached between
50 and 60 cm. The vast majority of the erosion and deposition
within the mid-area dune field and in the gully G3 vicinity more
than likely occurred as a result of aeolian processes. In general,
the spatial pattern of aeolian erosion and deposition indicates
a southwest to northeast transport vector (for example, from
ER5 to DEP1 and from ER14 to DEP5). Significant erosion and
deposition also occurred within gully G3 (ER8, ER10, ER11,
DEP2, DEP3, DEP4, DEP6), and our observations indicate that
both overland flow and aeolian processes were active in this
area. Massive bank failure (ER11, fig. 37) and smoothing of the
upper gully surface (DEP2 and DEP3) are indicated by the data
and site observations. The only change detected in the gully
G1 and G2 areas was a small bank collapse in gully G2 (ER1,
fig. 37). This is consistent with the generalized characteristics
within this area (grassy vegetated and cryptobiotic soil crusts),
indicating a more stable site condition here.

Site AZ:G:03:0072 DS
The downstream area of site AZ:G:03:0072
(AZ:G:03:0072 DS) has been monitored by terrestrial lidar
four times since 2006. Identically to the upstream area, this
part of the site contains abundant evidence of prehistoric
and protohistoric habitation (Fairley and others, 1994). The
area consists of a convex hillslope bounded by two larger,
boulder-filled channels (figs. 35 and 38). The upper part of
the slope is relatively flat, and three small gullies traverse
this area, steepening as they join the bordering channels
below. Rock check dams exist in the steepest sections of
some of these gullies. Vegetation includes a broad mix of
cacti, including prickly pear (Opuntia basilaris) and ocotillo
(Fouquieria splendens), as well as several larger mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana) and catclaw acacia
(Acacia greggii) trees. In the gullies, large vegetation is
generally absent, but soils appear to be stabilized by both
grasses and cryptobiotic crust. O’Brien and Pederson (2009a)

identified gullying, creep, aeolian transport, and overland
flow as the geomorphic processes affecting this site and
noted that archeological features were actively being eroded
by these processes. Additional site details are included in
O’Brien and Pederson (2009a,b).
Change detection analysis results for the first three
surveys spanning 2006–2007 are provided by Collins and
others (2009). Previously, no significant change was detected
at this site. Here, we provide change detection results between
September 2007 and the two 2010 datasets.
Surface comparison between September 2007 and
September 2010 indicate that no significant changes
occurred during this time (fig. 39). In general, this area of
site AZ:G:03:0072 appears stable with regard to existing
gullies—most channel substrates are either bedrock-controlled
or protected by dense grasses, thereby preventing substantial
erosion. In addition, no recent aeolian sand deposits are
present here—most areas are stabilized by cryptobiotic crust
or are covered by grasses and larger vegetation.

Analysis and Optimization of Other Metrics of Archeological Site Stability

Analysis and Optimization of Other
Metrics of Archeological Site Stability
Whereas the bulk of this research is aimed at
increasing the accuracy of topographic change detection on
archeological sites along the Colorado River corridor, we
also undertook several studies to investigate and optimize
additional applications of lidar surveying for monitoring other
types of changes at archeological sites. These studies are
more than simply new directions to push this technology—
they address existing science questions that have eluded
answers because of the difficulty in collecting the highaccuracy data needed to shed light on processes affecting site
stability. These questions include:
• Are archeological structures stable or actively
deteriorating, and if deteriorating, where and by how
much?
• Are surface artifacts moving position, and if so, by
how much?
• Are cryptobiotic soil crusts changing (expanding or
shrinking), and if so, by how much?
They also address several technique-specific questions such
as:
• Can lidar-linked photography be used to model gully
thalwegs as an indicator of site change, above and
beyond existing, traditional survey methods?
• How can lidar scan positioning be optimized with
respect to point density to model archeological site
change most efficiently and with the least amount of
site disturbance?
We address each of these questions separately here.

Monitoring Archeological Structure Stability
With the increased accuracy of the latest generation of laser
scanners, monitoring even subtle changes in topography is now
achievable. This provides an important avenue for change detection studies, including monitoring the stability of structures and the
movement of individual structural elements (for example, many
habitation sites in Grand Canyon have above-ground structures
with walls formed from stacked rocks). At some sites, stacked rock
walls have been built abutting steep slopes that may be subject
to soil creep as a dominant process (see, for example, Tressler,
2011; Tressler and Pederson, 2010); this suggests that monitoring
this process using high-accuracy surveys can lead to increased
awareness of potential site instability. Whereas some lasers (that
is, those with a phase-based laser mechanism) can collect data at
the submillimeter scale, performing change detection on objects,
especially those in a natural setting, remains challenging because
of inaccuracies in global coordinate positioning. In most cases, at
best, reoccupying laser scan and control point locations is generally only achievable at the centimeter scale.

61

To test the application of terrestrial lidar change detection
on habitation structures, we performed consecutive temporal lidar
surveys of several rock walls that formed habitation structures
used by prehistoric farmers in the 11th and 12th centuries (Fairley
and others, 1994) at site AZ:C:13:0009 (figs. 40 and 41). The site
is located on an alluvial terrace bounded on one side by a side
canyon arroyo and on the other by dunes adjacent to the Colorado
River. Dune sands mantle parts of the site, along with slope wash
boulders and scattered clumps of vegetation. Vegetation includes
brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), western honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia sp.), and a variety of
perennial bunch grasses. O’Brien and Pederson (2009a) identified
gullying, creep, and aeolian transport as the primary geomorphic
processes affecting this site and noted that these processes are currently destroying archeological resources at the site. Additional site
details are included in O’Brien and Pederson (2009a).
We collected four scans of the area both in April 2010 and
again in September 2010, focusing specifically on capturing the
detailed topography of seven areas where the remains of habitation structures are visible on the surface. Data were processed
identically as described previously for the other 2010 datasets.
Following processing, specific rocks or groups of rocks that
represent the remains of habitation structures were identified
and isolated for analysis. We analyzed the three-dimensional
change at each area by two methods. First, we calculated the
distance between each set (April 2010 and September 2010) by
computing the mean distance between each group of points that
represent the same set of rocks (fig. 42). Second, we constrained
the mean distance comparison to only those data that represent
the best fit between the two sets of data. This represents a slight
improvement in relative fit, in that unmatched points are not
used in the data comparison (that is, the numbers of points used
for comparison are less than the first method—see table 14). We
note that the two algorithms are essentially the same, with the
first analysis using all the points and the second using only those
points that represent the best fit.
The results (table 14) show that the three-dimensional distances (that is, the changes in position) between sets of rocks are
all on the order of 1 to 3 cm. Standard deviations were less than
1 cm in most cases. Because these distances are also on the order
of the previously established empirical error thresholds (that is, 3
cm for change detection between the April 2010 and September
2010 datasets), we conclude that either (1) the rocks representing the remains of the habitation structures did not move during
the monitoring time period, or (2) if the rocks did move, it was
on a magnitude less than the error threshold of 3 cm. With either
selection, the main conclusion is that monitoring of habitation
structures using the methods presented herein (that is, using
repeat, temporally distinct survey and control point locations)
is not capable of determining change detection at the 1 to 2 cm
scale. As previously mentioned, phase-based scanners might be
used in the future as an improvement if subcentimeter change
detection were required, but with the majority of the errors
linked to georeferencing and registration, the use of permanently
fixed, repeatedly occupied, monuments for setting up survey and
control point locations would likely be required.

Monitoring Artifact Movement
For archeological sites with surface artifacts (for example, pieces of pottery or piles of fire-cracked rock) quantitative
tracking of changes in artifact position could provide a useful
metric related to archeological site stability. Tressler (2011)
and Tressler and Pederson (2010) showed that tracking small
rocks at a fine scale could be used as a proxy for measuring
soil creep, which might govern some aspects of site stability. Tracking changes on this scale (subcentimeter) requires
that: (1) artifacts be recognizable both in photos and in lidar
point clouds and (2) the point density be sufficient to clearly
delineate artifacts of interest. Although the lidar survey data
analyzed in this report were not purposefully collected at sufficiently high density to perform this level of change detection, we performed directed analyses for a simple case where
artifacts were within range of a nearby scan position from a
neighboring site. Here, we present analysis results for a small
subset of data from site AZ:C:13:0334 (fig. 43A), located in
the Palisades region. The site has essentially the same characteristics as that previously described for the AZ:C:13:0099
playa area, with the addition that aeolian transport is also an
active process here. Additional site details are included in
O’Brien and Pederson (2009a).
The lidar data for our analyses consist of a single scan
collected from each of the April and September 2010 surveys at
an approximate range of between 21 m and 24 m and focused
on an area containing a sizable concentration of individual
rock fragments; each fragment measured approximately 1 to 4
cm in longest dimension. These georeferenced data, cropped
to an area of approximately 4,250 m2, are accurate to a mean
point-to-point matching error of 8 mm, with 6 mm standard

deviation. Thus, the data are only sufficiently accurate to perform change detection at a scale of 1 to 2 cm, at best. Despite
this limitation, we performed lidar-directed change detection
analysis for the two datasets in hope that artifacts could be at
least visible in the point cloud data. Unfortunately, despite the
generally close range between artifacts and scanner location,
we determined that the point density (0.05 to 0.11 points/cm2 or
approximately 3 to 5 cm spacing) was insufficient to delineate
individual objects (fig. 43B).
Increased point density was not specifically collected at
this site because of our focus on whole-site (large-area) data
collection. However, other studies (for example, Tressler and
Pederson, 2010) using data from our previous surveys (Collins and others, 2009) have shown that sufficient point density
(4 points/cm2) can be collected using short-range (~4 m)
instrument locations and used to track centimeter-scale rock
clast movement. Thus, the obvious conclusion is that point
density must be maximized to at least the 2-points/cm2 range
(subcentimeter point spacing) to detect artifacts of this type at
this range, and a metric relating an artifact of any size to the
required point density can easily be calculated for a specific
area of interest. Whereas this might be within the range of
some topographically directed terrestrial lidar instruments, it
might also exceed the instruments’ accuracy specifications.
Our recommendations, therefore, are to use either phasebased laser scanning instruments with both improved (millimeter-scale) accuracy and resolution or close-range (<10 m)
digital photogrammetry. However, georeferencing errors may
still be the greatest limitation when using lidar methods and
would require a local (that is, site-scale) network of permanent control points to be established and repeatedly occupied
for all initial and subsequent surveys.

Detection and Mapping of Cryptobiotic Soil Crust
Biological soil crusts (herein referred to interchangeably
as cryptobiotic soil crusts or cryptobiotic crusts) are important
components of desert ecosystems (Belnap and others, 2001),
including those found at many archeological sites in Grand
Canyon. Cryptobiotic crusts form at the soil surface and are
composed of living bacteria, algae, fungi, lichens, and mosses
(Belnap and others, 2001). They are generally resilient in
some respects (for example, they can withstand drying and
wetting) but are susceptible to damage from compaction
(for example, by footsteps), which can destroy the crustforming organisms, thereby disrupting growth. The presence
or absence of cryptobiotic crust at an archeological site can
be indicative of site stability and the degree to which surficial
erosion processes are active at a site, because crusts keep wind
from transporting sediment out of sites, prevent rainsplashand runoff-induced erosion, and are often precursors to the
establishment of vegetation that may then further inhibit both
aeolian and overland flow erosion. Knowing and tracking the
areal extent of cryptobiotic crust in and near archeological
sites is therefore a potentially important component of
archeological site stability monitoring.
Existing methods of mapping cryptobiotic crusts are
generally implemented by visual techniques—soils are
inspected in the field and several classes of development
are distinguished from one another according to established
protocols (for example, Tongway and Smith, 1989; Belnap
and others, 2001). The areal extent of cryptobiotic crust at
a particular site can be mapped directly on a photographic
base map, such as a low-altitude orthophotograph, or can
be mapped by survey boundary methods, such as GPS
or total station. Whereas these techniques are likely the
most conclusive ways to determine what is and what is

not a cryptobiotic crust, they may cause disturbance to the
archeological and/or biologic properties of a site through
human impacts (for example, from footprints and survey rod
imprints). Mapping techniques using airborne and satellite
remote sensing techniques already exist (for example, Karnieli
and others, 2001; Chen and others, 2005), but these are
generally more suited for large-scale (that is, hundreds of
square kilometers) investigations. Use of smaller scale remote
sensing methods, such as terrestrial lidar, may therefore offer
a means of minimizing potential impacts during cryptobiotic
crust surveys at the scale of an individual archeological
site. Already, the use of combined photomapping with
terrestrial lidar has been applied to geologic outcrop mapping
(for example, Bellian and others, 2005), and close-range
hyperspectral imaging has been combined with terrestrial
lidar mapping (for example, Kurz and others, 2011). This
technology is therefore moving rapidly forward.
We examine the use of terrestrial lidar for mapping
cryptobiotic soils through an example taken from Site
AZ:C:05:0031 using the April 2010 data. Here, both uncrusted,
loose dune sands and cryptobiotic-crusted sands are located in
discrete locations within the general area of the archeological
site. In addition to positional (x, y, z) and color channel (red,
green, blue) data, our laser system also collected laser signal
amplitude data. Laser signal amplitude is a measure of signal
return strength and is dependent on target material type, range
between target and laser, and laser incident angle. The use
of laser signal amplitude for determining the areal extent of
a particular substrate, such as cryptobiotic crust, is therefore
not ideal because remote sensing campaigns should be rangeindependent. That is, they should only be based on the material
type—an attribute that could potentially be more appropriately
extracted if the laser reflective intensity were measured. When
collected, the data can very often be discretized and range

66

Topographic Change Detection at Select Archeological Sites in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 2007–2010

normalized (see, for example, Kaasalainen and others, 2011).
Unfortunately, most existing time-of-flight terrestrial lidar
systems (including the type used in our study) are not capable
of measuring reflective intensity and therefore cannot be used
for this purpose. Currently, some aerial lidar sensors, phasebased terrestrial scanners, and only the newest generation of
time-of-flight terrestrial lidar units offer this capability (so-called
“full waveform” measurements). Despite this equipment-based
limitation, we explored the use of terrestrial lidar for cryptobiotic
crust mapping by examining the laser strength amplitude for
a narrow range of point cloud data from the archeological
site. This resulted in normalizing the effect of laser range over
the investigated area (that is, comparable at this range only),
but it was then not applicable to the entire archeological site
considered as a whole. Our methodology consisted of:
1.

Visually identifying areas of both highly developed
(that is, level of development > 4; Belnap and others,
2008) cryptobiotic crusted and uncrusted dune sands
at a similar laser range (approximately 35 m) both
through high-resolution digital images (figs. 44 A,B)
and through on-site mapping (Amy Draut, written
commun., August 2011). Areas with minimal to no
vegetation were purposely selected. An approximately similar area (roughly 6 to 8m2) was used for
each substrate by integrating three smaller dune sand
areas to be of approximate equivalent areal extent as
the one cryptobiotic crust area (table 15).

2.

Digitally outlining the identified cryptobiotic crust
and uncrusted dune sand areas in the point cloud
data from a single vantage point and single point
cloud to minimize laser incidence effects (fig. 44C ).

3.

Filtering the point clouds to contain only those
points within the cryptobiotic crust and uncrusted
dune sand boundaries.

4.

Querying the segregated point cloud statistics (for
example, mean, standard deviation) for laser return
amplitude, as a measure of signal strength for each
substrate (table 15).

5.

Filtering the entire point cloud by the mean plus one
standard deviation for each substrate (cryptobiotic
crust or sand) to see if there is a quantitative distinction
for areas covered with cryptobiotic crust (fig. 45).

The results indicate that there is a clear laser signal
amplitude distinction (measured on a relative scale from
0, low, to 65,535, high) between the cryptobiotic crust and
uncrusted dune sand areas (table 15). The mean value for
cryptobiotic crust is approximately 450 amplitude units
above that for the uncrusted sand areas, and at one standard
deviation there is almost no overlap between pixels with
identical signal strengths. Mapping of the point cloud using
a mean +/- one standard deviation (that is, ± 1σ) threshold
shows that the different amplitudes effectively segregate the
cryptobiotic crust areas from the uncrusted dune sand areas
(fig. 45). Thus, this exercise shows that a clear distinction
in identifying cryptobiotic soil crust from uncrusted dune
sands based on laser amplitude was achievable for at least
a small patch of data at a single range. These results are
substantiated by previous work on this subject using slightly
different techniques (for example, identifying different rock
lithology with combined photo-lidar methods, see Bellian
and others, 2005). However, as previously discussed, a
thorough comparison of the entire site (that is, at different
ranges) is not possible because of the effects of range on
signal amplitude and because vegetation and other substrates
(for example, rocks, see fig. 45) impair a clear evaluation
of the amplitude signal over a larger region. The use of a
full waveform laser that collects reflective intensity data,
especially if collected from an airborne platform, would
likely alleviate these issues.

Gully Thalweg Determination From Combined
Lidar-Photography
One of the most visible signs of archeological site change
in the Colorado River corridor is the ongoing erosion of
gully channels that traverse through these sites. Researchers
(for example, Hereford and others, 1991; Fairley and others,
1994; Leap and others, 1997; Pederson and others, 2006) have
documented the incision and formation of gullies, and some
of these gullies are now effectively removing artifacts from
their original locations and transporting them into the Colorado
River to be lost downstream. Although the debate on the cause
and the long-term rate of incision of these gullies is a broader
topic reflecting the relative influences of natural verses anthropogenic sources for the erosion, knowledge of their location
and change over time is needed for an informed analysis of this
subject. Whereas existing survey methods (for example, conventional total station surveys) exist for obtaining these data
(for example, Hazel and others, 2008; O’Brien and Pederson,
2009b), the accuracy and relatively high impact of these methods (that is, requiring a person to stand in, and traverse through,
an archeological site) prompted a reevaluation of remotely
sensed methods by the USGS to obtain this type of data.
In 2006, Collins and others (2008) performed a study
to compare the use of terrestrial lidar methods verses total
station methods in generating high-resolution, accurate

long profiles of gully thalwegs at archeological sites in the
Colorado River corridor. In general, the study showed that
lidar can be used as an effective tool, but that the method,
as applied in 2006, had limitations regarding the ability to
track such fine-scale detail as gully kickpoints in areas of
complex topography. Further, the water-drop pathway algorithm utilized (involving automated computational methods
to interrogate a surface model and determine the channel
flow path) had limitations when the topography was shallow
in slope. In these instances, the algorithm did not always
determine the lowest, most efficient flow line, thereby creating unrealistically complex and tortuous channel flow paths.
Whereas the overall results (mean difference errors of less
than 5 cm between total station and lidar) closely mimicked
the total vertical analytical error of the lidar and total station
instruments used (4.3 cm and 1.3 cm, respectively), standard deviations of the same difference errors (between 5 and
19 cm) highlighted the variability of the data comparison.
Collins and others (2008) therefore concluded that feature
identification and thalweg mapping using the methods used
at that time were not reliable to the degree needed to implement them on a wider, more regular basis for monitoring
gully erosion at archeological sites.
With the rapid advancement of lidar technology since
the 2006 study (Collins and others, 2008), new instruments
(including that used in the present study) have become

Analysis and Optimization of Other Metrics of Archeological Site Stability
available that are more accurate and that offer the ability to
perform photo-based mapping on lidar point cloud data. This
new technology thereby has the potential to better tackle the
thalweg mapping question by use of a remotely sensed methodology. Therefore, as part of the present study, we collected
channel thalweg data at approximately 2.5-m intervals (judged
as an efficient spacing and of sufficient resolution at this site)
using a total station at the AZ:C:13:0099 playa area site (fig.
46; see also figs. 22 and 23) so that a direct comparison of this
data to a lidar-extracted thalweg could be made. Because the
channel at this site is not technically a gully (not steep walled),
it provides a somewhat more robust evaluation (that is, topographic subtleties in its lower overall profile are more difficult
to discern). The methodology involved “coloring” the point
cloud data using the calibrated high-resolution photographs
collected through a Nikon D200 digital SLR camera mounted
to the top of the laser (fig. 4). The colored point clouds were
then utilized in two ways:
1.

A surface model (TIN) was created, colored, and
textured using the photos in order to try to determine
the thalweg using the now photo-draped model.

2.

The colored point cloud was used to virtually map
the thalweg at approximately 0.75-m intervals
(again, judged efficient and of sufficient resolution
for this site) by optical-manual recognition using the
combined colored topography.

The first method was unsuccessful in accurately depicting
a suitable surface model for channel thalweg extraction. Limitations included the need to filter the dataset to at least some minimum threshold in order to generate a surface model for color
and texture modeling. The filtering effectively limited the resolution of the model, such that the thalweg was then “blurred”
and difficult to identify. Although photo-draping algorithms are

69

rapidly becoming more sophisticated, we did not find the methods efficient or accurate during the present evaluation.
The second method of direct thalweg mapping on the
colored point cloud was much more successful. Here, approximately 100 m of the thalweg was mapped using 136 points
(compared to 37 using total station) on a combined colored
point cloud consisting of data from five separate scan locations. Horizontal plane accuracy was good (fig. 47), with
maximum differences on the order of 20 cm. In general, these
were due to the coarser resolution of the total station data.
Profile view accuracy was also exceptional (fig. 48), with
mean difference errors between the long profiles generated by
lidar and total station of only 0.2 cm and 84 percent of the data
within a 2-cm vertical error bound. This is therefore a vast
improvement over the results obtained by Collins and others
(2008), especially so because the thalweg investigated here is
relatively flat—such situations had earlier been highlighted as
a limitation of lidar methods.
Because the lidar-generated thalweg was based on an
order-of-magnitude larger number of points, the long profile
is evidently longer and more variable. However, in only two
locations (at approximately the 33-m and 65-m distance marks—
see fig. 48) were the lidar data significantly different from the
total station data. Here, we determined that the differences
were due to a lack of point density in the total station data—the
differences were located in two low-lying areas of the thalweg
where “pools” developed (a result of filling and subsequent
drying of the channel), such that the total station likely missed
locating these lower visibility features. In summary, the use
of photo-colored point clouds for mapping channel thalwegs
proved to be a vast improvement over previous attempts to
identify subtle topographic features such as these. This method
thus shows much promise for mapping geomorphic change in
gully systems, as long as the limitations discussed by Collins and
others (2008) are avoided (namely, surveying in highly vegetated
areas that obscure any view of the gully thalweg).

Effect of Survey Location on Lidar Point Density
Lidar point density is affected by a suite of factors,
including laser specifications, range to target, and obliquity
of laser incident angle. In most cases, point density can
be optimized by selecting appropriate, overlapping laser
scanner survey setup locations with good laser-to-target
incident angles. Olsen and others (2009) showed how this
can be determined for near-vertical coastal bluffs scanned
from evenly spaced beach locations fronting the bluffs.
When scanning flatter topography, such as that found in
many archeological sites in Grand Canyon, optimizing point
density can be difficult because of the lack of suitable scan
locations that offer near-perpendicular trajectories to the
target. This problem is typically resolved by collecting data
from additional scan locations, resulting in more time on site
and possibly more site impacts. When surrounding topography
offers an overview of a survey area (fig. 49A), the best results
are often achieved. However, the final point density can
decrease if the scan location is positioned beyond a laserdefined distance threshold (that is, as defined by the angular
step increment of the laser at far range). Here, we provide
results from a study conducted at the AZ:C:13:0099 playa area

that verified this effect. The study was conducted to show that
whereas far-field (>100 m) scanning from a high vantage point
can effectively resolve geomorphic-scale topographic features,
near-field (<30 m) scanning is still needed for resolving small,
archeological-scale features.
Following existing archeological site lidar monitoring
protocols, five near-field scans were collected at the
AZ:C:13:0099 playa area. In addition, one far-field scan
was collected from the approximate mid-height of a steep
talus slope adjacent to the site (fig. 22). The near-field scans
collected data at a horizontal and vertical angular resolution of
0.05°, whereas the far-field scan was set to collect data at an
angular resolution of 0.02° (the maximum allowed by the laser
scanner instrument at this field of view). In general, minimum
laser scan incident angles (as measured from the horizontal
to the maximum trajectory covering the data collection area)
ranged from 8° to 11° for the near-field data and from 16°
to 21° for the far-field data. Thus, the far-field setup leads to
approximately double the incident angle, thereby improving
the quantity of potentially usable laser returns. However, the
point density results show that the near-field data far exceeds
the far-field data, as expected. For an area 10 m by 10 m
within the southern end of the playa (representing a typical

72

Topographic Change Detection at Select Archeological Sites in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 2007–2010

area of interest; fig. 49A), the point density from the far-field
(from one scan position, see “FF” in fig. 22) is 180 points/m2
(fig. 49B), whereas the point density from the near-field (also
from one scan position, see “NF” in fig. 22) is 13,130 points/
m2 (fig. 49C), an increase in two orders of magnitude. With
the near-field data, geomorphic subtleties such as channel
fingering are captured, whereas with the far-field data, only the
overarching topography is captured. The tradeoff here is the
relative area in which data collection occurs. In this example,
the single far-field scan captures the entire area of interest
(~10,300 m2; table 4), whereas the near-field data require
five independent scan locations and twice the amount of time
(also potentially increasing site impacts) to capture the same
area. Further, it is technically possible that a higher degree of
accuracy could be obtained using only a single far-field scan
because registration errors between multiple scans might be
avoided. However, whereas far-field setups are more efficient
at data collection, near-field setups are required to monitor
and understand geomorphic change at scales of importance for
monitoring archeological site stability.

under new configurations (that is, change occurred at either a
different magnitude or location than previously documented).
For example, at site AZ:C:13:0336, erosion occurred in a gully
that had previously eroded, and also at a new gully location.
These results highlight the dynamic geomorphology of the
Colorado River corridor and the need to monitor sites regularly and repeatedly to understand the geomorphologic effects
on site condition. Overall, and ignoring the results from Site
AZ:C:13:0099 between September 2007 and April 2010,
which were clearly influenced by an unusual anthropogenic
cause (the excavation of the site in 2008), total measured erosion was greater both in area and volume (669 m2 and 157 m3,
respectively) compared to total measured deposition (169 m2

Discussion
This continuing investigation provides new information
about the amount and types of topographic changes affecting
Colorado River corridor archeological sites in Grand
Canyon National Park. In addition, the results present newly
refined techniques for collecting and evaluating topographic
and other types of change data for use in monitoring
overall archeological site stability. These new findings are
summarized below.

A

Archeological Site Change Detection
We detected statistically significant change (greater than
either ±3 cm or ±5 cm, depending on survey dates) at 9 of
10 survey areas, including all 9 archeological sites investigated in the current study (table 16). The only survey area
not showing signs of change was the downstream part of
site AZ:G:03:0072. For the remainder of the surveyed areas,
changes tended to be of larger magnitude between September
2007 and April 2010 than between April 2010 and September 2010, consistent with expectations regarding the length
of time in which changes could have occurred (that is, over
longer time intervals, multiple events could be responsible for
the measured changes). Detected changes range from areas
with large-scale aeolian sand erosion and deposition (for
example, the upstream part of site AZ:G:03:0072) to those
with massive gully erosion generated by overland flow (site
AZ:B:10:0225). Investigation and comparison of specific areas
of change detected between 2006–2007 (Collins and others,
2009) and detected between 2007–2010 (this report) indicate
that some sites changed consistently (that is, with the same
general location and magnitude), whereas other sites changed

Conclusions
and 20 m3, respectively) during the September 2007 to September 2010 time period. It should be noted that not all areas
within the investigated archeological sites were monitored for
change. However, although these conclusions are only technically applicable to the specific areas monitored, they more
than likely correctly capture the overall trend—that of archeological site erosion throughout the Colorado River corridor.
In general, we documented the causes of detected changes
as being related to two primary processes: aeolian transport and
overland/channelized flow. In at least one case (AZ:C:13:0099
between September 2007 and April 2010), anthropogenic
actions influenced the erosion and deposition patterns. From
the magnitude of changes surmised to be due to both overland
flow erosion and aeolian sand erosion and deposition processes,
back-analysis of the meteorological events that caused these
changes should be possible where records of rainfall and wind
direction and speed are available for the time frame in which
the changes occurred (for example, Draut and others, 2009a,b;
2010b). For example, examination of local rainfall and wind
records may identify particularly significant events that could
have caused the magnitude of changes observed and detected
from the data (that is, large-scale gullying or aeolian sand
transport). Whereas this type of analysis is beyond the scope of
this report, if undertaken in the future it would serve to bracket
potential empirical thresholds for the magnitudes of processes
that cause these types of site changes. Unfortunately, comparison of these results with expected and modeled results from the
2008 High Flow Experiment (HFE) (Melis, 2011), which may
have affected the archeological sites monitored here, is not possible because of the 2½-year gap between the dates on which
our data were collected. That is, whereas the September 2007
and April 2010 dates bracket the 2008 HFE in March of that
year, they do not bracket the experiment closely enough to be
able to link changes specifically to effects of the HFE.

Lidar Change Detection Monitoring
Several components of the lidar surveying method used
in this study warrant discussion. First, we note that the accuracy thresholds used for all change detection analyses are a
significant improvement from previous efforts and currently
represent the best achievable limits at this scale. Performing repeat topographic change detection at below a 3-cm
threshold in a remote setting without the use of permanently
installed reoccupiable control points, which generally necessitate at least some archeological site disturbance, will require
significant improvements in both laser and GPS/total station
accuracy. Whereas lidar technology continues to evolve, more
accurately surveying control point locations would require
significant technological advancements that have thus far not
been introduced in rugged field instrumentation.
Second, this study investigated several additional metrics
for evaluating archeological site change that could prove to be
useful with additional advances in technology (for example,
monitoring structural walls, tracking artifact movement,
monitoring cryptobiotic soil crust cover). Here, we introduced

73

available methods of analysis, but also discovered significant
limitations (for example, overall inaccuracy of time-of-flight
lasers for these monitoring purposes, lack of full wave-form
analysis with most current available laser scanners). However, we also suggest that different and newer instrumentation
already available may be able to address these limitations in
some cases. Thus, although this study showed that tracking
some of these site metrics was not possible using the instruments available at the time of data collection, we also posit
that the limitations may be overcome with new technology.
Finally, we show that technological advances have
already been helpful in addressing some previous limitations.
Namely, we conclusively identified a gully thalweg running
through relatively flat topography to a degree of accuracy better than established in previous studies. The use of photo-colored point clouds is certainly a step in the right direction for
this type of analysis, and we expect that additional advances
will make such analyses still more accurate in the future.

Conclusions
Archeological sites within the Colorado River corridor of
Grand Canyon National Park offer a window into the lives of
the people who occupied this region long ago. Given that many
archeological sites are located in areas subject to rapid geomorphologic change, such as alluvial terraces subject to gullying
processes and active aeolian dune fields, understanding the
magnitude and causes of these changes is important for monitoring and managing both short-term and long-term archeological site stability. High-resolution topographic change detection
using terrestrial lidar techniques, coupled with site-specific
geomorphologic analysis of archeological sites, provides much
of the necessary detailed information needed to understand
rates of change and to guide management decisions. Further,
high-resolution, highly accurate data at the scale presented in
this report are required in order to track fine site changes that
might be precursors to larger scale, destructive erosion events.
This information can assist in addressing open questions
regarding what role, if any, sediment-depleted flows from Glen
Canyon Dam have on site stability and what effects visitor use
might have on site deterioration.
In this study, we build upon existing data to generate new
topographic change maps and infer related geomorphologic
causes of archeological site change at 10 survey areas covering 9 archeological sites throughout the length of the Colorado
River corridor over a 3-year period from September 2007 to
September 2010. Eight areas were monitored for change at a
5-cm detection threshold between September 2007 and either
April or September 2010, and six areas (including some of the
eight previously studied) were monitored for change at a 3-cm
detection threshold between April and September 2010. Our
results indicate that 9 of the 10 survey areas exhibited statistically significant topographic change by erosion, deposition,
or both during this time interval and that those changes could
likely be linked to a variety of causes, including overland flow

gullying and aeolian sand transport. Further, taken as a whole
for all sites monitored throughout the river corridor during this
time period, the overall signal was related to erosion rather
than deposition. These results reflect both the active geomorphologic environment in Grand Canyon and the potential for
rapid archeological site change.
We also performed additional studies to test new lidarbased methods of tracking other indicators of archeological
site change, such as structural element and artifact movement,
change in cryptobiotic soil crust extent, and shifts in gully
thalweg position. These results indicate that whereas most
current terrestrial lidar instruments have some limitations with

regard to measuring these site characteristics at subcentimeter
accuracy and with laser amplitudes, newer technology may
already be useful for addressing these limitations. The results
lay out monitoring protocols using current instrumentation
that can be adapted to other instrument platforms and in some
cases, such as monitoring gully thalweg position, achieve a
high degree of accuracy and usefulness for archeological site
stability studies.
Whereas the topographic change results presented herein
provide the highest level of change detection yet performed on
entire archeological sites in Grand Canyon, additional work in
combining these results with site-specific data on weather (for

(for example, O’Brien and Pederson, 2009a,b), and hydrology
and sandbar response (for example, Hazel and others, 2008,
2010) will provide a more thorough understanding of the
causes of the documented topographic changes on these time
scales. This information should provide land managers with an
improved basis for making management decisions regarding
archeological resources in Grand Canyon National Park.
