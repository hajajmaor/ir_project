A Short History
We are pleased to announce that the 4th International Tourism Congress will be held in
Eskisehir, Turkey between October 16 - 19, 2019 and is hosted by Anadolu University.
The theme of the congress will be CITY TOURISM. Urban dimension of tourism has been
scrutinized from different angles notably since the 1990s. Even though ‘tourist cities’ may
not be distinctly demarcated from the other types since cities are multifunctional, tourism
is a salient feature of most cities that penetrates the daily life. Thus, tourism activities
induce a wide range of opportunities and predicaments in cities. Examination of these
relations involves management, planning and marketing practices, and inspection of their
socio-cultural reflections. Therefore, the goal of the congress is to thoroughly examine
contemporary city tourism issues, stimulate dialogue, and develop new perspectives in the
field of tourism within the globalized environment. The congress invites conceptual, empirical,
and methodological research papers, and destination context case studies on different city
tourism themes. Papers and presentations are expected to address both the theoretical,
methodological, and practical aspects of city tourism. As such, the 4th International Tourism
Congress will provide a unique forum for attendees from academia, industry, government,
and other organizations to actively exchange, share, and challenge state-of-the-art research
and cases on city tourism.

Foreword
Hosted by Anadolu University Faculty of Tourism this year, the 20th National Tourism
Congress is a well-established and very important organization that brings together all
the tourism stakeholders of Turkey, ranging from academics to decision-makers, in order
to address issues in both theoretical and sector-related perspectives.
It is also of great importance that this year’s National Tourism Congress coincides with
the period in which the 2023 Tourism Strategy has been announced. In particular, as a
result of the implementation of the tourism strategy in which the sustainable and incomedriven growth model comes to the fore, Turkey is projected to host 75 million tourists in
2023 and to obtain a receipt of 65 billion dollars. In addition, the Turkish Tourism Promotion
and Development Agency, similar to the agency models that have been operating in the
countries with the highest tourism receipts across the world for years, has also launched
its operations. By this means, the promotion of the brand of Turkey will exert a drastic
change and improvement from budget to mentality, media to content.
I do believe that the main theme and sub-themes of this Congress, aligned with the
strategies, goals and operations of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the scientific
studies prepared in this framework will prove to have invaluable contributions to the
achievement of the objectives of Turkey.
I would like to thank the whole administrative staff of Anadolu University hosting
the 20th National Tourism Congress, in particular to Prof. Dr. Şafak Ertan ÇOMAKLI,
the president of the university. Besides, I would like to express my gratitude to all the
academics and scientists, who have contributed to the organization of the Congress and
have taken part in the stages of scientific assessment. I congratulate Prof. Dr. Oktay EMİR,
the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Congress who has put great labours in
the successful realization of such a comprehensive organization, and all the academic and
administrative staff in charge.

Foreword
The history of Eskişehir dates back to the Old and Middle Ages. The ancient sources
refer to our city as a Phrygian city enriched by trade and famous for its hot springs at the
crossroad of important roads
Eskişehir, which came under the rule of the Seljuks since the 12th century, had also
been in an important position for the Ottoman Empire. Karacahisar Castle, the first fortress
conquered by the Ottoman Empire, and Karacaşehir, where the first khutbah was read in the
name of Osman Gazi, the founder of the Ottoman Empire, are within the borders of Eskişehir.
Our City is worth seeing with its three important points; the most important witness
of the city’s rich past with its thousands of years of history, Yazılıkaya Phrygian Valley,
Sivrihisar Ulu Mosque and Odunpazarı Historical City Centre, and with other artifacts in
UNESCO Temporary World Heritage List. Numerous destinations such as Kurşunlu Mosque
and Complex, Eskişehir Modern Museum, Eskişehir Eti Archaeology Museum, Republic
History Museum, Kurtuluş Museum, Esminiatürk, Atlıhan Handicrafts Bazaar, Pessinus
Ancient City, Han Underground City, Seyyid Battal Gazi Complex, Tülomsaş Museum are
waiting for visitors both from Turkey and abroad.
Eskişehir, which has broken new grounds throughout the history such as; the reading
of the first khutbah in the Ottoman Empire (Osman Bey Period), the opening of the first
court of appeal (1923), the establishment of the first agricultural research institute (1925),
the opening of the first village institute (1940), the production of the first Turkish car, called
Revolution, (1961), the production of the first Turkish locomotive, Karakurt, (1961), the
first Open Education Faculty (1982), the city where the first High Speed Train service was
made (2009), the first Capital of Turkish World Culture (2013), the first Intangible Cultural
Heritage Capital (2013) ) and the first National Jet Engine Production (2019), is among the
most visited cities in terms of domestic tourism.
The 20th National Tourism Congress (UTK20) and the 4th International Tourism Congress
(ITC2019) were held together for the first time on 16-19 October 2019 in Eskişehir hosted
by Anadolu University Tourism Faculty. The main theme of the congress was determined
as “City Tourism”. Believing that The 20th National Tourism Congress (UTK20) and the 4th
International Tourism Congress (ITC2019), where sector representatives, leading nongovernmental organizations and tourism academics came together and evaluated the
issues related to city tourism, will have important outcomes on behalf of our city and our
country’s city tourism, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to hosting such
important congresses with the participation of scientists, sector representatives and all
other stakeholders in the tourism sector.

Foreword
As a sub-sector of tourism, which is one of the leading sectors of our country and
the world, city tourism is of great importance both with its attractiveness and with its
strong contribution to the city economy. Therefore, organizing the 20th National Tourism
Congress and the 4th International Tourism Congress with the theme of “city tourism” in
the province of Eskişehir, which has recently attracted considerable attention with its city
tourism, has not only been a great privilege for Eskişehir but also brought remarkable
opportunities for the sector stakeholders and tourism academics.
Anadolu University has always supported the studies and research on city tourism.
As such, our university cooperated closely with the actors of the tourism sector in the city
and developed projects on this subject. Thus, Anadolu University is honored to be the host
of the 20th National Tourism Congress and the 4th International Tourism Congress, which
a large number of national and international tourism academics have attended. These
Congresses are expected to make significant contributions to developing city tourism in
Eskişehir, bringing solutions to problems, bringing the academia and sector stakeholders
together, and shedding light on the subject through new research. I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all the scientists who have participated in both congresses either
as a presenter or audience. I would also like to thank all the academic and administrative
staff of the congress’s advisory, scientific and executive committees.
I wish that the 20th National Tourism Congress and the 4th International Tourism
Congress will be beneficial for the scientific world, Eskişehir, and our country and I hope
that the positive results of these congresses will be seen as soon as possible.

Preface
Distinguished Members of the 20th National and 4th International Tourism Congresses
Family,
We have now completed the 20th of the National Tourism Congress which has played
a privileged role in the development of the Turkish tourism science field. It is our great
pleasure and honor to have the researchers who are wholeheartedly devoted to the field
come together and share information.
The Congress has shed light on the intellectual journey of many scientists over the
past 20 years and continues its mission to contribute to the training of young academics.
To give brief information about both congresses, in addition to the presentation of more
than 250 oral presentations in national and international congresses, a colloquium was
organized in which panels of seven national and international speakers and seven doctoral
dissertations were presented. These figures show that the scientific quality and level of
participation have been very high in the 20th UTK and 4th ITC congresses. As such, as
Anadolu University Tourism Faculty, we are honored to have undertaken the hosting of
the 20th National and the 4th International Tourism Congress held in Eskişehir in 2019.

to work in harmony, has provided significant material and moral support by participating
in the congress process and communicating on behalf of the Ministry. I would like to thank
TÜBİTAK for providing support for the congress events through their 2223-B program.
I would like to thank to Turkish Airlines and the its manager in Eskişehir Mr. Süleyman

would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Salih KUŞLUVAN, who has been in constant communication

make our congresses as best as one can.
Last but not least, I would like to thank our faculty members and administrative staff
who contributed to the organization of the congress for their dedication. We do hope
that the 20th National and 4th International Tourism Congress will make an important

ABSTRACT

T

he purpose of this study is to determine the effects of most important components on the
Tourism income and expenditure of Turkey by the help of Classification Regression Trees
(CR&T). With this purpose, quarterly tourism income and expenditure and type of income and
expenditure data (Thousand $) among the years 2003 and 2018 is obtained from the web site of Turkish
Statistical Institute. Effects of income and Expenditure types (Food and beverage, Accommodation,
Health, Transport (In abroad), Sports education and culture, Tour services, International transport by
foreign Company, GSM roaming, Other goods and services, Clothes and shoes, Souvenirs, Carpet, rug
etc.) on tourism income and expenditure is examined via Classification and regression trees which
are becoming increasingly popular for partitioning data and identifying local structure in small and
large datasets. Classification trees include those models in which the dependent variable (the predicted
variable) is categorical. Regression trees include those in which it is continuous.
The results of the analysis indicate that, while accommodation is the most effective factor on tourism
income, individual expenditures are the most effective factor on tourism expenditure of Turkey. On
the tourism income other effective factors are determined as Food and beverage, Clothes and shoes,
other goods and services and Transport. Accommodation and package tour expenses are also found
significant on the tourism expenses of Turkey. Detailed results are given in the related tables and figures.
Key Words: Tourism Income, Tourism Expenditure, Classification Regression Tree.

INTRODUCTION
The contribution of the tourism industry (in terms of income generation, employment, etc.) can be very
significant for the economy of a country (Armstrong and Read, 2000). Hence, the development of tourism
has usually been considered as a positive contribution to economic growth (Khan et al, 1995; Lee and Kwon,
1995).Furthermore, Dritsakis (2004) proposes the view that the contribution of tourism to a country’s
economy is multifaceted, affecting its exchange rate, as well as different sectors of the economy such as
the employment sector(by reducing the propensity to emigrate), the business sector (as it has to develop
in order to meet the increasing tourist market), the income sector(in its contribution to aggregate income
and the importance of the multiplier effect), the cultural sector (by improving the living standards of the
people) and the fiscal sector (as tourism activities yield income to the public sector). Numerous studies
have shown that tourism income can lead to economic growth via increased01
employment, income and tax
revenues (Croes and Vanegas, 2006; Vanegas and Croes, 2003; Sugiyarto et al, 2002; Page, 1999; Uysal and
Gitelson, 1994; West, 1993; Khan et al, 1990). These findings tend to support the tourism-led economic
growth (TLEG) hypothesis (Eeckels et al, 2012)

LITERATURE REVIEW
Tourist expenditure behavior is defined as a system with complex interactions (Abbruzzo, Brida, & Scuderi,
2014), which involves a complex process of individual decision-making (Olya & Al-ansi, 2018).Specifically,
complexity arises from the fact that travel decision-making involves multiple decisions around the various
elements of the vacation, which are highly influenced by situational factors, such as personality, attitude,
brand preference, perception, cognition, and market segmentation (Belk, 1974; Cohen, Prayag, & Moital,
2014). Furthermore, expenditures cover the purchase of both tangible/visible items (e.g. transportation
costs) and intangible items (e.g. emotional), products and services which may be interrelated (Brida &
Scuderi, 2013; Laesser & Crouch, 2006; Mehran and Olya, 2018).
The link between expenditure on the tourism industry and its economic growth has attracted considerable
interest from economic researchers, at both theoretical and empirical levels. The overall view is that the
tourism industry may require major investments in basic infrastructure such as transport, accommodation,
water supply and health care. Sinclair (1998) points out that countries potentially benefit from increasing
expenditures on tourism. The Keynesian approach supports the thesis that public and private expenditure
on the tourism industry is an important policy tool to ensure a reasonable level of economic activity, correct
short-term cyclical fluctuations in aggregate expenditure (Singh and Sahni, 1984) and secure an increase in
productive investment, thus providing socially optimal direction for growth and development (Ram, 1986),
especially by a simultaneous increase in short- and long-term revenues. It is argued that delay in developing
the tourism industry will adversely affect the country’s economic growth and employment levels (Dallas,
2001). Looking now at the econometric modeling, the long-run relationship between public expenditure
and real output (as in the case of transportation and communication expenses) – that is, the ability of public
expenditure to influence national income – is examined on two levels: the nature of the causality pattern
and the output implications of expenditure (Louca, 2006).
The aim of this study is to determine the effects of most important components on the Tourism income
and expenditure of Turkey by the help of CR&T analysis.

MATERIAL AND METHOD
To analyze the important factors on tourism income and expenditure of Turkey, the data set (in Thousand
$) among the years 2003 and 2018 is obtained from the web site of Turkish Statistical Institute. The data set
for the Tourism income is compiled from “Tourism Income by Type of Expenditure” from the Departing
Visitors Statistics and for the Tourism expenditure is compiled from “Tourism Expenses by Type of
Expenditure” from the Arriving Citizens Statistics. The data is quarterly for all income, expenditure and the
other types of expenditures.
The data come from questionnaires which are applied to residing abroad citizens, foreigners with face to
face interview, four times every year. Sample size of survey is calculated by using quota sampling method. The
survey is done with face to face interview. Statistical analyses are performed via SPSS software.
CRT is a recursive partitioning method to be used both for regression and classification. CRT is
constructed by splitting subsets of the data set using all predictor variables to create two child nodes
repeatedly, beginning with the entire data set. The best predictor is chosen using a variety of impurity
or diversity measures (Gini, towing, ordered towing and least-squared deviation). The goal is to produce
subsets of the data which are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable (Lewis, 2000;
Alkhasawneh et al, 2014)
Classification and regression trees are becoming increasingly popular for partitioning data and
identifying local structure in small and large datasets. Classification trees include those models in which
the dependent variable (the predicted variable) is categorical. Regression trees include those in which it is
continuous (Wilkinson, 1992)
Unlike classical regression techniques for which the relationship between the response and predictors
is pre-specified (for example, straight line, quadratic) and the test is performed to prove or disprove the
relationship, RTA assumes no such relationship. It is primarily a method of constructing a set of decision
rules on the predictor variables (Breiman al. 1984; Verbyla 1987; Clark and Pregibon 1992). The rules
are constructed by recursively partitioning the data into successively smaller groups with binary splits
based on a single predictor variable. Splits for all of the predictors are examined by an exhaustive search
procedure and the best split is chosen. For regression trees, the selected split is the one that maximizes the

2

homogeneity of the two resulting groups with respect to the response variable (the split that maximizes the
between-groups sum of squares, as in analysis of variance, although other options may be available. The
output is a tree diagram with the branches determined by the splitting rules and a series of terminal nodes
that contain the mean response (Prasad et al, 2006).
Definitions of the variables used in the analysis are also given in below. All these definitions are obtained
from the meta data explanations of Turkish statistical institute.
Tourism Income: Tourism income is defined as the total individual and package tour expenditures made
in Turkey by foreigner and citizen visitors resident in abroad (excluding real estate expenditures, repairmaintenance expenses for residences, durables, transfers etc.). Tourism income includes the expenditure on
food and beverages, accommodation, health, transportation in Turkey, sports, education, culture, international
transportation with Turkish firms, mobile phone roaming expenditures, marina service expenditures,
souvenirs etc.
Tourism Expenditure: Tourism expenditures are defined as the total individual and package tour
expenditures (food and beverages, accommodation, health, transportation, sports, education, culture,
international transportation by foreign firms, mobile phone roaming expenditures, souvenirs etc.) made
in abroad by a citizen visitors resident in Turkey (excluding real estate expenditures, repair-maintenance
expenses for residences, durables etc.)
Individual expenditures for Tourism income is defined as; the total consumption expenditure made
by a visitor or on behalf of a visitor for and during his/her trip except package tour expenditures, commercial
and investment expenditure and the cash given to relatives.
Individual expenditures for Tourism expenditure is defined as; all expenditure in the place visited
by visitor or on behalf of visitor during trip except package tour expenditures, commercial and investment
expenditure and the cash given to relatives.
Type of Expenditure for Tourism income is defined as the expenditures of visitors made in Turkey
for food and beverage, accommodation, health, transport (inside Turkey), sports, education, culture, tour
services, international transportation by Turkish company, mobile phone roaming, marina service, clothes
and shoes, souvenirs, carpet, rug, other expenditures (like individual care, gold, silver).
Type of Expenditure for Tourism expenditure is also defined as that citizens make expenditures in
abroad as food and beverage, accommodation, health, transport (in abroad), sports, education, culture,
tour services, international transportation by foreign company, mobile phone roaming, clothes and shoes,
souvenirs, carpet, rug, other expenditures.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Results of the CR&T analysis for the tourism income of Turkey is given in Figure 1. Figure 1 indicates that
accommodation has the greatest effect on the tourism income of Turkey than the other factors (types of
expenditure).

Figure 1. CR&T results for tourism income of Turkey.

According to CRT analysis, accommodation expenses are divided into two subgroups. For the first
group, while the accommodation expense is equal or less than 772113 $ food and beverage expenses have
found the effective variable (factor) for the food and beverage expenses which are more than 943876 $, other
goods and services has a significant effect. Within this group equal or less than 1279639 $ expense of other
goods and services, expenses for transport found the effective factor on the tourism income of Turkey. For
this group tourism income mean of turkey is 4471639$ for the less or equal Transport expenses of 344295$.
Additionally, for the food and beverage expenses which are less or equal than 943876$, clothes and shoes
has significant effect. In this group, tourism income mean of Turkey is 2265318$ for the less or equal than
clothes and shoes expenses of 353261$. Within the same group, while clothes and shoes expenses more
than 353261$, tourism income mean of Turkey is 3725173$. For the second group, while accommodation
expense is more than 772113$, food and beverage expense has found the effective factor. For the food and
beverage expenses which are less or equal than 1982267$, clothes and shoes has an important effect on the
tourism income. For this group, while expenses of shoes and clothes less or equal than 841579$, tourism
income mean of Turkey is 7123493$ and while it more than 841579$, tourism income mean of Turkey is
8584431$.

Results of the CR&T analysis for the tourism expenditure of Turkey is given in Figure 2. Figure 2shows that
individual expenditures has the significant effect on the tourism expenditure of Turkey than the other factors.

Figure 2. CR&T results for tourism expenditure of Turkey.

According to CRT analysis, individual expenses are divided into two groups. While individual
expenditures expenses are equal or less than 902740$, individual expenditures has found an important
variable. In this group, tourism expenditure mean of Turkey is 749408$ for the less or equal individual
expenditures expenses of 812869$. In addition to this, while tourism expenditures expenses more than
812869$, tourism expenditure mean of Turkey is 999813$. While individual01
expenditures are more than
902740$, accommodation expenses has found efficient variable. For the accommodation expenses which
are less or equal than 253020$, package of tour expenditure expenses has an important effect on the tourism
expenditure of Turkey. For this group, while package of tour expenditure expenses are less or equal than
147712$, tourism expenditure mean of Turkey is 1125598$. Moreover, for the accommodation expenses is
more than 253020$, tourism expenditure mean of turkey is 1301863$.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
According to the results of many studies, it can be expected that (tourism) services have an income elasticity
of demand greater than 1, so that, as real income increases, real tourism services will grow at a faster
rate than the proportional growth in income (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980; Fuchs, 1968; Inman, 1985).
Thus (tourism) services consume an increasing share of national income and (all else being equal) national
employment as well. Explanations can be based on structural change: After being saturated in terms of
basic needs and durable goods, a growing economy has more money left over for travel and leisure goods
(consumed in the usual environment) as well as for other luxury goods (Gunter and Smeral, 2016).
In earlier studies researchers especially consider the tourist arrivals/departures and expenditures/
receipts or tourism demand as the dependent variable. Even much of the variables are same with the earlier
studies, they examined the effects of independent variables on the dependent variable such as regression
analyses, panel data analyses and etc. In this study, one of the multivariable and visual statistical analyze
CRT is used the determine the effects of similar independent variables on tourism income and expenditure.
The results of the analysis indicate that, while accommodation is the most effective factor on tourism
income, individual expenditures are the most effective factor on tourism expenditure of Turkey. On the
tourism income other effective factors are determined as Food and beverage, Clothes and shoes, other
goods and services and Transport. Accommodation and package tour expenses are also found significant
on the tourism expenses of Turkey.
Considering these effective variables on tourism income and expenditures and foreseeing the future
values of these variables should be much helpful to the country’s economy and it may also help to prepare
the future tourism politics of the country.

ABSTRACT

T

urkey’s economy in terms of increased tourism revenues or tourism income/expenditure has a
quite significant impact. When the country is stuck in terms of foreign exchange, tourism sector
plays a major role in the economy in eliminating foreign exchange inflow, unemployment and
import/export deficits. Also, as well as tourism income, tourism expenditures are also very important in
our country. Forecasting the tourism income and expenditures of a country may lead the administrators
to take some precautions for any unexpected situations in country’s economy and future tourism
investments.

Artificial neural networks (ANN), which have been very popular within the researchers in recent years,
are simply an information processing technique based on the biological nerve cells (neurons). Just
like in the human brain, there are links between nerve cells. When these bonds are connected to each
other, an artificial neural network is formed. ANN is used in many areas such as statistics, medicine,
quality control and etc. in recent years. One of the most important reasons that attracted the attention
of researchers is the ability to learn, generalize and solve a problem such as a human being.
The aim of this study is to forecasting the tourism income and expenditures of Turkey via artificial neural
network approach. With this purpose the quarterly data set for the tourism income and expenditures
of Turkey between the years 2003-2018 is obtained from the web page of Turkish statistical institute.
The forecasted value of the first quarter of 2019 is compared with the real value. The performances of
the predicted values were calculated according to MAPE criteria. The results of the study indicates that
forecasts are closer to the real values. Detailed results are also given in related tables and figures.
Keywords: Tourism Income, Tourism Expenditure, Artificial Neural Network.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the academic community has shown considerable interest in the relationship between
tourism and economic growth. These studies strive to empirically investigate the significance of the socalled
tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) supporting a direct effect from tourism activity to growth and
suggesting in general that tourism increases foreign exchange income, creates employment opportunities,
and therefore triggers overall economic growth. This hypothesis derives directly from the export-led
growth hypothesis (ELGH) which states that the economic growth of countries can be generated not
only by increasing the amount of labour and capital within the economy, but also by expanding exports
(Georgantopoulos 2012).
Measures of international tourism volume and international tourism expenditures are both important
for a destination. Forecasts of tourist volume in the form of arrivals are important for private suppliers of
tourism services to plan their operations, and for destinations to foresee infrastructure and superstructure
development needs (Sheldon 1993).
Understanding tourist expenditure is critically important because “tourism is an expenditure-driven
economic activity” and “the consumption of tourism is at the centre of the economic measurement of
tourism and the foundation of the economic impacts of tourism” (Mihalic 2002, Wang and Davidson 2010).

Tourism today carries not only sociocultural and
political significance but also provides considerable
economic benefits. In the 20th century, tourism has
emerged as one of the largest and the fastest growing
industries in the global economy (Eadington
and Redman 1991). For many countries, tourism
expenditure has become an important source of
business activity, income, employment and foreign
exchange (Lee et al, 1996). Today tourism has
become a much more important opportunity for any
government. Authorities orientate their economies
to gain more tourism income (Aydın 2016).

LITERATURE REVIEW
Previous literature between tourism (and its
components; accommodation, package travel, food
and drinks, transport, sporting activities, shopping)
and economic growth, although various measures
of tourism activity have been employed (e.g. total
tourism expenditure, tourism arrivals, international
visitor consumption, domestic tourism expenditure),
suggests that tourism is a key factor for economic
growth especially for the cases of low income and/or
small countries (Georgantopoulos 2012).
The literature review of research into tourism
forecasting shows that researchers have used a variety
of methods in forecasting tourism demand. These
methods include simple time series extrapolative
methods such as exponential smoothing, ARIMA
models, complex econometric models, combined
models, and artificial intelligence methods. Of note
throughout the literature review is that researchers
state that no single model outperforms others in all
cases (Benjamin et al, 2018).
Tourists’ incomes are used in different forms
such as gross national product (GNP) (Garín-Muñoz
and Amaral 2000; Qui and Zhang 1995; Ongan et al.
2017), gross domestic product (GDP) (Kulendran
and Wilson 2000; Lathiras and Siriopoulos 1998;
Ongan et al. 2017), GDP per capita (Dritsakis 2004;
Hor 2015; Pivˇcevi´c et al. 2016; Ongan et al. 2017),
and the industrial production index (IPI) (Espinoza
et al. 2012; González and Moral 1995; Seo et al. 2009;
Chang et al. 2017; Ongan et al. 2017).
The income variable has been most commonly
included in demand models as a major determinant
of tourism demand (Uysal and Crompton 1984).
Demand theory implies that as per capita incomes
rise, more people are likely to travel, and tourist
expenditures are a positive function of income.
Both hypotheses have been supported by a host of
empirical studies (Artus 1972; Barry and O’Hagan
1972; Gray 1966; Jud and Joseph 1974; Kwack 1972;
Laber 1969; Loeb 1982; Stronge and Redman 1982).

These studies also found that the income variable
is generally highly elastic, indicating that tourism
expenditures rise at a more rapid percentage rate
than income (Lee et al, 1996).
Time series is a general problem of great
practical interest in many disciplines. Because it
allows you to discover, with some margin of error,
the future values of a series from its past values. In
the relevant literature there have been numerous
successful applications in different fields, such as
the economy, finance and hydrology (Tealab 2018).
Box and Jenkins (Chen and Chang 2009), in
the late 70s, made an important work in studying
applications composed of mathematical linear
models. These models represent Autoregressive (AR)
and Moving Averages (MA) processes. While in the
AR processes it is assumed that the current value
of the time series is a linear combination of its past
values. Processes in the MA are supposed that the
current value is a function of random interference
passes or perturbations that have affected the series.
Many practical experiments have demonstrated
that this approach makes it possible to represent
the dynamics of many real time series. That class
models is popularized in both the academic and
professional fields (Tealab 2018).
However, it has also been found that many real
time series seem to follow non-linear behavior and
the approach of Box and Jenkins is insufficient to
represent their dynamics (Clements et al. 2004,
Granger and Tersvirta 1993). Thus in the most
relevant literature have been presented a wide
range of models that suggest different mathematical
representations of the non-linearity present in the
data (Granger and Tersvirta 1993, Tersvirta 1994),
such as the models based on schemes (Granger
and Tersvirta 1993) and different types of ANN
(Anders and Korn 1999, Zhang et al. 1998). Some
other literature reviews focused on one type of
forecasting, one-step or multistep ahead forecasting,
and comparing the proposed strategies in theoretical
and practical terms (Taieb et al. 2012, Tealab 2018).
In conventional time series analysis two main
approaches, which are separate but not necessarily
mutually exclusive, have been used. One of them
performs the analysis in the frequency domain,
sometimes termed spectral analysis because of
its theoretical justification based on the spectral
representation (Cramer 1942; Cramer and
01
Leadbetter 1967) of a stationary process. In time
series, in fact, repetitive cycle, that is, the frequency
with which the series varies, is of special interest.
The estimation of the power spectral density, or
simply the power spectrum that gives the power
corresponding to the rate of oscillation expressed in

9

cycles per unit time, provides a frequency-domain description of second-order statistics of the process. The
other performs the analysis on the time domain by which we mean that one postulates some parametric
model, and the data are fitted to this model by estimating the parameters. Among many models, general
linear models such as an autoregressive process model are preferred because of its simplicity in estimating
the parameters and forecasting the future. The parametric modeling of stationary time series can be
accomplished by well-established parameter estimation techniques, such as least squares and maximum
likelihood. The use of the maximum likelihood estimator for parameter estimation can be justified (Box
and Jenkins 1970) for large data records on the basis of its asymptotic unbiased and minimum variance
properties (Lee and Jung 2019).

MATERIAL AND METHODS
To analyze the important factors on tourism income and expenditure of Turkey, the data set (in Thousand
$) among the years 2003 and 2018 is obtained from the web site of Turkish Statistical Institute. The data set
for the Tourism income is compiled from “Tourism Income by Type of Expenditure” from the Departing
Visitors Statistics and for the Tourism expenditure is compiled from “Tourism Expenses by Type of
Expenditure” from the Arriving Citizens Statistics. The data is quarterly for all income, expenditure and the
other types of expenditures.
The data, come from questionnaires which are applied to residing abroad citizens, foreigners with face
to face interview, four times every year. Sample size of survey is calculated by using quota sampling method.
The survey is done with face to face interview. Statistical analyses are performed via MATLAB software.
While constructing an artificial neural network model, as in other time series analyzes, there is no need
to go into any stationary way. Because of the structure of ANN, stationary process takes place automatically
in the learning stage. Also, since the data set shows a seasonal distribution, it would be correct to select the
delay value between 1 and 4, and 1 delay was used for the study.
When the creation of ANN was initiated, the data was firstly divided to measure the performance of the
network. Accordingly, the data; 70% training, 15% validation and 15% testing.
There are various types of artificial neural networks. Feed forward neural networks are one of these
types. The structure of multilayer feed forward artificial neural networks is basically given in Figure 1. The
architecture as illustrated in the figure consists of three parts such as input, hidden, and output layers. Each
layer consists of neurons. The architecture structure is determined based on deciding the number of neuron
in each layer. These neurons are linked each other by weights. There is no link among the neurons in the
same layer (Egrioglu et al. 2013).

Figure 1. Multilayer feed forward artificial neural networks with one output neuron

When determining the architecture of the network, 4 different architectures were tried. Experiments
were also made between 1 and 10 to determine the number of hidden layers. As a result, the architecture
with the lowest error was chosen as the architecture in Figure 2. multilayer and feedforward networks were
used for the architectural structure.

There are many learning algorithms for ANN training. These networks have different properties according
to each other. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used for this study. Because this algorithm requires a
second order derivative, it works faster than other first order derivative algorithms. The LM algorithm update
derived from steepest descent and Newton algorithms is given in (1) DYXġOXet al. 2012):
w=(J T J + μ I )1 J T e

(1)

w is the weight vector, I unit matrix, μ combination coefficient. J (PxM) xN size Jacobian matrix, e
(PxM) x1 shows the error vector. P shows the number of training samples, M shows the number of outputs
and N shows the number of weights. μ is an adjustable parameter. If this parameter is too large, the method
behaves like the Newtonian method if it is too small as the vertical descent method. An adaptive structure
for this parameter is given in (2) DYXġOXet al. 2012):
μ (n – 1)k, 
μ (n)= 

μ (n – 1 / k,

E(n) > E(n – 1)
E(n)  E(n – 1)

(2)

In equation (2), k is a fixed number. E indicates the suitability value.
The parameters used in the formation of the network, such as the combining function and the transfer
function, were found by means of the trial and error path. Weighted total formula is used for the combining
function. There is no study on transfer function in the literature about which function is better. Sigmoid
Function, Purelin Function and Tansig Function were tested. Sigmoid Function was chosen as the transfer
function because the most suitable result for the data structure was given by Sigmoid Function. The
estimation values obtained through the generated network are given in the other section.
Definitions of the variables used in the analysis are also given in below. All these definitions are obtained
from the meta data explanations of Turkish statistical institute.
Tourism Income: Tourism income is defined as the total individual and package tour expenditures
made in Turkey by foreigner and citizen visitors resident in abroad (excluding real estate expenditures,
repair-maintenance expenses for residences, durables, transfers etc.). Tourism income includes the
expenditure on food and beverages, accommodation, health, transportation in Turkey, sports, education,
culture, international transportation with Turkish firms, mobile phone roaming expenditures, marina
service expenditures, souvenirs etc.
Tourism Expenditure: Tourism expenditures are defined as the total individual and package tour
expenditures (food and beverages, accommodation, health, transportation, sports, education, culture,
international transportation by foreign firms, mobile phone roaming expenditures, souvenirs etc.) made
in abroad by a citizen visitors resident in Turkey (excluding real estate expenditures, repair-maintenance
expenses for residences, durables etc.)
“Individual expenditures” for Tourism income is defined as the total consumption expenditure
made by a visitor or on behalf of a visitor for and during his/her trip except package tour expenditures,
commercial and investment expenditure and the cash given to relatives.
“Individual expenditures” for Tourism expenditure is defined as; all expenditure
in the place visited
01
by visitor or on behalf of visitor during trip except package tour expenditures, commercial and investment
expenditure and the cash given to relatives.
“Type of Expenditure” for Tourism income is defined as the expenditures of visitors made in Turkey
for food and beverage, accommodation, health, transport (inside Turkey), sports, education, culture, tour
services, international transportation by Turkish company, mobile phone roaming, marina service, clothes
and shoes, souvenirs, carpet, rug, other expenditures (like individual care, gold, silver).

“Type of Expenditure” for Tourism expenditure is also defined that citizens make expenditures in
abroad as food and beverage, accommodation, health, transport (in abroad), sports, education, culture,
tour services, international transportation by foreign company, mobile phone roaming, clothes and shoes,
souvenirs, carpet, rug, other expenditures.
The performance of the model created by ANN was measured according to Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE) criteria. The RMSE is calculated as in (3):

When Table 1 is examined, it can be seen that the ANN model is under the effect of seasonal fluctuations.
In addition, the results indicate that, estimations of tourism income are closer to the real values. (Actual
value = 4629679,12, while the ANN estimate = 4485943,86). The graph of real and estimated tourism
income values are also given in Figure 3.
As a result of statistical analysis, ANN estimated values and actual tourism expenditure values are given

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
As it is mentioned in earlier sections of this study, tourism income and expenditures are important
indicators of economy for any country. Any information of these indicators for the future may also help
the government to make provisions against any unexpected situation. At that point as obtaining errorless

14

data, using the correct variables and choosing the correct statistical analysis is also much important. In this
it was not possible to interfere the data set and the variables, however estimations of the related time series
are done by ANN which is one of the most effective time series analyzing method.
Because of the efficiency on estimating the time series of ANN, this method became much popular in
recent years. Even there are many time series analyzing methods, this technique power of this technique is
also related with using the pre information of related data set. At that point it can be recommended to the
researchers to obtain the forecasts of any time series about tourism via ANN.

ABSTRACT

W

ith win-win policy in the context of accessible Tourism it is possible, on the one hand, to
spread tourism to 12 months, to increase employment, to increase occupancy-income rates
and to make tourism activities sustainable, and on the other hand, to enable people with
disabilities to integrate with the society by eliminating the legal, socio-cultural, environmental and
economic barriers for them. The aim of this study is to determine the readiness of accommodation
enterprises for accessible tourism by profiling the academic studies in related to “the point of view of
accommodation enterprises towards disabled tourism”. For this purpose, scientific studies which are
related to the perspective of the accommodation enterprises to accessible tourism from 2006 to the
present; articles in the database of Ulakbim, proceedings which are published in congress books in
the Google Scholarly Database and graduate theses which are registered at the National Thesis Center
on the website of the Council of Higher Education, have been evaluated within the framework of the
parameters such as publication year, research subject, domestic resource. In the light of the findings,
it was observed that the managers of the accommodation enterprises were interested in the subject of
accessible tourism, but they did not have sufficient knowledge and awareness, and legal, structural and
organizational arrangements are not possessed in the accommodation enterprises adequately.
Keywords: Disability, Accessibility, Accessible Tourism, Accommodation Enterprises

INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization Report (WHO 2011) estimates that more than one billion people in the
world population of 2010, in other words, approximately 15 percent of the world’s population, suffer from
any kind of disability. This number and ratio is increasing day by day. Legal, structural and administrative
arrangements are being made in order to ensure that the increasing population of people with disabilities is
able to live like other people in society. Together with these regulations, especially in developed countries,
social and economic supports provided for the purpose of integrating the disabled people to the society
instead of assimilating them have started to provide touristic travel and accommodation activities like the
other healthy people of the society.
It has made significant improvements in the social and economic opportunities for the disabled in
Turkey. Hospitality industry is one of the major subsystems of the tourism industry of Turkey. According
01(investment and operation
to the data of 2019 (KTB 2019), the number of rooms with accommodation
certificate) within the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has reached 569.886 and the number of beds
has reached 1.200.122 units. However, there are various legal, structural and managerial barriers and
deficiencies about accessibility in tourism in hospitality enterprises. According to the Turkey Disability
Studies conducted by Turkey Statistical Institute (TSI) in 2002 was reported to be 12.29% rate of disability
in Turkey. As of 2018, the population of Turkey is considered to exceed 82 million, it is understood that the
number of disabled people exceeded 10 million, according to this rate. Accordingly, given that 10 million

17

4th International Tourism Congress

people with disabilities only 5700 rooms designed in
accommodation enterprises in Turkey, it is seen that
1754 disabled people have one disabled room.
In the context of accessible tourism, as well as
determining the needs, problems, expectations and
ways of solution of the disabled that represent the
demand side, it is also important to determine the
point of view of the accommodation enterprises
that provide hospitality services to disabled people
and are among the units represent the supply
side. This study, which reveals the perspectives
of accommodation enterprises managers on
accessible tourism, is thought to make significant
contributions to literature of accessible tourism
and the related public institutions, particularly the
Ministry of Culture and Tourism, in the decisionmaking processes related to accessible tourism.

LITERATUR REVIEW
According to the World Health Organization,
disability is a part of human condition. Everyone
will be temporarily or permanently weakened
at a certain point in their lives, and for many
years people will face increasing difficulties in
performing their functions. Disability is complex
and interventions that overcome the disadvantages
associated with disability are multiple and systemic
and vary in context (WHO 2011). Disability is a
multidimensional structure, each dimension has its
own access requirement and they differ significantly
from one another. In this context, multi-dimensional
structures; mobility, hearing, vision, cognitive /
mental health, hidden sensitivities and long-term
health conditions are accepted by disability statistics
(Buhalis and Darcy 2011).
Accessibility is closely related to universal
design, the process of creating products that can be
used by people with the widest range of capabilities,
operating in the widest possible range of areas. Darcy
(1998) divides accessibility into three dimensions as
physical, sensory and communicative access. In this
context, it can be said that accessibility in tourism
and travel depends on three factors. These are the
capacity of people with disabilities to transport
and travel, the capacity to communicate, and the
availability of opportunities and activities.
Accessible tourism, whose main component
is people with disabilities, is defined as a form of
tourism involving cooperation processes among the
stakeholders that enable people with access needs,
including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive
dimensions, to operate independently, equally and
respectably through the provision and delivery
of universally designed tourism products and

18

services (Buhalis and Darcy 2011). The accessible
tourism approach requires cooperation between the
stakeholders in supply and demand. The availability
of infrastructure and accessible tourism enterprises
is important for destination choices of disabled
tourists wishing to participate in tourism activities.
Although the preferred destination is accessible,
disabled tourists can change destination preferences
or cancel their travel if they cannot find suitable
accommodation facilities, particularly suitable
accommodation facilities, for indoor and outdoor
accessibility. As can be seen, accommodation
enterprises are located in the center of accessible
tourism activities. In a tourism destination where
accommodation services are not accessible, it is
not possible to implement a sustainable accessible
tourism in universal design.
In this theoretical study, it is aimed to reveal
bibliometric profile of the studies within the
framework of various parameters in the years
between 2006-2019 in the tourism literature in
Turkey to reveal and evaluate the perspective of
accommodation enterprises towards disabled
tourists and accessible tourism. For this purpose,
postgraduate theses, papers presented in scientific
congresses and articles in local tourism journals,
which are registered in the internet address of
the Higher Education Council, were examined in
terms of some bibliometric parameters (year of
publication, subject of study, national research).

METHOD
Zencir and Kozak (2012) stated that bibliometric
analysis is a method used to reveal the scientific
performance of academic institutions, and for this
purpose, the profile of articles on tourism in the
journals published by Social Science Institutes.
Similarly, in this study, it covers domestic studies on
the perspectives of hospitality enterprises towards
disabled tourism. For this purpose, the studies
published in the period of 2006-2019 revealing the
perspectives of accommodation enterprises towards
tourism are searched. As a result of the researches,
graduate theses, papers and articles were obtained
with the keywords, “disabled tourism”, “accessible
tourism” and “accommodation enterprises”, with 4
theses master, 5 papers and 6 articles were included
in the research. The year of publication, the subject
of study, the publication language and the Turkish
language of the study are the determined parameters.
The contents of the parameters can be explained as
follows.
Year of publication: This parameter defines the
academic studies published between 2006-2019.

The subject of study: In this parameter, it
refers to the academic studies conducted on the
perspectives of accommodation processes towards
disabled tourism.
Work area: Research subjects of national studies
conducted to determine whether they are ready for
the disabled tourist accommodation enterprises in
Turkey were examined.

FINDING AND DISCUSSION
The academic studies examined were analyzed
with research methods, working groups (sample)
and data collection techniques and their findings
are presented below. When the studies of the last
thirteen years are examined in Table 1, it is seen
that the quantitative method is predominant and
the qualitative method is in the minority between
2006-2019. Between 2006-2019, there were a total of
15 academic studies, including 5 presented papers, 4
graduate theses and 6 articles, which were included
in the study in accordance with the criteria. Twelve
of the studies were carried out quantitatively, 2 were
qualitative and 2 were mixed methods. Survey,
semi-structured interview and interview studies are
among the general data collection methods.
The results of the systematic analysis of the
academic studies on accessible tourism, disabled
tourism and accommodation enterprises are
presented in Table 2. In general academic studies
(papers, articles, graduate thesis), it is revealed that
accessible tourism is given wide coverage by the
manager, the operator or by the enterprise. Another
finding that emerges as a result of systematic analysis
is the fact that studies on people with disabilities in
demand for disabled tourism are in the minority.
In the academic studies conducted between
2006-2019 (papers, articles, graduate thesis), the
information obtained in accordance with the
opinions of business executives about accessible
tourism are as follows:
t Hospitality managers have a positive
perspective on accessible tourism, but they do
not have sufficient knowledge and experience.
According to the inferences obtained from the
studies on the regulations of accessible (disabled)
tourism, the point of view of the accommodation
business owner / managers towards accessible
tourism or the studies on disabled market awareness,
it is understood that cities and accommodation
enterprises are not fully ready for disabled tourism.
It is seen that many business owners or managers
do not have sufficient information on this subject

and although the disabled tourism market is seen
as an important market, they are not fully aware of
this market. In addition, while it is understood that
managers’ attitudes towards people with disabilities
are positive, they do not have enough information
and awareness about accessible tourism.
t Accommodation establishments are not ready
for accessible tourism for legal, structural and
administrative reasons.
Made in a systematic review results, accessible
accommodation establishments in Turkey (disabled)
tourism, legal, structural and managerial aspects
have emerged they are not ready yet. Although
accommodation establishments comply with legal
regulations, according to the legal regulations
of developed countries, they are inadequate to
provide quality services to people with disabilities.
In addition to legal regulations, accommodation
establishments are structurally far from meeting the
needs of people with disabilities in terms of both
indoor and outdoor arrangements. In addition, they
do not have sufficient managerial information on
how to provide services to people with disabilities
because they do not have training and certification
systems on accessible tourism.
t Most hospitality managers do not have
sufficient awareness of the importance of the
accessible tourism market.
The number of people with disabilities who have
a disability for any reason is increasing rapidly as the
life span of people increases. There is a tremendous
capacity for people with disabilities to participate in
tourism activities all over the world. In this context,
it is seen that the managers of accommodation
establishments do not have sufficient knowledge
and awareness about the place and importance of
accessible tourism in sustainable tourism.
t ćFTFSWŔDFTQSPWŔEFEUPQFPQMFXŔUIEŔTBCŔMŔUŔFT
in accommodation establishments are not
sufficient.
The service provided to disabled people in
accommodation establishments is perceived only
for the use of rooms and therefore most of the
arrangements are directed to the disabled room.
While disabled people should be able to benefit from
independent and equal accommodation activities
without being dependent on anyone, it is seen that
all spaces, both indoors and outdoors, are designed
without considering 01
disabled people. It is stated
that there are no regulations in accordance with the
universal design for the comfortable use of people
with disabilities in restaurants, pools, gardens and
beaches.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATION
In the definition of the United Nations, there
are many physical, social, cultural and economic
barriers to the participation of people with
disabilities to the tourism activities, which are
defined as the largest and special minority of the
world. In the line with the studies investigating the
perspectives of the accommodation enterprises to
the accessible tourism, the things that should be
done for the accommodation enterprises to be ready
for accessible tourism can be summarized as follows:
t Accessible legal and structural arrangements
with universal design should be made.
Existing accommodation establishments should
be made in compliance with new regulations and
accessibility standards and new facilities should
be designed according to these standards (Uslu,
2019: 98). In line with the legal regulations on the
rights of people with disabilities, regulations and
improvements should be made in the legal legislation
taking into consideration universal designs. The
accommodation enterprises in Turkey should go
to an arrangement for increasing the number of
rooms designed for disabled guests and increase
the number of available handicapped rooms should
be provided (Bulgan, 2014: 172; John, 2018: 148;
Attack, 2008: 71).
While determining the arrangements to be
made, not only people with physical disabilities, but
also people with disabilities with visual, hearing,
speech and other types of disabilities should be taken
into consideration (Burak, 2018; 148). According to
the managers of accommodation establishments,
the biggest expectation of the disabled from the
accommodation establishments is the arrangements
for the disabled (Kırlar, 2013: 191). First of all,
improvements should be made in the legal legislation
in our country in the light of the legal regulations
of the modern world regarding the rights of people
with disabilities. However, the regulations required
for disabled people in accommodation enterprises
should be reviewed and expanded in accordance
with international standards (Eryilmaz, 2010; 118).
t Accommodation establishments that meet
accessible tourism criteria should be given a
Disabled Friendly Accommodation Certificate.
In order to encourage tourism enterprises,
the Ministry of Culture and Tourism may issue
a “Disabled Friendly Accommodation Facility”
certificate to enterprises that have structural
designs according to universal standards for the
disabled.Enterprises can increase their share in
the disabled tourism market and thus our country

20

by introducing themselves in both domestic and
foreign markets with this certificate (Eryılmaz,
2010: 119).The certificate application can be used
to indicate the difference between accommodation
enterprises and other accommodation enterprises
that provide services to disabled guests according
to universal standards. Accommodation companies
that make investments for people with disabilities
who are sensitive to universal values and comply
with universal rules and who are deemed eligible
for certification should also benefit from privileges
such as tax relief and incentives (Uslu, 2019: 98;
Eryılmaz, 2010; 119). In addition, accommodation
establishments should be sensitive about providing
quality services for disabled people and should
provide accurate and complete information about
the services they offer (Burak, 2018: 148).
t Certified and applied in-service and out-ofservice trainings should be provided to staff on
accessible tourism.
Psychologically and physiologically, people with
disabilities are more sensitive than healthy people.
The wrong attitude and behavior towards them will
not only make these people unhappy, but will also
negatively affect their level of satisfaction with the
enterprise. In this context, informative trainings
should be given about accessible tourism in order to
raise the awareness of accommodation enterprises
managers about disabled tourism (Uslu, 2019: 98).
Persons with accessible tourism education certificate
should be employed. For these reasons, theoretical
and practical training on how to treat disabled
guests should be added to in-service and out-ofservice training programs. However, as stated above,
business employees should be composed of trained
personnel who are familiar with sign language,
who have knowledge of how to treat a disabled
individual. Employees should be informed more
about providing services to disabled people (Atak,
2008: 71). If necessary, the Ministry of Tourism
should prepare hotel programs and trainings about
how to treat disabled people by educating their staff
about this issue (Burak, 2018: 148).
t Instead of assimilating disabled people in
accommodation establishments should be
integrated with other people.
Hospitality managers should not exclude people
with disabilities from other healthy people; Using the
same pool, restaurant and beach with other people
with disabilities will make them both psychologically
and physiologically satisfied. Studies have shown
that people with disabilities do not want to take a
holiday together with people with disabilities like
themselves and that they want to spend time with
healthy individuals (Yenişehirlioğlu, 2013: 78).

In addition, arrangements for disabled people in
accommodation establishments should be designed
not only for a specific type of disability, but to cover
all disability groups (types) (Burak, 2018: 148).
t "DDPNNPEBUŔPO FTUBCMŔTINFOUT TIPVME
provide accurate and adequate information
to people with disabilities taking into account
their disability.
Accommodation establishments must provide
timely information to enable people with disabilities
to act safely, comfortably and freely within the
accomodaation enterprise, taking into account the
types of disability. The use of elevators should be
informed according to the disability types (hearing,
vision and physical disability). In this context,
accommodation facilities, elevators, stairs, pools,
beaches and roads should be designed to suit all types
of barriers at a universal level, affective surfaces,
audible warnings and wheelchair users should
have a large interior space. There should be clear,
comprehensible, general warning, signs showing the
characteristics of general and accessible areas within
the accommodation establishment, they should be
sensitive about providing quality services for the
disabled, and should provide accurate and complete
information about the services they offer (Burak,
2018: 147). At the same time, hotel managers should
be made aware of accessible tourism by the Ministry
of Tourism (Atak, 2008: 71).
As a result, in the tourism sector, where there
is intense global competition in line with the winwin policy, the managers of public sector and the
managers of accommodation enterprises should
have the necessary knowledge, awareness and
awareness about accessible tourism in the context of
sustainable tourism.
Further studies can be extended to databases,
topics and / or year breaks. In this way, this study
which is prepared in systematic review method can
be enriched. This study focuses on the perspectives
of accessible tourism accommodation businesses
in Turkey. In the future studies, the activities of
accommodation companies operating in other
countries on accessible tourism and their managers’
perspectives on accessible tourism can be evaluated.
Thus, in Turkey and accommodation businesses in
foreign countries it can be analyzed in comparison
to the systematic review methods.

Article

It has been determined that the number of disabled rooms in the construction process
of accommodation enterprises is taken into consideration in the legal regulations
in the country and that there is no need to create more disabled rooms. It has been
determined that there are deficiencies and inadequacies in the arrangements made for
disabled guests within the accommodation business and some applications are made
in accordance with the legal requirements. It was found that having a wheelchair in
the facility and placing a disabled toilet stone in the bathroom was seen as a room
designed for disabled people.

Büyükşalvarcı,
Article
Şapçılar and Tuncel

According to the findings of the study, it was determined that touristic accommodation
enterprises operating in Konya Province do not give sufficient importance to accessible
tourism. It is observed that they behave more sensitively in areas such as rooms,
corridors, general usage areas and bathrooms for people with physical disabilities,
but visual signs for hearing impaired people and sound systems for visually impaired
people are not sufficient. It has been determined that accommodation companies
attach more importance to situations that require legal obligation, but they show less
tendency and sensitivity to other areas.

Yaylı and Öztürk

Article

It can be said that the viewpoints of accommodation enterprises managers towards
accessible tourism and market are positive. In addition, it can be stated that as the
number of stars given to the enterprises in line with the services owned and offered
by the ministry increases the viewpoints of the accessible tourism market positively
increases.

Article

According to the data obtained, it was determined that physical and structural
arrangements for disabled people in accommodation enterprises were made in order
to meet legal requirements and however, the existing regulations were only for the
physically disabled and the requirements of the visually and hearing impaired were
not taken into consideration. In this context, it has been tried to develop solutions for
the sector.

Yenişehirlioğlu and
Article
Türkay

As a result of the research findings, it has been determined that accommodation
enterprises partially conform to the needs of disabled people in terms of design and
architecture, but this suitability is not in a position and level where disabled people
can move freely. As a result of the findings obtained from people with disabilities, it has
been determined that accommodation workers or tourists do not have any negative
perception of people with disabilities.

Bulgan and Çarıkçı

Article

It has been determined that the managers of accommodation enterprises consider
themselves sufficient and competent in terms of service quality in terms of structural
and hardware and service personnel in terms of providing service to accessible tourism
market. Another important finding from this study have been identified that disabled
guests come mostly in the less warm spring and autumn months.

Thesis

As a result of the study, it was determined that the managers of accommodation
enterprises were not aware of the importance of accessible (disabled) tourism market.
In addition, it is revealed that touristic accommodation enterprises generally comply
with the legal regulations which are obliged to fulfill for disabled people, but the
related legislation is insufficient in comparison with developed countries in the context
of universal design.

Thesis

The findings show that there are some physical deficiencies and arrangements that
need to be fulfilled within the scope of accessibility. In addition, it has been concluded
that the opinions of the accommodation enterprises managers about accessible
(disabled) tourism are positive but it is not yet suitable for accessible (disabled) tourism
of İzmir province.

Atak

Thesis

It was found that the managers of the accommodation enterprises were not very
knowledgeable about the relevant market and that they were quite new and
unprepared for this target market formed by people with disabilities and however,
they were very willing to move towards the accessible tourism market.

Uslu

Thesis

According to the results of the study, it is concluded that the managers of
accommodation enterprises in Alanya destination are not aware of the importance
of the market for physically disabled tourism and they have similar opinions about
accessible tourism, however they want to get enough share from accessible tourism.

ABSTRACT

T

he increase in tourism facilities and recreation areas has led people to seek different places.
Especially in today’s world, people want to spend their spare time as colorful and high quality
as possible in their remaining time from the time they meet their work and vital needs, and to
use their limited spare time in the best and unforgettable way. This is where the theme parks come into
play. The theme parks are filled with different themes, cartoons and comic book heroes, science and
technology elements, science fiction and fairy tales.
Theme parks do not only benefit people. They also cause serious changes in the location where they are
established. Themed parks stimulate the economy in their area and provide local people with financial
benefits. In this way, the local people who earn money, the theme park is protected and protected. One
of the elements that experience the economic impact of the theme park is the city hotels. Particularly
during certain periods (holidays, semester breaks), the theme parks can reach almost 100% occupancy
rate as a result of the influx of visitors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the
theme parks operated by the private sector operating in the city of Antalya. Situation analysis, which is
one of the qualitative research methods, was used as the research method. A semi-structured interview
with theme park managers was conducted. According to results, the managers stated that the theme
parks had a positive effect on the development of tourism in Antalya and the spread of tourism to 12
months. Also theme parks are thought to have made a great contribution to tourism. For example, the
extension of the tourism season, the hotel occupancy rates, guests’ stay time, room prices and visitor
profiles can be given as an example to affect positively

INTRODUCTION
People enjoy the variety of things they like, such as movies, serials, music, legends, historical elements. This
is also an important element that brings society together and causes it to socialize. For example, it would
be a great pleasure if a well-liked film’s hero welcomes or accompanies people during their holidays, thus
greatly increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. In this context, theme parks and hotels have emerged,
aimed to make people feel unfamiliar by bringing together elements that people already know and love,
quickly adapting to the maximum enjoyment of their vacation and have enable customers to choose again.
In this sense theme parks have been beneficial to the surrounding city hotels.
Visitors who come to spend
01
time in theme parks have preferred the city hotels for accommodation. In fact, theme parks have affected
many factors such as the length of the season they come, room prices, length of stay, occupancy rates, visitor
profile and services provided.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Theme Parks
In recent years, theme parks and attractions
have become the most popular types of mass
entertainment venues. Theme parks have become
a relatively new entertainment concept that try
to create the fantasy atmosphere of another place
or time, while the recreational parks are gaining
poularity at the turn of the century. Theme parks
are generally designed to address the family as a
visiting unit and are considered a leisure activity, as
they provide an opportunity for entertainment in
an individual’s free time (Milman, 2001, s. 139). At
the same time, the atmosphere and activity in the
theme park contribute to the enjoyment of active
participation by visitors in general. Visitors usually
spend a day in the theme park (Bigne, Andreu, &
Gnoth, 2005, s. 837). Theme parks, which are of
great importance in the tourism sector, contribute
greatly to the promotion activities and economic
development of the countries and also support the
tourism sector seriously. Theme parks, which create
huge attraction centers in order to reveal the wishes
and dreams of the people, are able to attract the
attention of their visitors thanks to the innovations
within them (Küçük & İnce, 2018, s. 19).
When the studies on theme parks were examined,
Deniz (2002) examined the design principles of
themed parks and gardens in his master thesis.
Topaloğlu (2007) studied Ankara wonderland city
park within the scope of the theme park concept.
Gök and Bingöl (2017) examined the history of
theme parks and the history and culture themed
parks in their article titled “History and Cultural
Themed Parks”. In her article Yıldız Altın (2017)
wrote about the use of folklore in theme parks in her
article on the unification of culture in the context
of entertainment industry. In her master thesis,
Yücesoy (2017) conducted a research to determine
the theme parks and suitable themes for Bursa. In
his book chapter, Özcan (2017) made an evaluation
on the economic analysis of theme parks and the
possible effects of Ankapark. In their articles, Aylan
and Şalvarcı (2018) examined the importance of
recreation areas in terms of urban tourism within
the framework of Konya-themed parks. Küçük and
İnce (2018) examined the concept of thematic park
in Kayseri Anatolian Wonderland case. In his article,
Tuna (2018) made an examination under the title of
themed parks and child friendly tourism. Eyüpoğlu
(2018) has written a master thesis on Theme park
as a socio-cultural and architectural program: A
critical review of Ankapark, Ankara. In his master’s

26

thesis, Gülhan (2019) evaluated the economic effects
of theme parks in terms of tourism within the scope
of Sazova Park.
A theme park can be defined as an entertainment
product that combines tangible goods and intangible
services. ‘Theme park product’ consists of three
product layers (Birenboim, Anton-Clave, Russo, &
Shoval, 2013, s. 605).
t #BTŔDQSPEVDUit is what the customer buys
primarily: the excitement and / or atmosphere
created by the visitors.
t .BUFSŔBM QSPEVDU the creative capacities
of designers and planners are transferred
to the content of the park (safety, driving,
attractions and shows, brand name, quality of
services, sharing the park with other people).
t *ODSFBTFE QSPEVDU catering and retail,
parking, services for visitors with special
needs, complaints handling procedures,
opening hours and weather.
The oldest theme parks in the United States
came into activity in the last half of the 19th century.
The first American amusement park was the World
Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893.
In 1897, Steeplechase Park, the first of three major
parks, was opened on Coney Island in Brooklyn,
New York. Introduced as a safe, clean, aesthetically
appealing, creative entertainment facility in
California in the mid-1950s, Disneyland has a
unique design for both children and adults. Theme
parks, especially regional parks, were endemic in
the US in the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, in the
1980s and 1990s, most parks have been developed
as destination parks (Heo & Lee, 2009, s. 447). The
tourism industry is an important pillar of the world
economy and in some economies theme parks make
a major contribution. The US amusement park
provides jobs for approximately 500,000 seasonal
employees and generated $ 12 billion in 2007 (Dong
& Man Siu, 2013, s. 541).
Theme Parks can be categorized as theme parks
with adventure and entertainment theme, science
fiction theme, nature theme and history theme
according to the usage patterns of consumers. In
terms of their size, these parks are scaled according
to the number of visitors annually and classified as
follows (Özcan, 2017).
t -BSHFćFNF1BSLT Theme parks with more
than 1 million visitors.
t .ŔEEMF ćFNF 1BSLT Theme parks that
reach between 250 thousand and 1 million
visitors.
t 4NBMMćFNF1BSLT Theme parks with 250
thousand or less visits.

t -BSHF"NVTFNFOU1BSLT Parks with more than 500,000 visits and an instant payment system.
t 4NBMM "NVTFNFOU 1BSLT Amusement parks with an instant payment system with fewer than
500,000 visits.
Recently, modern theme parks and other theme accommodation facilities have adopted pre-existing
elements as a key element in the development of the theme concept. These include folklore, mythology,
legends, movies, places to see or popular TV shows. It is important to note that audiences are familiar with
the story, but it is not so important to the guest’s experience. Contemporary theme parks are the idea that
the focus of creating new value for popular customers of the twentieth century shifts from commodity
consumption to services and ultimately to experience. While today’s theme parks compete for providing
entertainment products that are appropriate to the atmosphere and service, they have changed the meaning
of mechanical driving or attractions to a post-modern interactive experience with storytelling involving
five senses. In this modern theme park environment, employees have become actors in which their
responsibilities to create a thematic environment are extended beyond their operational operational tasks
(Milman, 2010, s. 231).
The impact of theme park operations brings both benefits and challenges to the local community
and cultural order. A theme park in an area provides contact between residents and visitors. This may
be problematic in areas where the inhabitants’ traditional cultural order is quite different from that of
park visitors. Also, when there is a significant socioeconomic difference between visitors and residents
of the area, this can cause a problem. For example, problems may include misunderstandings and
disagreements between residents and visitors due to the overcrowding of facilities and transportation, overcommercialization of trade, differences between languages, traditions and value systems, and violation of
local dress code. Theme parks have a particularly high participation rate and therefore the density of visitors
in space and time is a major problem. On the other hand tourism in an area can improve people’s living
standards and help to pay for improvements in community facilities and services if the economic benefits
of tourism are well-distributed (Raluca & Gina, 2008, p. 637). In Table 1 below includes the 25 most visited
Theme Parks, their number of visits in 2017-2018 and the percentage of change between them (Themed
Entertainment Association, 2019).

City Hotels and Features
City hotels are the structures around the commercial centers. They have been created as complex facilities
to meet the needs of cultural changes, sports activities, bed and eating and drinking. The rapid increase
in tourist demand led to the revival of the hotel market and increased the diversity. As a result, there is a
change from small hotels to modern urban hotels. This development in the hospitality sector has been at
the forefront not only with individual and innovative hotel owners, but also with international hotel chains
and their hotel designs (Fischer, 2008, p. 7).
City hotels are located in the city center and are mostly short-term or long-term businesses for
businessmen to do their jobs. These hotels host business meetings, conferences, meetings and entertainment
activities. Especially in European countries, accommodation and breakfast service is offered in this type
of establishments. City hotels are built by converting private homes into accommodation and are usually
built in populated centers or in places where tourists often prefer. Such facilities have been accepted and
developed in terms of preventing the economic difficulties in traditional hotel management workforce and
hotel restaurant applications (Aktaş, 2002, p. 24-29).
When determining the location where the city hotels will be built, the functioning of the city, the
function that the region will load on the hotel and the architectural structure of the region are taken into
consideration. The location of the hotel is located in a city center or cottage where construction is intense,
and directly affects the general location of the hotel and its connection with the environment (Yakartepe,
2011, p. 83). For example, the choice of location of a city hotel built for business purposes, transportation
vehicles, proximity to terminals, close to working areas and entertainment centers, having an appropriate
architectural understanding with the environment is a reason for choice for business travelers (Yolcu,
2006). In addition, city hotels are improving the surrounding structures due to their structural function.
The shopping centers, parks, restaurants, exhibition areas and commercial centers in the vicinity of the
hotel develop according to the requirements of the urban environment in connection with the functions of
the hotels (Mcneill, 2008, p. 384).

When the impact of theme parks on city hotels is examined, studies reveal that theme parks affect the
occupancy rate of hotels. It is seen that the occupancy rates of the hotels located closer to the theme park
are higher than those of the faraway hotels. For example, as shown in figure 1, Resort World Sentosa Hotels
achieve higher occupancy rates than Singapore Luxury Hotels. Theme parks also allow guests to stay around
the theme park, significantly extending their stay and increasing the tendency to revisit that destination.
While being close to theme parks generally increases hotel occupancy, the distance to the city center should
not be neglected. The fact that the hotels are close to the city center means that they are easily accessible. As
seen in Disneyland Hong Kong and Sentosa Singapore, the proximity of the theme parks to the city center
or the easy access to the city center leads to a high level of attendance for daily visitors (Sona & Lund, 2014).

METHOD
Particularly in recent years, participation in tourism in line with the wishes of tourists has become focused
on experience by leaving only sea, sand and sun coverage. Tourists prefer different experiences that add
excitement to themselves, improve their personal skills and allow them to experience the excitement they
have never experienced before. It offers experience to tourists with activities in themed parks. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the theme parks operated by the private sector operating
in the city of Antalya. Within the scope of this aim, Themed Parks, which have become prominent in the
popularity of attracting tourists in Antalya in recent years, have been selected and a research universe has
been formed. The analysis units that make up the research universe; The Lands Of Legends Theme Park, a
subsidiary of Rixos Hotel Group, Dinazor Park, a Tetra Group subsidiary, and Park Funtastic, a subsidiary
of Dayıoğlu Transportation. The analysis units that make up the research universe; The Lands Of Legends
Theme Park, a subsidiary of Rixos Hotel Group, Dinazor Park, a subsidiary of Tetra Group, and Dayıoğlu
Transportation Tur Ltd. Şti. Sti. is owned by Park Funtastic.
Situation analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods, was used as the research method.
The case study, which is considered as a research method, has different names in the literature such as case
study or case study. Qualitative research is an approach that focuses on understanding social phenomena in
a realistic and holistic way within their environment (Yıldırım & Şimşek, 2011: 39). In this context, he argues
that social phenomena can be understood by separating the unique dimensions
01of a situation based on the
relativity of the social world. The reasons for preferring the case study method in the research include the
fact that the research subject wants to be examined in its own environment, to provide in-depth information
about the subject, the research center to have its own characteristics and not to conduct studies on this subject
before. In addition, this method is preferred because it allows the development of new theories by allowing
to gather detailed information about a subject, event, business or region (Kılıç & Kurnaz, 2010: 46). As data
collection tools in this method, Yin (1984) mentions 6 sources in the data collection process: 1) documents,
2) archive records, 3) interviews, 4) direct observation, 5) participatory observation, 6) physical structures
29

4th International Tourism Congress

(technological instruments, artworks and other
physical evidence that can be used in the study). These
six sources of data collection can also be expanded
with films, photographs, video recordings, life stories
and nonverbal communication (Subaşı & Okumuş,
2017: 423).
In the scope of the situation analysis chosen in
the study, documents belonging to the analysis units
constituting the research universe were examined.
For this purpose, brochures, magazines, television
broadcasts, catalogs, web pages, etc. of the themed
parks are published. printed and virtual data
scanned. In the light of the information obtained
from document analysis and observation, a semistructured questionnaire was prepared for the
interview. In the form of questions, Cem TUNA,
General Manager of The Land of Legends Theme
Park, Mr. Soner İNAL, Park Funtastic Manager, and
Dinopark Public Relations Unit were interviewed.
All the information obtained was reported.
The questions in the structured form are as
follows;
1. Where did the idea of establishing a Theme
Park come from?
2. What are the services your Theme Park
offers?
3. What are the activities that Tema Park guests
can attend?
4. What activities can guests find in your
business in which months of the year?
5. What is the guest profile visiting the business?
6. How does the construction of your Theme
Park affect the occupancy rates and prices
of surrounding hotels during summer and
winter seasons?
7. What are the visitors of your Theme Park?

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
The findings obtained within the scope of the
research method have been explained by considering
the potential of attracting tourists to themed parks.

Findings of The Land of Legends
Theme Park
The Land of Legends Theme Park is located in
Serik district of Antalya. It is a theme park with
more than 20 adrenaline-filled units where guests
can experience uninterrupted adrenaline, touch
the sky with the 61-meter-high Hyper Coaster and
experience an adventure where they can meet water
after climbing to 43 meters with Typhoon Coaster.

30

In the thought of establishing a Theme Park,
Antalya was firstly favorable in terms of weather
conditions, the idea of spreading tourism to 12
months and the investment costs were appropriate.
The most important priority of the Theme Park
is to ensure the complete safety and security
requirements. The Land of Legends Theme Park,
which aims to ensure that families spend quality and
comfortable time with their children, sells memories
to families. Tema Park has a surfing course, balloon
up to 150 meters, adventure park, various character
shows and dolphin shows.
When the guest profile of the park is examined,
it is seen that 70% Russian, 20% European and 10%
Turkish guests constitute the visitor profile. Before
the construction of Tema Park, the tourism season,
which was 4 months, increased to 10 months with
its construction. However, the fact that Tema Park
was free of charge allowed the price to be reflected
in the room and significantly affected the income of
the hotel.
In 2017, 600,000 people visited the Theme Park,
which increased to 700,000 in 2018. The target is to
reach 900,000 people in 2019.

Findings of Park Funtastic
Located in the Kepez district of Antalya, Park
Funtastic is a thematic park full of sporting activities
and entertainment for all ages and tastes.
Park Funtastic, the largest mountain sled in
the Mediterranean region, also organizes various
concerts. Park Funtastic’s peak season is spring and
autumn, which includes activities such as sledding,
ATV, Zipline, Amusement Park, Survivor, Paintball,
Thematic Park, Go Kart, Pool Boat, Horse Track,
Scoop Park and Bicycle Park.
60% of the visitor profile is composed of local
adult visitors, 30% is student visitors and 10% is
foreign visitors. The location of the park close to
Konyaalti district, famous for its beach, has enabled
tourists coming to this region to visit the park. The
theme park has had a positive impact on the city
hotels in the region. Although it has been 6 months
since the completion of the opening and renovation of
the park, approximately 200,000 people have visited.

Findings of Dinopark
Located in the Kemer district of Antalya, Dinopark
is home to models that have been produced in
exact dimensions in accordance with the fact of the
extinction of extinct dinosaurs millions of years ago.
These animated models can make the dinosaurs’
natural sounds and give the feeling that they are

alive with their looks and breaths. Dinosaurs known
from films and documentaries can be visited within
walking distance. The park, which has a Dinopark
Excursion Track, includes various activities such
as Planetarium, 7D Cinema, Fossil Pool, Climbing
Wall, Dino-Vivor, Bumper Boats, Pool Games,
Children’s Workshop, Mini Zoo, Trampoline and
Pony.
Dinopark provides benefit for tourists staying
in Göynük region to go out of the hotel and spend.
In 2018, Dinopark visited 210,000 local and foreign
visitors.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
While tourism continues to spread throughout the
world, the trend of sea-sand-sun trio is gradually
losing. People have begun to demand not only to
rest in their holidays but also to have fun by acting
within certain themes. As a result of all these, people
participating in tourism activities, sports, adventure,
competition, adrenaline-filled activities, such as
entertainment can be carried out on the move to
search for alternative tourism products. As a result of
all these, Theme Parks were established and started
to be developed to meet these needs.Theme Parks
have attracted certain audiences thanks to their
various themes and continued to carry out their
activities by increasing the number of visitors. With
the various themes they have, they have managed
to make people feel themselves sometimes in a film
or a story. Theme parks, which are increasing their
popularity all over the world, have become important
contributors to the development of tourism. The
increase in the number of people visiting Theme
Parks every year supports this idea. The managers of
the theme parks examined within the scope of the
research stated that the theme parks had a positive
effect on the development of tourism in Antalya
and the spread of tourism to 12 months. New hotels
have started to be built around The Lands of Legens
which has become an important theme park not
only in Antalya province but also in our country
especially in terms of guest visits. In addition,
activities such as the sale of souvenirs or local dishes
in theme parks such as Park Funtastic and Dinopark
provide economic benefits to local people in terms
of tourism revenues. Braun (2001, s. 81) stressed
the importance of theme parks in terms of tourism
in his book on Economic Impacts of Theme Parks
on the Regions and stated that Disneyland branded
hotels are the most preferred hotels in the Anaheim
region. At the same time, the activities taking
place in these parks increase the satisfaction level

of tourists by having different experiences. In this
way, Antalya becomes a tourism city which has the
characteristics of being a destination that attracts
tourists only within the sea, sand and sun triangle.
In addition, the increase of themed parks will lead
to the formation of healthy generations who care
about recreational activities.
In short, as a result of the research, Theme Parks
are thought to have made a great contribution to
tourism. For example, the extension of the tourism
season, the hotel occupancy rates, guests’ stay
time, room prices and visitor profiles can be given
as an example to affect positively. Theme Parks in
our country to reach the number of visitors close
to the examples in the world; will make a major
contribution to tourism and will positively affect the
development of our tourism destinations.

ABSTRACT

T

he image which is defined as the sum of beliefs, ideas, and impressions that a person has a
destination, is also a valuable concept in the tourism development of cities. Factors affecting
city image consists of functional characteristics, concerning the more tangible aspects of the
city, such as infrastructure, environment, commercial activities, touristic services, recreation facilities,
cultural activities and psychological characteristics, concerning the more intangible aspects, such as
quality of life, hospitality of local resident and atmosphere of the city. In addition, another important
element in the formation of the city image is unique attractions that belong to the city and integrate as
the symbol of the city. This study focuses on the role of unique attractions in the formation of the city
image. In this research, Sazova Science Culture and Art Park, which is one of the unique attractions
of Eskişehir, was chosen as the case through the typical case sampling method by using the case study
design. The aim of the research is to determine the image of the Sazova Science Culture and Art Park in
the views of the visitors and to evaluate the contribution of this attraction to the city image of Eskişehir.
For this purpose, TripAdvisor was selected for data collection and 265 comments between 01.08.201831.07.2019 were analyzed by content analysis technique. The findings show that Sazova Science Culture
and Art Park has a strong positive image and this attractiveness also has a feature that shapes Eskişehir
city image.
Keywords: City Image, Unique Attractions, Eskişehir, Sazova Science Culture and Art Park

INTRODUCTION
The success of cities in city tourism requires a strong image. Due to the complex nature of cities and the
combination of many services, the formation of a strong image is not easy. The presence of strong image
positions cities in a different place in the eyes of visitors and plays an important role in increasing the
number of tourists in cities.
The dimensions that determine the image of a destination in the context of city tourism are: natural
resources; general infrastructure; touristic infrastructure; tourist leisure and recreation; culture, history
and art; political and economic factors; natural environment; social environment; atmosphere of the place
(Beerli and Martin, 2004: 659). Some of these dimensions contain functional or more tangible characteristics
of destination, while others are psychological or more abstract characteristics. Some images of destinations
could be based upon observable or measurable characteristics such as scenery, attractions, accommodation
facilities, price levels while others could be based on more intangible characteristics like friendliness, safety,
atmosphere (Echtner and Richie, 2003).
Echtner and Richie (2003) asserted that there is one additional dimension of the destination image.
According to Echtner and Ritchie, images of destinations can range from those based common functional
01 or auras. From this point
and psychological traits to those based on more unique features, events, feelings
of view, the role of unique attractions in the formation of city image was investigated in this study. Sazova
Science Culture and Art Park, one of the unique attractions in Eskişehir, which has rapidly increased in city
tourism in recent years was selected as a research area in the study and the image of the park was tried to be
determined in the light of the online comments shared by visitors.

Sazova Science Culture and Art Park is the largest
park in Eskişehir with an area of approximately 400
thousand square meters. The park consists of several
parts. These parts are; Dream Castle which is a first

sports, playgroups consisting of heroes, children’s
various activities they can do playground for water,
playground for children with disabilities. Private
sightseeing trains are available within the parking
area (Eskişehir Provincial Directorate of Culture and
Tourism, 2019).
Within the scope of the study, first of all, a
literature review on the concept of image öncelikle
was presented and then the results of the research
which analyzed the comments between 01.08.2018
and 31.07.2019 about Sazova Science Culture and
Art Park on TripAdvisor were explained and various
suggestions were offered.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Following the early works of Boulding (1956)
and Martineau (1958) who proposed that human
behaviour is dependent upon image rather than
objective reality, academic interest in several fields
and discipline regarding the concept of image has
been increased. The image concept has generally been
considered as an attitudinal construct consisting of
an individual’s mental representation of knowledge
(beliefs), feelings, and global impression about an
object or destination (Baloğlu and McCleary, 1999:
870). However, Dichter (1985: 75) viewed image as
total impression which is formed as a result of the
individual attributes. According to Dichter, image
describes not individual traits or qualities, but the
total impression an entity makes on the minds
of others. It is the most powerful influence in the
way people perceive things and should be a crucial
concept in shaping marketing, advertising, and
communication efforts.
The image of a destination consists of the
subjective interpretation of reality made by the
tourist (Bigné et al., 2001). Hunt (1975:1) described
the destination image as “the perceptions held
by potential visitors about an area”. According to

34

Crompton (1979: 18), destination image is “the sum
of beliefs, ideas, and impressions that a person has a
destination”. In the context of destination marketing,
image is a valuable concept. What the potential
customers think about the natural attractions,
climate, people or cultural life of a destination may
shape images which detract from or contribute to
successful development. Although a destination may
have high quality of touristic attractions, a negative
image may detract from realizing potential use or
optimum touristic and economic development
(Hunt, 1975). Destination image influences a
tourist’s travel decision-making, cognition and
behaviour at a destination as well as satisfaction
and recollection of the experience (Jenkins, 1999).
In their study, Chen and Tsai (2007) revealed that
destination image not only influences the decisionmaking process but also conditions after-decisionmaking behaviours of tourists. Destination image
appears to have the most important effect on
behavioural intentions, in other words intention to
revisit and willingness to recommend.
The formation of the image has been described
by Reynolds (1965) as the development of a
mental construct based upon a few impressions
chosen from a flood of information. In the case of
destination image, this “flood of information” has
many sources including promotional literature
(travel brochures, posters), the opinions of others
(family/friends, travel agents), the general media
(newspapers, magazines, television, books, movies)
(Echtner and Ritchie, 2003), and today especially
internet and social media. Image is mainly caused
or formed by two major forces: personal factors
and stimulus factors. Personal factors are the sociodemographic characteristics, prior knowledge,
needs, values, motivations, preferences and
personality of the visitor. Personal factors, affect
one’s cognitive organization of perceptions, thus
also influencing the perceptions of the environment
and the resulting image. The formation of image
is closely related to sociodemographic variables.
Sociodemographic variables such as age, gender,
occupation, education level can cause differences
in image perception. Motivations are one of the
important determinants of the destination image as
the reasons for individuals to participate in tourism
activities vary. These motivations determine the
image of the destination before and after the visit,
and the image begins to shape through these
motivations either consciously or unconsciously
during the destination selection process. (Baloğlu
and McCleary, 1999; Beerli and Martin, 2004).
Stimulus factors consist of information sources,
previous experience and distribution (Baloğlu
and McCleary, 1999). Information sources refer

to the amount and diverse nature of information
sources to which individuals are exposed, including
destination information acquired as a result of
having visited the place (Beerli and Martin, 2004:
661). Fakeye and Crompton (1991) emphasized
the role of information sources in image formation
process in their model. Although individuals have
never visited a destination before and have not been
in the process of getting any information, they have
an image about that destination. Gunn (1988) called
this image as organic image. According to Gunn,
many images are the result of readers’ assimilation
of material from books, newspapers, etc. For
example, children’s geography or history books are
probably the most influential in the early formation
of images. The second level of tourist images, as
called induced images, derives from a conscious
effort to develop, promote, and advertise (Gunn,
1988). According to the model of Fakeye and
Crompton (1991), at first tourists develop organic
images for alternative destinations. With their
motivation to travel, they enter into the process
of active information search and develop induced
images for alternative destinations. The extent of this
search will vary from zero search, in which case the
organic images are likely to be decisive, to extensive
search, which may result in induced images that
are substantially different from the organic images.
Upon visiting the selected destinations, a tourist
will develop a more complex image resulting
from actual contact with the area. Complex
images constitute the final phase of the process
and incorporate experiences at the destination
(Fakeye and Crompton, 1991). Experience may
also influence the post-visit perceived image of
the destination. When there is past experience, the
criteria for decisions are strengthened, while the
need to receive information becomes weaker (Beerli
and Martin, 2004). Crompton (1979) revealed that
people form their image on the basis of what they
or their acquaintances have actually experienced at
the destination. It implies that a destination cannot
do very much to create an image of itself which is
different from what it really is.
The complex image developed by individuals
for a destination has both perceptual/cognitive
and affective evaluations. Perceptive/cognitive
evaluations referring to the individual’s own
knowledge and beliefs about the object, and affective
appraisals relating to an individual’s feelings
towards the object. Cognitive image is related to
destinations’ attributes, which can be functional/
tangible and psychological/abstract. Affective image
is related to the emotions that a tourist destination
is able to evoke and is developed depending on
the tourist’s psychological motivations. Finally,

perceptual/cognitive and affective image together
form the overall image of a destination (Baloglu and
McCleary, 1999; Beerli and Martin, 2004; Martin
and del Bosque, 2008; Stern and Krakover, 1993).
Echtner and Ritchie (2003: 46) asserted that
each of the destination image components contains
functional, or more tangible, and psychological,
or more abstract, characteristics. Furthermore,
images of destinations can also range from those
based on common functional and psychological
traits to those based on more distinctive or even
unique features, attractions, events or auras. To the
extent that Gartner and Hunt (1987:15) remarked
that images should be built around comparative
advantages. An area with unique natural resources
or recreation areas should undertake an assessment
of its comparative advantages and disadvantages
and market accordingly. However, concurrent with
assessing comparative advantages and disadvantages,
perceptions or images held by prospective travellers
should be ascertained.

METHODOLOGY
The aim of the study is to determine the image of
the Sazova Science, Culture and Art Park, one of
the unique attractions of Eskişehir, in the eyes of
the visitors and to evaluate the contribution of this
attraction to the image of Eskişehir. In the context
of this aim, the study basically sought answers to the
following 4 questions:

As can be seen from Table 5, the number of
negative comments about Sazova Science Culture
and Art Park experience of the visitors is far less
than the positive comments. The negative comments
of the visitors are divided into two as negative
comments about the overall park and negative
comments made on the basis of places or activities.
One of the most important negative statements
about the experience of the visitors regarding the
overall park is to charge for entrance to every place
in the park. 17 visitors (6.42%) stated that they were
not satisfied with this and indicated a negative park
experience. The fact that the park is overcrowded
especially on weekends, holidays and in summer
and queues at the entrance to the places is one of the
factors that negatively shape the visitors’ experiences.
9 visitors (3.40%) suggested that the park should not
be visited during the holidays due to the negative
experience of this situation. The fact that the trees
in the park have not yet grown enough to shade
is one of the factors that some visitors mentioned
negatively in their park experience. Because of this,
9 visitors (3.40%) stated that it is difficult to visit the
park in hot weather. 7 visitors (2.64%) remarked
that the food and beverage facilities within the
park are limited. These visitors asserted that they
had a negative park experience due to the crowded
food and beverage places and the lack of different
types of food and beverage. The fact that some of
the places in Sazova Science Culture and Art Park
do not serve on Mondays has a negative impact on
the experience of visitors who do not this issue. 6
visitors (2.26%) suggested to potential visitors
not to visit the park on Mondays by pointing this
situation. 4 visitors (1.51%) expressed that the park
is not a very special park in general and described
the park as an ordinary, artificial and a medium
quality park. Similarly, 4 visitors (1.51%) remarked
that the expectations should not be raised very high,
otherwise they might be disappointed while other 3
visitors (1.13%) stated that the park needs further
development. Other negative evaluations of the
overall park include that the park is far from the city
centre and difficult to Access (0.75%); not enjoyable
to visit in cold weather (0.75%); cycling is not allowed
in the park and there is constant pedestrian (0.75%);
insufficiency of orientation signs (0.38%); some
places require reservation (0.38%); long-distance
between places (0.38%); vehicle traffic at the exit
of the park (0.38%); insufficient toilets (0.38%); the
insufficient number of staff (0.38%) and the people
who did not obey the picnic rule (0.38%).
The Dream Castle is one of the negative
evaluations made on a spatial basis. In their
comments, 10 visitors (3.77%) remarked that the

Dream Castle looks beautiful from the outside
but it is disappointed in the interior. The visitors
mentioned this disappointment in their comments
and suggested that it is unnecessary to enter the
castle unless there is a child and participation
in the activities is not considered. According to
2 visitors (0.75%) the Pirate Ship; according to
other 2 visitors (0.75%) the Zoo and according to
1 visitor (0.38%) Science Experiment Center was
disappointing. Other spatial elements adversely
affected the experiences of visitors are the interior
of the Turkic World Science Culture and Art Center
is stuffy (0.38%); Sabancı Planetarium could not
be visited every time (0.38%); the sightseeing
train does not serve when the park is not crowded
(0.75%) and no information at the stops fort he
sightseeing train (0.38%).

Visitors’ Reviews of Eskişehir

CONCLUSION
In this study, which investigated the role of unique
attractions in the formation of the city image, it
was concluded that Sazova Science Culture and
Art Park has a strong positive image in the eyes of
visitors. Of the 265 reviews analyzed, the elements
such as the positive comments about the park are
much higher than the negative ones; the adjectives
were chosen by visitors to describe the park; the
fact that the park is an ideal area for children and
families; harboring natural attractions; away from
the stress of the city and including opportunities
for relaxation, rest and fun; offering many activities
together show that the park has become one of the
first places that come to mind about Eskişehir in
the views of the visitors.
In addition, it is understood from the results
of the study that the existence of many different
places with unique features including Dream Castle,
Pirate Ship, Science Experiment Center, Zoo, Eti
Underwater World, Japanese Garden and Sabancı
Planetarium enhances the overall image of the
park. Especially Dream Castle, Pirate Ship, Zoo, Eti
Underwater World are the places where the visitors’
comments are much more and these places form
the experiences of the visitors positively. Negative
evaluations of the overall park are far less in number
and are generally composed of fees, crowds and hot
weather.
As a city which has gained acceleration in city
tourism in recent years, the number of tourists has
been continuously increasing. Eskişehir has become
one of the most requested destinations for organized
tours. In the study of Evren and Kozak (2012), it
was concluded that the purposes of the visitors of
Eskişehir are to sightseeing-entertainment, and to

40

visit historical and cultural richness of the city. In
the same study, according to visitors Sazova Science
Culture and Art Park was one of the most attractive
factors of Eskişehir. In support of this result, this
study revealed that visitors identified the park as
the symbol of Eskişehir and has a strong image as a
unique attraction.
Another result of the current study is that the
positive image of Sazova Science Culture and Art
Park as a unique attraction also has an effect on the
formation of the city image of Eskişehir. In their
comments, the visitors made positive evaluations
for Yılmaz Büyükerşen who has been the Mayor
of Eskişehir Metropolitan Municipality since
1999. This situation is in parallel with the results
of Evren and Kozak (2012). They concluded that
the image of Yılmaz Büyükerşen is one of the most
important factors of Eskişehir which visitors put in
the forefront. In this study, visitors also mentioned
that Yılmaz Büyükerşen is a successful and visionary
Mayor. Besides, the positive comments of visitors
about Eskişehir also show that Sazova Science
Culture and Art Park reinforces the city image of
Eskişehir.
In order to make this advantage sustained by
Eskişehir with its unique attraction, the deficiencies
mentioned by the visitors about the park should be
eliminated. Efforts that will increase the awareness
of the park in national and international media
should be intensified. It is essential to have an active
website and social media pages which include all
the places and activities of the park together and
constantly updates on developments and events.
With the emphasis on marketing, promotion and
public relations related to the park, the sustainability
of this strong image provided by the park in terms of
city tourism will be ensured.

ABSTRACT

T

oday’s competitive business environment, complaint management should be considered as
an important issue in solving marketing problems and for customer satisfaction. Companies
must listen to their customers and give feedback. Customers must feel that their complains and
opinions are cared and problems are solved. Today’s Internet technologies make it easier for firms and
customers to interact with each other. The second generation of web based services is characterized
by having complaint management which allow people to share information and opinions (Miguens,
Baggio ve Costa, 2008). Online social travel networks are changing the way travellers plan their trips.
These websites allow tourists to provide reviews of visitors who stayed in hotels before. One of these
social networks is TripAdvisor which is well known around the world.
The aim of this study is to investigate online complaint management practices appeared in TripAdvisor.
One five stars, one four stars, two hotels were chosen as samples which operate in Canakkale city center.
For this purpose, the first fifty reviews about both hotels were examined which were written by Turkish
and foreign customers. Hotels’ answers were analyzed and evaluations were made regarding attitudes
and complaint management of the hotels. Totally hundred costumer reviews were analized. Qualitative
data analysis methods were used in the study. Customer comments were transferred to Excel program
and reviews were analyzed by content analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods. The
research is based on the first fifty reviews of the two hotels made in TripAdvisor between July 15 and
July 15 2019.
It is seen that there is no any response from both hotes to the reviews of Turkish guests. On the other
hand, some foreign guests’ reviews were responded. When the research findings were examined, it is
seen that both hotels do not pay necessary attention and they do not care about customer complaints. In
the study, it was concluded that customer complaints are generally related to the features of the rooms,
personnel behavior and service quality. It is concluded that the customer satisfaction is related to the
location of the hotel, the kitchen, the services offered (such as tennis court, spa) and staff characteristics.
Key Words: TripAdvisor, Complain Management, Çanakkale Hotels.

INTRODUCTION
Complaints management have been studied from a number of disciplinary perspectives. Complaints
management is about resolving individual complaints and identifying opportunities to make systemic
improvements. Every organisation that deals with the public or every business that market goods and
services will receive complaints. People expect companies and organisations to be customer-focused and
responsive to complaints. Companies and organisations are required to have complaints management
systems (CMS) in place and be accountable for their decisions and actions (Queensland Ombudsman,
2019). In certain circumstances, customers become almost inevitably unhappy due to various problems
or difficulties that are not always under the direct control of the company. Encouraging clients to express
their discontent is the first step recommended to managers in their effort to systematically learn about
customers’ negative experiences, restore satisfaction and strengthen business relationships (Fornell, 1992).

42

Complaints should be considered an indicator of
organizational performance assessment, signalling
some problems or failures in internal processes that
need quick recovery in order to avoid migration of
profitable customers. Furthermore, organizations
must learn that the consequences of loosing clients
are both profit decrease and negative word of mouth.
Consumers trust the comments shared on
tripadvisor (Taştan and Kızılcık, 2017). Users’ online
comments are a tool that provides communication
and information about tourism businesses for past
and future customers (Sparks and Bradley, 2014). The
aim of this study is to investigate online complaint
management practices for two hotels in Canakkale
throughout reviews published in TripAdvisor.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Complaint management is the process of
dissemination of information aimed at identifying
and correcting various causes of customer
dissatisfaction (Fornell & Westbrook, 1984). It
defines strategies used by companies to solve and
learn from the previous mistakes in order to restore
customer confidence in organizational reliability
(Hart et al., 1990).
TripAdvisor is the world’s largest travel platform
and helps 490 million travelers each month to
make their trips easier. Travelers across the globe
use the TripAdvisor site and app to browse more
than 760 million reviews and opinions of 8.3
million accommodations, restaurants, experiences,
airlines and cruises. Whether planning or on a
trip, travelers turn to TripAdvisor to compare low
prices on hotels, flights and cruises, book popular
tours and attractions, as well as reserve tables at
great restaurants. TripAdvisor, the ultimate travel
companion, is available in 49 markets and 28
languages (Tripadvisor, 2019). As an evidence of the
growing importance of online search and influence
on travel behaviors, a survey of the hotel and
restaurant industry in Europe in 2007 concluded
that 80% of UK consumers are researching online
before booking a hotel and half of them maintained
to have refrained from booking a specific hotel as a
consequence of a negative review on TripAdvisorlike websites (Pew Research Center, 2005).
In their study, Erdem and Yay (2017) found
that restaurant customers complained about staff,
then food and beverage, service, price, service
environment and menu, respectively.
According to Alrawadieh and Demirkol (2015),
the issues in which the customers make negative
comments in accommodation establishments are
determined as poor service quality, the low quality

of service, the quality and cleanliness of the facilities
(rooms, bathrooms etc.), personnel attitude and
performance, high prices, physical characteristics
of the enterprise environment, food and beverage
quality, not meeting the special requests of the
guests, misleading promotion and information.
Sparks and Browning (2010) found that the
negative reviews shared on TripAdvisor were
related to the internal (external features of the
rooms) and external (location of the hotel) factors
of hotel businesses. In the study of Sparks and
Bradley (2014), the typology of 150 negative
comments received from Tripadvisor was analyzed
and developed. The most criticized issues regarding
negative comments are room features and staff.
Then comes the ambiance and cleanliness.
In the study of Olcay and Sürme (2014),
customer complaints in a four-star hotel operating
in Gaziantep include general hotel services, food and
beverage services, room comfort and cleanliness,
respectively.
Gürkan and Polat (2014) examined 815
complaints made by domestic customers belonging
to 34 accommodation establishments operating in 14
different regions in the Aegean and Mediterranean
Regions. service quality, facilities, staff, pool-bound
and managerial. In particular, customers complained
of inadequate and poor quality of food & beverage
services, inadequate cleaning and hygiene, and
inadequate and defective materials used in rooms.
In this study Filip (2013) found that customer
complaining behaviour and subsequently on the
development and implementation of the service
recovery strategy.

METHOD
With the growing importance of social networking
and online complaint management, the aim of this
study is to investigate online complaint management
practices for two hotels in Canakkale throughout
reviews published in TripAdvisor,
For this purpose, the first 50 reviews of
Turkish and foreign customers of both hotels were
examined. Hotels’ answers to these reviews were
analyzed and evaluations were made regarding hotel
attitudes regarding complaint management. Total
100 costumer reviews were analized.
01
TripAdvisor evaluates customers’ opinions
based on five criteria: location, cleanliness, service,
room and sleep quality. In addition, there is a section
in the customer comments section where original
evaluations of customers can be made. In this study,
customer review of the hotel is analyzed according

43

4th International Tourism Congress

to these 4 criteria. Customer reviews are classified in two ways as satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The
customers were divided into two as Turkish and foreign and the reviews of Turkish and foreign customers
were compared.
Qualitative data analysis methods were used in the study. Customer reviews were transferred to Excel
program. Data were analyzed with Spss 22 analysis program. Customer comments were analyzed by content
analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods. The research is based on the first 50 reviews
made between July 15 and July 25, 2019.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
When the first hundred reviews of two of the top ten hotels operating in Çanakkale center were examined,
it was concluded that the accommodation was excellent between 40-50% in terms of room, service,
cleanliness, location and sleep quality, and between 8-16 % bad and lousy. It can be stated that they are
generally satisfied with the hotels located in the center of Çanakkale. Table 1.

Customer reviews were examined in the research are grouped under 4 categories. Categories based on
TripAdvisor customer reviews questions. These are:
1. Satisfaction from the rooms, the general cleanliness of the hotel, the care, the food and service, the
attention of the staff, the restaurant.
2. Dissatisfaction with the general cleanliness, maintenance, food and service, the attention of the staff
and the restaurant from the rooms.
3. Satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the general cleanliness of the hotel from the rooms, maintenance,
food and service, the attention of the staff, some of the restaurants
4. Other complaints and satisfaction.
When customer reviews are evaluated according to category 1:
It is seen that most of the customers (70%) express their satisfaction clearly. For example, the phrase
“hotel is very clean, staff is concerned and friendly”. Only eight of the satisfaction comments were returned
by guest relation department.
Costumer Reviews 1: “Goog everything.”
Hotel Reviews: “Dear Guest XXX, Thank you for choosing XXX Hotel for your stay in Çanakkale and
thank you taking the time to write a review on Tripadvisor.”
Costumer Reviews 2: “This it the location where you feel yourself at home with their great and friendly
staff. We are very glad to hear that you liked our customer service and XXX Hotel’s Location.”
Hotel Reviews: “Dear Mr XXX, Thank you so much for your short feedback and we are truly delighted
that you did enjoy your stay with us. We are very glad to hear that you liked our customer service and XXX
Hotel’s Location. Looking forward to welcoming you back in the future. Best Regards, Guest Relations
Department”
Costumer Reviews 3: “Amazing hotel with amazing facilities. Decoration is super/ wonderful kitchen.”
Hotel Reviews: “Thank you so much for taking the time to give us feedback. We are delighted to hear
that you had a great service from our team.”

Costumer Reviews 4: “I was surprised to see
such a large and modern hotel in Canakkale after
the ferry ride into the older part of town. There was
a supermarket across the street, a nice bar, a big
game room and an inviting pool looking out to the
Dardanelles.”
Hotel Reviews: “We really appreciate you
taking the time to give us feedback for your stay at
XXX Hotel.”
Costumer Reviews 5: “Modern with view of sea.
Got beautiful pix of sunset. Buffet dinner included:
Beef tips fish and vegetables were notable. Breakfast
buffet OK. Room with shower, pergo floors, modern
and clean. Thank you for choosing us for your stay
in Çanakkale and thank you very much for your
excellent comment about us. We are happy to hear
that you enjoyed your stay with us. We would love
to welcome you again in XXX Hotel in the future.”
Hotel Reviews: “Dear Our Guest XXX, Thank
you for choosing us for your stay in Çanakkale and
thank you very much for your excellent comment
about us. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed
your stay with us. We would love to welcome you
again in XXX Hotel in the future.”
Costumer Reviews 6: “Dardanelles, with a
beautiful view of the strait from our two room suite.
Dinner was very good. In addition, there is an indoor
lap pool (note swimmers need to have a bathing
cap), and the hotel offers spa services. There is nicely
maintained fitness center, outdoor soccer field, and
tennis courts. Wi-fi is available with strong signal.”
Hotel Reviews: “We would like to thank you
for your nice comments. We are all very happy to
hear that you had enjoyed your stay with us and do
appreciate your feedback.”
Costumer Reviews 7: “The food is also good and
the staffer friendly. This is a good hotel to stay.We
would like to thank you for your nice comments.”
Hotel Reviews: “We are all very happy to hear
that you had a wonderful stay with us and do
appreciate your feedback.”
Costumer Reviews 8: “This is a big hotel with
separate buildings and good view. The room is huge
and the suite is even nicer. Everything is clean and
all working.”
Hotel Reviews: “We would like to thank you
for your nice comments. We are all very happy to
hear that you had a wonderful stay with us and do
appreciate your feedback.”

When customer reviews are evaluated
according to category 2:
It is seen that very few (14%) of the customers
express their dissatisfaction clearly. For example,
“the room is dirty, cleanliness is very crappy, the
rooms are old, the staff are uninterested, the food
is bad”. Only three of the negative comments were
returned by guest relation department.
Spark and Brownin (2010), in their study,
shared negative comments via TripAdvisor, the hotel
operations of the interior (room features and customer
services) and external (hotel location) determined
that the factors are related. Similarly, Sparks and
Bradley (2014) found that negative comments were
mostly about room features and personnel behavior.
Costumer Reviews 1: “My wife and I agree
that the room was not clean” (Costumer 74). Hotel
Reviews: We really appreciate you taking the time
to give us feedback for your stay at x hotel. We do
appologize that your room experience was not up to
your expectation.
Costumer Reviews 2: “Stayed here for 2 nights
as it looked like the smartest hotel in the area.
Unfortunately, I would never stay here again in my
life. Two major issues; 1. Most of the staff were rude
and unhelpful (which was counter to all the other
hotels we stayed at in Turkey), 2. The rooms were
unbearably hot - a/c was not switched on and hot air
was pumped into the bathroom. Made sleeping very
difficult even with windows open. Definitely not what
you expect from a 5* hotel. Best avoided at all costs.”
Hotel Reviews: “We are very sorry to read that
overall your stay was not satisfying. As for the
We would like to inform you that our goal is total
customer satisfaction. XXX Hotel has several good
reviews and recommended by several guide books
customer service, it is very upsetting to read that it
was beneath your expectations.”
Costumer Reviews 3: “Room is very small and
dirty, staffs are rude.”
Hotel Reviews: “We are very sorry to read
that overall your stay was not satisfying. We do
appologize that your room experience was not up to
your expectation.”
When the customer reviews are evaluated
according to the category 3:
It is seen that 15 comments contain both
positive and negative evaluations.
Only two of these
01
comments were returned by the customer relations
department. For example:

45

4th International Tourism Congress

Costumer Review 1: “Stayed here for 2 nights
as it looked like the smartest hotel in the area. Nice
looking hotel, wonderful location (by the sea, just
out of town), great breakfast ... unfortunately I
would never stay here again in my life because room
is not claen. (Costumer 88).”
Hotel Reviews 1: “We really appreciate you taking
the time to give us feedback for your stay at XXX
Hotel. We do appologize that your room experience
was not up to your expectation. Once again we
would like to apologize for your disatisfaction and
would be happy to welcome you again in order to
prove XXX Hotel quality.”
Costumer Reviews 2: “Though not loud, they
were not silent. The hotel has a huge dining room
with a generous buffet. The quality was pretty good.
As you have experienced we have central heating
for winter and self controlled A/C for summer in
all rooms, the level of heat and wheather can be
adjusted from each room. We have checked the
adjust switches of the heating system in all rooms
whether it is working properly.”
Hotel Reviews 2: “Dear Guest XXX, Thank you
so much for taking the time to give us feedback. We
are delighted to hear that you had a great service
from our team. As you have experienced we have
central heating for winter and self controlled A/C
for summer in all rooms, the level of heat and
wheather can be adjusted from each room. We have
checked the adjust switches of the heating system in
all rooms whether it is working properly. We would
be happy to see you again in the XXX Hotel.”
When the customer evaluations are evaluated
according to the category 4:
It is seen that one (%1) comments contain both
positive and negative reviews.
Costumer Reviews 1: “The quality was pretty
good. But my wife is not relax in the room so room
is very hot.”
Hotel Reviews1: “Dear Guest XXX, Thank you
so much for taking the time to give us feedback. We
are delighted to hear that you had a great service
from our team. As you have experienced we have
central heating for winter and self controlled A/C
for summer in all rooms, the level of heat and
wheather can be adjusted from each room. We have
checked the adjust switches of the heating system in

46

all rooms whether it is working properly. We would
be happy to see you again in the XXX Hotel.”
When the returns of the hotel management are
examined regarding customer complaints, it is seen
that they generally thank the first ones in return,
then they are informed about the complaints made
or to be done, and there is an ongoing response
system with the wishes to see the customer again.
In the answers to customer satisfaction; write
the message of satisfaction and welcome again.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
Customer reviews do not consist solely of
complaints. Positive or negative assessments are
seen by potential customers. Customers consider
customer ratings before booking a stay. As well
as the extent to which the hospitality company
cares about customer reviews is understood by
looking at the response rate. Returning to customer
evaluations is important for customer satisfaction.
It is also considered as an attitude that will enable
future customers to think positively.
According to the results of the research; When
a total of 100 customer reviews are reviewed, it is
seen that 70 of them are pozitive, 14 of them are
completely negative and 16 of them are both positive
and negative.
It was found that only 14 out of 100 comments
were answered by the customer relations
department. Of the 14 comments, 8 were positive,
3 were negative, 2 negative and pozitive and 1 were
other subjects.
It is seen that there is no response to the reviews
of Turkish guests. Hotels answer reviews of foreign
customers. When the research findings were
examined, it is seen that both hotels do not pay
necessary attention to customer reviews and they do
not care about customer complaints. In the study,
it was concluded that customer complaints are
generally related to the features of rooms, personnel
behavior and service quality. The study concluded
that the customer satisfaction is related to the
location of the hotel, the kitchen, the services offered
(such as tennis court, spa) and staff characteristics.

ABSTRACT

T

he purpose of this study is to identify the needs of tourism faculty undergraduates to develop
their English communication skills with a comprehensive needs analysis and to investigate if the
stakeholders’ views about the students’ needs differ from one another. The study is considered
to be important because it included all the stakeholders of tourism faculties in Turkey to provide a
basis for a well-tailored vocational English curriculum and to increase the qualifications of tourism
faculty graduates. In this study, graduates and undergraduates of tourism faculties, tourism lecturers
and English language instructors at tourism faculties and executive representatives of the tourism sector
were taken as the stakeholders. The population of the study covered all tourism faculties in Turkey.
Sampling was taken from six different tourism faculties using the simple random sampling method
with a questionnaire. The sampling of the graduates and executive sector representatives was taken
from an Antalya-based association using the simple random sampling method again. Analysis of the
research data helped identify which stakeholders differed from one another in the needs of tourism
undergraduates for the development of tourism undergraduates’ English communication skills, and
relevant suggestions are offered to manage the differences and thus to increase the effectiveness of the
English courses currently given at tourism faculties.
Key Words: Needs Analysis, Tourism Faculties, English, Communication Skill

INTRODUCTION
The tourism sector is an industry that has increased its importance day by day and turned into a global
industry especially in the last quarter-century (Veijola, 2010: 84). In parallel with this, effective and
sustainable management of this rapidly growing industry gains importance and more qualified labour
force is needed in the sector (İçöz, 1991: 15; Jafari and Sola, 1996: 229; Kusluvan and Kusluvan, 2000:
251; Haven-Tang and Jones, 2008: 353). Tourism faculties are the institutions responsible for raising this
qualified laborforce in Turkey. The graduates of tourism faculties can’t reflect their tourism-related skills on
the sector without having sufficient English language skills due to the international nature of the tourism
sector (Kuppan, 2008; Hsu, 2010; Chen et al. 2011) because tourism is a sector where communication
among individuals from different countries is intense (Davras and Bulgan, 2012: 231).
In the literature, there are many studies conducted on the students learning English for special purposes
(Laborda, 2002; Blue and Harun, 2003; Lin et al. 2013; Lo, 2011). However, despite all the findings and
suggestions of these studies, tourism faculty graduates continue to fail to use their foreign language skills as
a means of communication following their graduation. In order to overcome such problems, it is necessary
to determine tourism undergraduates’ language needs and expectations from language teaching processes
correctly to be able to plan the objectives of vocational English courses and to create course contents in
line with their needs (Allwright and Allwright, 1977; Mackay and Mountford, 1978; Widdowson, 1981;
Hutchinson and Waters 1987; Waite, 1989).
Considering that English communication skills are very important for the tourism faculty graduates
and that the failure of the tourism faculty graduates in using English for communication purpose is
common, a detailed needs analysis needs to be conducted. Only in this way, it will be possible to design

48

English instruction effectively with the participation
of all the stakeholders of tourism faculties. It is also
important to find out whether there is a difference
between the views of the stakeholders who have
to jointly work to raise qualified graduates from
tourism faculties. This study aims to fill in this gap
in the relevant literature.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Since the services delivered in the tourism sector
are generally abstract, the quality of the personnel
employed in the sector increases the perceived
quality of the delivered services and reflects
positively on the customer satisfaction receiving
the delivered services (Kelley, 1992; MacVigar and
Rodger, 1996; Leslie and Richardson, 2000; Conlin
and Baum, 2003; Haven-Tang and Jones, 2008). The
opposite of this occurs when employees in the sector
lack adequate foreign language skills, and thus the
value of the tourist attractions offered to consumers
and their satisfaction levels decrease (Leslie and
Russell, 2006; Ghany and Latif, 2012; Akgöz and
Gürsoy, 2014). For these reasons, appropriate
English teaching and course design should be
implemented to make tourism graduates effective
foreign language users following their graduation
(Leslie and Russell, 2006).
In the present circumstances in Turkey, the
language practitioners and faculty directors’ views are
taken into account in the design of English courses
but the vocational needs of tourism undergraduates
for English communication skills are generally
ignored (İgrek, 2013). However, Hutchinson and
Waters (1991) emphasize the need to identify
undergraduates’ needs and to keep students at the
centre of language teaching and course design.

According to the reliability analysis of the pilot
study, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient was
found to be 0.89. This value indicates that the scale
is a highly (α> 0.70) reliable one (Hair et al., 2010).
The questionnaire was administered between July
and September 2018.

Population and Sampling
The research population consisted of all the
tourism faculties in Turkey. Therefore, the research
population consisted of tourism undergraduates,
tourism lecturers, graduates of tourism faculties,
English language instructors and executive
representatives of the sector. Due to the cost and
time-related limitations, the simple sampling
method was used in the sampling stage and sampling
was taken from 6 different tourism faculties. In order
to sample from tourism faculty graduates and sector
representatives, the questionnaire was administered
in an Antalya-based association whose members
consist of hotel managers, by using a simple sampling
method. The sample size of the participants was
calculated by using the sample size table suggested
by Cohen, Manion and Morrison (2000) and it was
aimed to administer the questionnaire on at least
384 participants.
A total of 448 questionnaires were administered
to tourism faculty undergraduates by the researcher
to six faculties. The questionnaire was replied by
90 tourism lecturers. A total of 32 questionnaires
were delivered to the English language instructors
at six tourism faculties and 22 questionnaires were
returned. 130 members from the chosen regional
association with around 1200 members filled out
the related questionnaire. 60 of them were found
to have a degree from a tourism faculty and the
remaining was found to be sector representatives.

METHOD
Quantitative data collection method was used in
the data collection stage in the study. The reason for
this is that it is more convenient to work with large
samples (Carr, 1994). The questionnaire developed
by Boran (1994) was used in the study. Three
different versions of the questionnaire were adapted
and no change was made in the content items except
the demographic questions and rhetoric language.
One version was adapted for the undergraduates,
one version was adapted for tourism lecturers and
English instructors at tourism faculties. The third
version was adapted for the representatives of the
sector and the graduates of tourism faculties. Each
version was piloted on a group of participants with
similar characteristics to the research population.

Purpose and Significance of the
Study
This study aims to determine whether there is
any difference between stakeholders’ views on
the English communication needs of tourism
undergraduates and to identify which stakeholders’
views differ from one another. Language learners,
who are the primary resources in needs analysis
may not be aware of 01
their English communication
needs. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the needs
analyst or course designers to determine the needs
of the students by ensuring the participation of all
stakeholders in the needs analysis. The findings of
such a needs analysis and designing courses in line

49

4th International Tourism Congress

with the findings will lead to positive consequences
for all stakeholders. To achieve success in practice, it
is important to identify the differences in the views
of all stakeholders regarding the needs of tourism
undergraduates. Only with this way, it will be possible
to design and successfully implement the courses
that fully meet the communication needs of tourism
undergraduates at maximum level, including
the setting of effective course objectives, course
materials, assessment tools and learning outcomes.
In the study, the following hypotheses have been
developed in order to determine the differences
between the views of the stakeholders regarding the
relevant needs of tourism undergraduates;
H1. Stakeholders’ views on the needs of tourism
faculty undergraduates to improve their English
reading skills significantly differ from one another.
H2. Stakeholders’ views on the needs of tourism
faculty undergraduates to improve their English
writing skills significantly differ from one another.
H3. Stakeholders’ views on the needs of tourism
faculty undergraduates to improve their English
speaking skills significantly differ from one another.
H4. Stakeholders’ views on the needs of tourism
faculty undergraduates to improve their English
listening skills significantly differ from one another.
H5. Stakeholders’ views regarding the
effectiveness of the English courses offered in tourism
faculties significantly differ from one another.
H6. Stakeholders’ views regarding the
participation of the stakeholders in the design of
English courses at tourism faculties significantly
differ from one another.
H7. Stakeholders’ attitudes towards English
significantly differ from one another.
This study is a significant one as it conducted a
comprehensive needs analysis based on all stakeholders’
participation to find out the needs of tourism
faculty undergraduates to improve their English
communication skills and also focused on the possible
difference between the views of the stakeholders
regarding the needs for developing tourism faculty
students’ English communication skills. It is not
possible to design appropriate course content, to adapt
appropriate teaching methods and techniques and to
achieve already set course objectives in the cases where
the language needs of the target students are ignored or
are not determined appropriately.

50

Data Analysis
The data obtained from the study was submitted for
relevant statistical analysis to determine whether there
is a statistical difference between the stakeholders’ views
regarding the needs of tourism faculty undergraduates
for the development of their English communication
skills and if there is, which stakeholders differ from one
another. For this purpose, percentages and frequencies
were calculated with SPSS. One-way ANOVA test
was used for between-group comparison because the
data for the related items were found to have a normal
distribution (between +2.0 and -2.0) (George, 2011).
When a significant difference was found, Gabriel Post
Hoc test was used to determine which groups differed.

FINDINGS
Demographic Findings Regarding
the Participants
As seen in Table 1, 41.9% (n = 259) of the participants
were female and 58.1% (n = 359) of them were
male. The number of participant students from the
tourism faculties was 62.5% (n=386). The percentage
of tourism lecturers was 14.6% (n=90). Then, the
sector representatives and graduates followed with
9.7% (n=60). The lowest participation rate was
found to be English instructors with 3.6% (n=22).

Findings Regarding the Evaluation of the English Courses at Tourism Faculties
One Way ANOVA test was conducted to see whether there is a significant difference between the
stakeholders’ views towards the evaluation of the English courses given at tourism faculties, and it was
found that there is a significant difference (p =, 001). Then, Gabriel Post Hoc test was conducted. As seen in
Table 7, the views of the English instructors differ significantly from the views of the undergraduates (p =,
022). Likewise, the views of the tourism lecturers differ significantly from the views of the undergraduates
(p =, 001). It was also found that the views of the undergraduates differ significantly from the views of the
graduates (p =, 001).

CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS
In light of the findings of the study, it could be concluded that tourism lecturers have the highest needs
expectations for English reading skills. However, it is also significant that their perceptions of the needs for
this skill are similar to those of English instructors at tourism faculties. At this point, it is seen that there is
a need for further studies examining the reasons why their perceptions are high.
The findings obtained from the between-groups analyses regarding English writing skills indicated that
the views of the tourism lecturers differed from those of the sector representatives, graduates and tourism
undergraduates. Again, as stated for English reading skills, the views of tourism lecturers were found to
have the highest perception of needs.
The findings obtained from the between-group comparisons conducted for English writing skills also
indicated that English instructors significantly differed from the tourism graduates. Graduates have lower
perceptions of need than the English instructors despite their sector experience. This finding can also be
attributed to the claims that knowledge of the English instructors regarding the sector is insufficient.
The findings obtained from between comparisons regarding needs for English speaking skills revealed
that tourism lecturers differed from the sector representatives, graduates and undergraduates. Tourism
lecturers have the highest perception of the need for English speaking skills among all stakeholders except
English instructors as in reading and writing skills.
According to the findings of between-group comparisons regarding English listening skills, tourism
lecturers differ from tourism undergraduates. However, they have a similar perception of needs for English
listening skills to the other stakeholders
The findings regarding the evaluation of the current English courses given at tourism faculties revealed
that tourism lecturers differed from tourism undergraduates. In other words, the perceptions of the tourism
lecturers regarding the achievements in gaining English listening skills in English courses are much higher
than the tourism undergraduates. Similarly, English instructors and tourism undergraduates differ in their
perception of achieving English listening skills at tourism faculties. Tourism undergraduates’ perception of
achieving English listening skills in English courses was found to be higher than English instructors. It is
noteworthy that undergraduates have higher perceptions of achievement in gaining English listening skills
than the English instructor.
Similarly, it is also noteworthy that the perceptions of tourism undergraduates about gaining English
listening skills in English courses differ from the graduates. This finding can be interpreted as follows. The
students who believe that they have gained adequate English listening skills in their undergraduate courses
understand that they have failed to acquire the relevant skills in their faculties when they attempt to use
their skills in the sector, but they do not have the chance to make up for their 01
loss. Therefore, the awareness
of undergraduates regarding their English language skills needs following their graduation is weak and
needs to be improved during their undergraduate education. It was also seen that all stakeholders should
be included in curriculum and course design, and all stakeholders have similar positive attitudes towards
English and the need for English teaching at tourism faculties.

55

4th International Tourism Congress

Another finding that can be concluded from these findings is that the tourism lecturers generally
differ from other stakeholders, and further studies are needed to improve their perceptions towards the
communication needs of their students. It could be said that their expectations are far from realistic.
Another point to be emphasized is the establishment of effective coordination between the English
instructors and the tourism lecturers and this will increase the effectiveness of the English courses (DudleyEvans and St John, 1998: 45). It could be claimed that the teaching hours at faculties are limited, and
implementing such a team-teaching approach will be time-consuming. In this case, one or two extra hours
per week could be created in faculties for such activities. An advantage of this kind of team teaching activities
is the creation of a positive perception of undergraduates that the tourism lecturers give importance to
English course and English teaching (Jordan, 1997; 121).
Besides, it will be possible to eliminate the possible missing information of the English instructors
regarding tourism and to correct any misunderstanding. This coordination can also be realized with the
other stakeholders so that all stakeholders can meet at a reasonable and realistic point in terms of the
needs of tourism undergraduates to improve their English communication skills as they are supposed to
collaborate in raising qualified graduates. As a result of this, the effectiveness of the English courses in
tourism faculties could be increased and the desired goals regarding undergraduates’ qualification could
be achieved. In the same way, it will be possible to bring the high perception levels of tourism lecturers
regarding the tourism undergraduates’ needs for improving their English communication skills to a normal
and realizable level.

ABSTRACT

T

he state of the Republic of Turkey has invested a large amount to educate qualified human resources
for into the tourism sector. What will make these investments meaningful is to increase their
qualifications. The role of academics is particularly important in increasing the qualifications of
students and education. In line with this, the aim of this research is to reach the views of the tourism
academicians who work in tourism faculties regarding the use of mobile augmented reality technology
(MAG) in tourism education. For this purpose, the research was carried out by qualitative method.
In the method part of the research, one-to-one interviews were conducted with 15 academics working in
the tourism faculties of Anadolu University and Eskişehir Osmangazi University using a semi-structured
interview form. The answers obtained were deciphered by the researcher and interpreted under four
themes: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats by applying content and frequency analysis.
Key Words: Tourism, Tourism Education, Multimedia, Augmented Reality

INTRODUCTION
The main source of any tourism-related organization, regardless of its national borders, is the de facto
employees of the organization. The quality of the staff reflects the quality of the organization. Finding the
right staff undoubtedly presents one of the biggest challenges to organizations (Leslie and Richardson, 2000:
489). According to Haven-Tang and Jones (2008: 353), tourism is a labor-intensive sector and customeremployee communication is an important determinant of quality. Running the right staff in the right place
at the right time, is critical to quality. According to Hawkins (1998: 82), as a result of the increasing use
of technology in the tourism sector, it is necessary and important to employ skilled, trained and qualified
personnel in the sector in the use of technological devices and software.
The integration of technology into education has become an important topic of study in the current era.
According to Pierson (2001: 427), technology integration in education is defined as facilitating the student’s
learning process by combining the teacher’s knowledge of technology with the pedagogical knowledge he
possessed. For Robinson (2008: 2130), the integration of technology into education is an integral part of a
comprehensive education reform. Technology integration covers many different topics. Technology alone
cannot help the student achieve learning goals, but it is a factor that offers great opportunities in facilitating
the path to learning goals.
Augmented reality (AR) is a technology in real time, based on real-world perception, where virtual
information is added as an extra layer. Augmented reality can technically be used to enhance all five senses,
but its most common use is visual. The added virtual layer is sometimes consist of sound, 3D objects, 3D
scenes or sometimes composed only of textual information (Loijens, 2017: 14). Azuma (1997: 356) defines
augmented reality as any system with the following three properties; To be able to combine reality and
virtual, to be able to work in real time and interactively, to be able to work in 3D. It is thought that the
mobile use of augmented reality technology, which has found a wide range of uses in different sectors and
achieved positive outcomes, has great potential in tourism education as well.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Tourism Education
Strengthening the understanding that human
resources are crucial to shaping the future of a
society leads to increased efforts to improve the
quality of education and training (Ural and Pelit,
2002: 219). Education is critical in developing
the country’s economy. Labor within factors of
production can only be strengthened by a welltrained human resource (Kızılırmak, 2000: 192).
The service industry in which tourism is involved
is distinguished from other industries by obvious
differences. For example, the product comes across
as an abstract concept in the service industry
unlike other industries. Such differences like these,
make the quality of human resources even more
important in service industries. The nature of the
products offered increases the importance of human
resources education (Lee-Ross and Pryce, 2010: 6).
When the local and foreign literature is
examined, when tourism education is mentioned the
main subject to be want to explained is vocational
education. Vocational education is a process that aims
to give people the knowledge, skills and abilities they
will use in their future professional lives (Hacıoğlu,
1992: 91). The main objective of vocational tourism
education is, to develop and train a student who
will can able to be a manager in the sector after the
graduate from the tourism program (Pauzé, 1993:
61). Tourism education focuses on the process that
aims to gain the necessary skills to understand and
analyze, interpret and evaluate the principles of
tourism. Tourism education enhances the student’s
abilities, enabling them to learn conceptual issues
to contribute to their professional and intellectual
development (Cooper and Shepherd, 1997: 35).
It is defended that human resources are of
great importance in the production and delivery of
services within tourism enterprises and that human
resources within the tourism sector play a key role in
the successful and being a long life of the enterprises
(Lohmann and Jafari, 1995: 491; Baum and Szivas,
2007: 1). The concept of quality improvement
in an increasingly competitive environment has
become an important issue for the tourism sector.
There is an accurate proportional relationship
between the success of the sector and the quality
of the services offered (Augustyn and Ho, 1998:
75). Human resources is one of the most important
parts of tourism enterprises and is the basis thing
of developing the tourism sector. Increasing the

quality of human resources training can gain
competitiveness (Mayaka and King, 2002: 112).
Jenkins (1997: 216) states that businesses in the
tourism sector in any country in the world need
qualified managers and employees, i.e. trained
human resources, to survive in an increasingly
competitive environment.
Solnet (2007: 130-131) states that service
businesses are characterized by the intense
communication that takes place between employees
and customers. Interactions with employees within
the service sector are experiences that customers
remembered best. Employees who are uncomfortable
dealing with customers or lack the training and
expertise to meet customer expectations, cause to
customers remember service experience as a bad
experience.

Cognitive Load Theory
Cognitive load theory assumes that human
cognitive architecture consists of two different types
of memory; limited-capacity working memory
and large-capacity long-term memory. Cognitive
load theory argues that traditional education and
training techniques overload students ‘ working
memory, thus ignoring the structure of human
cognitive architecture. This theory seeks to adapt
educational instructional designs to human
cognitive architecture (Schnotz and Kürschner,
2007: 472-475). The main subject of cognitive
load theory is cognitive load. Every load that
occurs on the cognitive system while performing
the learning activity is defined as cognitive load
(Sweller, Merrienboer, and Paas, 1998: 258). The
theory has three different cognitive loads as a topic
of discussion; extraneous, intrinsic and germane
cognitive loads (Sweller, 2005: 26-27).

Multimedia
Multimedia learning is defined as learning through words and pictures. Multimedia is the simultaneous
use of audio and visual data to achieve higher quality learning (Mayer, 2009: 5). According to Brooks,
Nolan and Gallagher (2002: 13) multimedia is a single medium containing video, audio, text and images.
Multimedia is the use of elements such as Sound, Pictures, Animation, graphics and tables in a computer
environment for a higher quality educational experience.
Table 1. Three Assumptions of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning
Three Assumptions of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning
Dual Channel

People have separate channels for processing audio and visual information.

Limited Capacity

The amount of information that people can process simultaneously on each channel is limited.
People participate in active learning by organizing selected information into compatible mental
representations and integrating mental representations with other information.

Active Processing

According to Mayer (2009: 63), multi-media learning is based on 3 basic assumptions; these are dual
channel, limited capacity, and active processing assumptions. The three assumptions of the cognitive theory
of multimedia learning are given in Table 1 above.

Augmented Reality
Augmented reality (AR) is a technology for displaying virtual objects created via computers on the real
physical environment in real time. As well as virtual reality (VR) technology where the user is in a fully
virtual world, AR enables the user to perceive virtual objects and the real environment as a whole (Zhou, Duh
and Billinghurst, 2008: 193). The concepts of virtual and augmented reality are two different technologies
that are often confused. In order not to confuse these concepts, Milgram and Kishino (1994: 1322) had been
aimed to reveal the differences of these two concepts under the name of “reality-virtuality continuum”.

Figure 1. Reality-Virtuality Continuum

Augmented reality is associated with virtual reality but not exactly the same. While virtual reality creates an
entirely artificial environment, augmented reality enriches the real environment with virtual objects (Höllerer
and Feiner, 2004: 221). Augmented reality is have being used by many different sectors for various purposes.
Juan and Perez (2011: 449) have been used augmented reality technology as a supporting application in
the treatment of fears of acrophobia patients. They point out that augmented reality technology could also
be used in psychological treatments.
Peddie (2017: 89) notes that augmented reality technology, which uses 3-D modeling, offers enormous
opportunities for professional groups such as architecture and engineering.
Kourouthanassis et al., (2015: 80), in their work, they used augmented reality technology as a virtual
guide for tourists in the promotion of the island of “Corfu”, located in Greece. At the end of the study, they
received positive feedback from tourists about augmented reality technology.
The use of augmented reality in education also produces positive results. As an example of these results;
Developing the ability to think in 3D (Ibili and Şahin, 2013: 7), increasing interest in the lesson and focusing
on the subject (Yusoff and Dahlan, 2013: 256), Increasing sensory motor development (Fleck and Simon,
2013: 20) and can be said to reduce cognitive load (Küçük, Yılmaz, Göktaş, 2014: 401). There are augmented
reality applications that can also be used within higher education. It helps students understand concepts
better (Peddie, 2017: 96).

60

Augmented reality technology used by many different sectors has the potential to improve the quality of
tourism education. Research is important in this sense. As it is thought that augmented reality can increase
the quality of Human Resource Education which is of great importance for the tourism sector, this research
aims to reach the views of Tourism academics towards mobile augmented reality technology.

METHOD
In the method part of the research, one-to-one interviews were conducted with 15 academicians working
in the tourism faculties of Anadolu University and Eskişehir Osmangazi University using a semi-structured
interview form. The interview form was taken from the study of Küçük, Yılmaz, and Göktaş (2014) and
made suitable for the field of tourism education by the researcher. According to Türnüklü (2000), the
semi-structured interview technique is one of the data collection techniques suitable for use in educational
sciences. This technique can also provide the researcher with advantages such as asking side questions and
getting more in-depth answers from the participants, depending on the flow of the interview. The case study
pattern from qualitative research methods was used in the study. According to Yıldırım ve Şimşek (2011),
in case studies, a new case is explored in its entirety. The details of the interview are given in Table 2 below.

Tourism academicians interviewed in the scope of the research were asked 8 questions. All interviews
were conducted in the academicians rooms. The interviews were recorded on the researcher’s smartphone
with the permission of the academics and then deciphered by the researcher. The findings were interpreted
by the researcher as strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities under 4 themes.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
In this part of the study, the answers of 15 Tourism academics to 8 interview questions about the use
of mobile augmented reality applications (MAG) in tourism education were gathered under the themes
of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. Table 3 shows the strengths. The views of some
academicians are as follows.

students can learn abstract concepts very easily with this technology.”
P3 “It will simplify the students learning process. In other words, it will enable them to understand a topic
more simply , which makes it easier to understand visually. When animations are into the work, I think it will
makes it easier to learn the subject.”

P14 “It will facilitate the student’s learning effort and shorten the learning time. An application that can
be used anywhere at any time, can learn more efficiently in a shorter time. Student will work with pleasure.
Unfortunately, students don’t even read the books we give, they just memorize powerpoint presentations, but
this technology will help them learn instead of memorizing.”
P2 “I would be happy to use it in class. I think it would make the lesson much more interactive. Who
are we giving the course for, students, in a very general sense that is our customers, this will increase student
satisfaction. Generation z in particular is far ahead of us in technological terms, so augmented reality will meet

it will increase the students ‘ level of achievement, and this will also give me satisfaction, so it would be good
to use this technology.”
P8 “Definitely I think. Tourism sector is an applied sector, there is no point in given education being in a
very conceptual way. Since the past, we have been trying to design tourism education as much as possible to
appeal to more sense organs, so we have internships and so we have practical courses. Tourism geography, tour
planning will be very useful in courses such as.”

P4 “I’d be happy to use this technology . I think it would be more accurate to tell the lessons in the newest
way and to tell them according to Generation z. Giving information through the right sources and the right
channels is very important for the recipient, so I think augmented reality should be used in the lessons.”

the Departments of guidance and gastronomy. Because tourism management is a little more theoretical than
other departments. But it will be useful in practical areas should definitely be used.”
P15 “I consider myself sufficient in terms of using technology, but this is a new technology. I need to get an
education about technology in order to be able to master the level that I can use in my lectures. On the other
hand, the classrooms and the amps in the faculties need to be made suitable, for the use of this technology in
my lectures.”

approaches.”
P1 “Lessons in all areas, should to be somewhat interactive. Although tourism is service-oriented and based
on Human Relations, the use of technological applications is also necessary within tourism. On the one hand,
another characteristic of tourism is that instead of product flow in tourism, the flow of information is intense.
Information flow is provided by information systems. So this means that tourism students should make more
use of information technologies. But on the one hand, that means that also schools and their teachers have to
keep up with it.”

the tourism sector is affected to this situation, therefore the education area of tourism also should be affected. If
this kind of technological applications will not be used in tourism education, the technology should not be used
also in the tourism sector. But these technologies are in the industry as physical evidence.”

You reading with your eyes firstly, secondly you reading with your brain for understand and finally you are
reading while you are writing. Visual training is very useful, but some subjects can’t be worked out just by
watching.”
P10 “I think it should be supported, I think it would be positive, but there is a01
limit to that. Because tourism
is about travelling and seeing, providing experience. Tourism is an abstract concept because it’s in the service
sector, but this and applications like this embody it a little bit. For example, if someone who has never seen
Cappadocia experiences it with augmented reality and it only affects their awareness of the destination, it is
very good. Contrary to the concept of tourism, if it completely assimilates the destination, augmented reality is
not good, making tourism completely digital is not a good thing.”

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In order to increase the quality of tourism education, it is an undeniable fact that tourism education needs
to be kept up to date and supported by the technologies of the age. In this context, in order to increase the
efficiency of tourism education, education needs to be supported by new technological applications such as
mobile augmented reality (MAR).
Tourism academics have stated that they are satisfied with mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications,
that this technology has great opportunities to improve tourism education, and that the use of mobile
augmented reality in Generation z education will produce positive results. It should not be forgotten, that the
success rate achieved as a result of a new application or the use of a new technology in education is directly
proportional to the educators ‘ perspective on the new application or technology and their intention to use it.
It is thought that tourism education needs to be supported by mobile augmented reality (MAR)
technologies in order to increase its effectiveness. It is important to studies on the subject for keep the
subject up to date, to raise awareness and to start using mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications in
tourism education.

ABSTRACT

I

n the process of historical development, many influences such as the location of the cities,
environmental conditions, cultural and social structure have brought different identities to the
cities. However, the urban textures that are worn out over time, and their natural and cultural
landscape characteristics are ignored and reconsidered within the framework of urban renewal causes
this identity to disappear. When we look at the urban renewal projects implemented in our country, the
uniformization that emerges with the implementation of similar projects in different cities, de-identifies
our cities, breaks the ties with nature, leads to many problems from the neighborhood culture to the
weakening of the social texture. In urban renewal projects, it should be taken into consideration that
the natural, cultural and social characteristics of each city and even different areas in the same city are
different from each other.
In this study, the effects of urban renewal projects implemented in different cities (Istanbul and Antalya)
on the city were evaluated through plans, projects and other visuals. It has been found that urban
renewal studies have negative effects on urban identity and memory in the investigated areas. Among
the evaluated urban renewal studies, it was found that social and cultural characteristics of Sulukule
(Istanbul) and natural structure characteristics of Kepez and Santral Districts (Antalya) weren’t taken
into consideration. Therefore, it is important to determine the prominent features of each project area
and to carry out the renewal studies accordingly in terms of preserving the urban identity and memory.
Therefore, urban renewal studies should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team (landscape architect,
architect, civil engineer, urban planner, ecologist, geologist, sociologist, economist) and this process
should be supported by legal arrangements.
With this study, it is aimed to reveal the negative effects of urban renewal studies on urban identity and
memory, which is aimed at transforming the poor quality building stock in our country into places
where people can live safely and without taking into consideration the existing natural and cultural
landscape features of the cities. For this purpose, some suggestions are presented in line with the results
of the study and the principles and aims of urban renewal.
Key Words: Urban Renewal, Urban Identity, Sulukule, Santral District, Istanbul, Antalya

INTRODUCTION
Many influences such as the position of the cities in the historical development process, environmental
conditions, cultural and social structure have brought different identities to the cities. However, the urban
textures that are worn out over time, and their natural and cultural landscape characteristics are ignored
and reconsidered within the framework of urban renewal causes this identity to disappear.
Today, there are many definitions of urban renewal that differ according to their vision, purpose, strategy
and method. According to Lichfield, urban renewal is defined as a compromise over the results of the
renewal that will arise from the need to better understand the processes of urban degradation. According
to Donnison, they are new ways and methods for coordinating the problems concentrating on urban

66

collapse. Urban renewal, as a comprehensive and integrated vision and action, is to ensure the continuous
improvement of the economic, physical, social and environmental conditions of an area. In other words, it
is the re-development and revitalization of a lost economic activity, the functioning of a non-functioning
social function, the provision of social integration in areas with social exclusion, the restoration of this
balance in areas where environmental quality or ecological balance is lost (Roberts 2000, Akkar 2006).
According to Lynch, the characteristics that differentiate cities constitute the identity of the city. It’s the
relationship and interactions between the natural, social and built environment that make up the identity
of the city and differentiate it from the others. The identity of the city, together with the cultural structure
based on natural environmental conditions and the social environment, and the built environment form
together (Suher et al. 2004, Ünlü 2017). Today, when discussing the identity problem in cities, it is important
to address the natural, cultural and social environment together. Turkey has hosted different civilizations
throughout history and in countries with a rich cultural heritage, preservation of history has an important
role in the formation of urban identity tissue, especially on a subject that should be given importance (Zorlu
et al. 2010).
The distinctive features and identities of the cities are decisive. While some cities stand out with
their spatial characteristics, some cities come to the forefront with their socio-cultural characteristics.
However, it is important to establish the relations between them. In other words, according to their natural
characteristics, cities should be formed by artificial elements which are in harmony with the natural features
of the city and they should be adopted and adopted by the people living there. In this case, the identity of
the city, hence the citizen can be mentioned (Can 1999).
Today, population growth and migration cause unplanned growth of cities. New buildings constructed
to meet the increasing housing need are applied without determining the existing natural and cultural
values, are uniformized with the effect of globalization and concrete silhouettes are formed in the city with
increasing floor heights.
Cities that have a certain identity with their unique cultural assets reveal the identity of the streets and
squares. Cities have the characteristics of streets, squares, open spaces and areas where people will come
together, interact and produce urban culture (Güler et al. 2016). While changes and renewals in urban
space are sometimes in the direction of increasing the quality of space and life, they sometimes appear as
economic, social, environmental and physical collapse and degradation of the space (Akkar 2006).
Urban regeneration practices first emerged as a result of the urban growth movements in Europe in the
19th century, as a result of the demolition and reconstruction of some regions (Sisman and Kibaroglu 2009).
While urban renewal in Turkey’s history dates back to the Ottoman Empire, after the fast urbanization
process of change and renewal that began in 1950, it has been shaped by changes observed in European and
American cities (Polat and Dostoglu 2007). Urban regeneration practices started in Ankara in 1990 and
after, and then came to the agenda of Istanbul with the Marmara Earthquake. In recent years, the area of
interest in the renewal has shifted to the slum areas close to the city centers with the enacted laws. Issued in
2012 6306 No. Disaster Risk Areas Under the Law on the Renewal of Turkey has entered into a new renewal
process. In this process, it is aimed to transform the slum areas and areas at risk of disasters and to increase
the living standards of the citizens. However, over time the concentration of the renewal has been directed
towards areas that are planned, but the building stock is worn out, easy to access to the city center, high rent
value, and more profitable and faster profits (Senturk 2014).

MATERIAL AND METOD
Material
The main material of the study is Istanbul Sulukule Urban Renewal Project and Kepez and Santral
Neighborhoods Urban Renewal Project. The selected provinces are among the most important cities which
are prominent with their tourism identity and are visited by local and foreign tourists in terms of their
natural and historical beauties. According to the surveys, the number of tourists coming to Istanbul by
air in 2018 was 12 million 355 thousand 122 and Antalya by 13 million 57 thousand (Anonymous 1 2018,
Anonymous 2 2019). Istanbul, the most populous city of our country, is the fifth most populous city with a
population of 15 million 67 thousand 724 people and Antalya with a population of 2 million 426 thousand
356 (TUİK 2019). In this case, Istanbul almost as much as the population, Antalya is about 6 times as much
as the population of tourists.

Metod
The study was carried out in three directions: land and office. In the first stage, literature surveys about
urban Renewal and urban identity were made and concepts and determinations in this direction were put
forward. In the second stage, the impacts of Sulukule Urban Renewal Project and Antalya Power Plant
Urban Renewal Projects on the city were evaluated through plans, projects and other visuals, and then
these assessments were controlled on-site by observations and investigations in the field. In the last stage
of the study, the negative effects of urban Renewal studies on urban identity and memory were determined
within the scope of tourism and some suggestions were developed in terms of the discipline of landscape
architecture in order to reduce or eliminate these effects.

Urban Renewal Applications in Turkey
Urban renewal has become one of the most talked about and debated issues of urbanization, which became
more visible with the destruction in 1999 Marmara and Düzce Earthquakes (Genç 2008). Urban renewal
works under the name of urban regeneration project have accelerated for various purposes, especially in the
reduction of disaster risks and renewal of slum areas. These studies are being implemented in many urban
areas with the cooperation of local administrations, especially the Housing Development Administration
(TOKİ). In addition to the new local government laws that give the legal basis to the local authorities
for urban regeneration, these practices have been created with the Urban Renewal Law, which aims to
eliminate the unhealthy construction areas of cities, especially natural disaster risks. In addition, urban
renewal practices 2981 numbered Development Amnesty (1984), 3194 numbered Development (1985),

Istanbul Sulukule Urban Renewal Project
Istanbul has been included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO on 06.12.1985 with its 356 list number.
One of the main reasons for Istanbul being included in this list is the Land Walls. Hatice Sultan and Neslisah
Sultan Districts are also located next to the Land Walls (Erturk 2009). Hatice Sultan and Neslişah Sultan
Districts, which are known as Sulukule, but which include an official and more comprehensive region (In
recent years, these two district are merged and referred to as Karagumruk District) (Aktas and Alp 2018),
has been the living space of our citizens of Roman origin for centuries. Roma living in homes of their
parents / grandparents state that they came here with Fatih’s armies (Somersan et al. 2011).
Located within the scope of urban renewal, Sulukule is located in the northwest of Fatih District.
Zeytinburnu is located to the west of the district, Eyup districts are located to the northwest, and the shores
of the Golden Horn to the north and the Marmara Sea to the east (Figure 1).
Sulukule Urban Renewal project area is located in an easily accessible area in terms of highway. The
most important transportation axes in the immediate vicinity of the project area are Fevzi Pasa Street, Vatan
Street and Beylerbeyi Street and are easily accessible from all three streets. The area can be accessed from
the Ankara-Edirne direction D-100 Highway, which is a ring road in the northwest direction, in connection
with the Topcular-Vatan Street Multiple Junction (Erturk 2009).
The Historical Peninsula, which has a history of thousands of years, has served as the capital of the
great civilizations such as Eastern Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Empire and has reached today with the
changing spatial formations under the influence of these civilizations. However, due to various reasons,
many ancient artifacts have been lost, large green areas have been destroyed and there have been great
changes in the social texture.
Sulukule, which is a well-known place both in the city and in the country, was remembered with the
Roma who have been living here for decades and in the past with the entertainment houses that they run
and which have a certain place in the city’s entertainment life. Roma lived mainly within the borders of the
Neslisah district in the south of the area, while traditional Turkish families lived in Hatice Sultan district
in the north. According to Islam (2009), with the closure of entertainment houses, which are the main
source of income in the region in the 1990s, it is understood that the region has entered into a ratification
process. According to Islam (2009), with the closure of entertainment houses, which are the main source
of income in the region in the 1990s, it is understood that the region has entered into a ratification process.
Sulukule was a very stigmatized region in the eyes of large sections. Until recently, the region served as
property and rent values that were well below the market averages and cheap housing stock for low income
(Islam 2009).
Sulukule’s place in the city during the Ottoman period: It is known that Roma have a great place in
Ottoman entertainment culture. Although the novels weren’t officially present in the Ottoman Palace
entertainments, in some cases they took part in sultan entertainments and circumcision feasts. Even though
the tradition of Entertainment Arms during the Ottoman period experienced its most magnificent periods,
it is possible to say that Sulukule contributed to the city in many ways besides dance and music. After the
conquest of Istanbul, the Romans, who were Muslims, established the palace mehter team. It is known that
the best, richest mules and baskets of Istanbul also emerged from Sulukule (Meric et al. 2006).
Sulukule’s place in the city during the Republican period: In the periods after the proclamation of the
Republic, the tradition of Entertainment Arms continued. Beler (1946) Sulukule Entertainment Houses,
furnished with a simple decor and clean room, singing and dancing (Meriç et al. 2006).
While Vatan Street was being built, part of the city walls in Edirnekapi and 29 houses in Sulukule
were destroyed. A large part of their houses have been demolished and the people of Sulukule have fused
with the Haticesultan and Neslisahsultan districts, which have settled along the walls, sliding towards
the top and walls. In order to keep in touch with each other, the residents of the destroyed old Sulukule
houses established the Sulukule Tourism Survival and Protection Association in 1969 with the support
01a one-month International
of the Ministry of Tourism. During this period, the Association organized
Gigan Festival with the participation of novels from the Balkans and European countries. Sulukule, the
establishment of a new Roma neighborhood and reunion efforts were unsuccessful when the association
was dissolved. In 1985, Sulukules applied to the Ministry of Tourism with the “Show Houses Project”.
However, despite the Ministry’s positive approach to the project, this initiative wasn’t successful when
it wasn’t accepted by the local government. Although the Show Houses Project wasn’t implemented, the
“Entertainment Houses”, known as three, reached thirty-four during this period. These enterprises were

69

4th International Tourism Congress

semi-legal. Entertainment Houses, which symbolize the water and Roman culture, were completely closed
in 1990s for various reasons and entertainment activities were stopped. Therefore, the differentiation of
Sulukule region within the entertainment sector in the 1960s started to differentiate once the entertainment
places were closed. However, the population structure in the neighborhood has not changed, but due to the
closure of entertainment venues, the region has been dragged into a big and rapid collapse (Ertürk 2009).
Within the scope of the urban renewal project carried out by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality,
Fatih Municipality and TOKİ, which was adopted in 2005, covering Neslisah and Hatice Sultan Districts,
more than 300 buildings were demolished and 640 houses were built in place (Figure 2) (Isikcevahir 2017).
When the old and new zoning plans of Sulukule, which is declared as a renewal area by the Council
of Ministers based on the law numbered 5366, are compared, the old zoning plan includes 7 parks, 2
educational institutions, 1 tourism facility, 3 religious facilities and building islands, In the new zoning
plan, there are 4 parks, 1 educational institution, 2 tourism facilities, 2 trade areas, 3 religious facilities
and building islands (Figure 3). According to the changes made in the zoning plans, the increase in the
building areas and the decrease in the number of parks and areas are noteworthy. In addition, it is thought
that the addressing of the parks to certain regions within the building islands rather than the common
use leads to significant changes on the identity of the region. The decrease in the number of educational
institutions, the increase in tourism facilities and commercial areas indicate that the characteristics of the
region have changed.

Antalya Kepez Santral District Urban Renewal Project
Depending on the movement of urbanization in the world and in Turkey, Antalya city’s social, cultural,
physical, altered quickly economically advanced and differentiated. It is observed that the process of
urbanization in Antalya shape depending on the political and spatial decisions in Turkey. The urbanization
process in Antalya city is in parallel with our other cities, rapid population growth, environmental pollution,
transportation, visual pollution, housing need, urban identity, inadequate green areas, destruction of
environmental resources and values to be protected, slum housing, city center problems are seen as common
problems and solution proposals is being developed (Manavoglu 2009).
Within the scope of Law No. 6306 on Disposal Renewal of Areas under Disaster Risk, which is 132.7
hectares, owned by Antalya Metropolitan Municipality and determined within the boundaries of Kepez
Santral District, in accordance with the decision of Council of Ministers dated 24.12.2014 and numbered
2014/7041, Pursuant to the decision of the Council of Ministers, it was published in the Official Gazette
dated 25.12.2014 and numbered 29216 and declared as ‘Risky Area. Following the decision of the Council
of Ministers, planning and project studies were initiated by the Municipality.
The information about the Urban Renewal Project of Antalya Kepez Santral District is summarized
below in line with the Explanation and Justification Report for the Area in Accordance with the Law No.
6306 on the Renewal of Areas at Disaster Risk obtained from the Directorate of Urban Renewal Branch
(Antalya Buyuksehir Belediyesi 2014).
The development of slum in the city of Antalya dates back to the late 1950s. The first mass and dense
slums, especially in the northwest of the city which has developed in every way, has developed simultaneously
with the establishment of factories. Ferrochrome Factory in 1957, in 1961 with the establishment of the
Weaving Factory and Kepez Hydroelectric Power Plant and manufacturing industry with the development
of Kepez, Ahatlı, Erenköy slum districts were formed to meet the need for housing. Kepez Santral District
is among the old slum of Antalya.
The Project Area is the area of Antalya Burdur Highway in the east, Ferrochrome Factory in the south,
Prison and Ünsal District, Forest Area and Zoo in the north, Forest and Kepez Hydroelectric Power Plant
in the west (Figure 4). The area where the site is located and the 1st degree natural site, the Vakıf Zeytinligi
land is the urban renewal impact area. Kepez Santral District is located in the old slums of Antalya province.
Kepez Santral District although it is one of the first areas that have an impact on the identity of the city
in terms of its location, it is known as a settlement area with low quality of construction and inadequate
in terms of infrastructure and infrastructure due to its slum settlement area (Mansuroglu et al. 2018). For
these reasons, it was decided to implement urban renewal (Figure 5 and Figure 6).

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Especially after 1980, large scale national and international capital housing projects are in the forefront
of profit motive, against unnecessary expansion of cities, destruction of cultural, historical and natural
riches, against the principle of economic, social and environmental sustainability, inefficient use of public
resources, as well as waste has led to the proliferation of urban spaces that increase social inequality,
exclusion and polarization. The urban spaces formed due to these reasons need renewal and renewal. In
almost every province in our country, there are areas where crime rates that don’t comply with regular
urban development, lack of technical infrastructure and other equipment, are economically weak and
socially collapsed. These areas really need urban renewal.
When we look at the urban renewal projects implemented in our country, the uniformization that
emerges with the implementation of similar projects in different cities, de-identifies our cities, breaks the
ties with nature, leads to many problems from the neighborhood culture to the weakening of the social
texture. The effects of urban renewal examples in Istanbul and Antalya are presented in (Table 1).

redesigned as an empty land. In this way, the traditional street texture and the layout of the building
island were disrupted, the parcels from the history to the present day were eliminated, and the

were changed.

without walls around the tissue brought to the region and can be defined as a physical environment
for the housing expectations of the upper class. This change in the physical structure of Sulukule
means the destruction of the urban and architectural heritage of the neighborhood, which has
had its own unique texture for centuries. In addition to the elimination of the examples of civil
architecture, an important construction activity was carried out in the vicinity of the Land Walls,
which is one of the World Heritage List areas of Istanbul and including the wall protection band.
With the uniformization of the new structures, the existing identity in the field has been damaged.

construction of the project. The forested area to the north of the area is at risk with increasing
housing demand. Failure to consider existing plants in the area during the application process is a
factor in the loss of existing tissue.
It is seen that the urban renewal studies implemented in Istanbul Sulukule and Antalya Kepez Santral
District isn’t compatible with the urban renewal purposes.
While these projects are expected to establish a relationship between the physical conditions of the city
and its social problems, it is seen that an effort has been made for gentrification. It is thought that this
situation will cause social problems such as unemployment and inability to adapt to the people leaving the
region. Consequently, adversities will be experienced in terms of increasing urban welfare and quality of life.
Urban renewal projects aiming to require a physical change process in the urban fabric lead to the
change of urban texture and silhouette with intensive construction in Antalya Kepez Santral District.
In terms of contributing to the maintenance of urban identity in Sulukule and Antalya Kepez and
Santral Neighborhoods;
- Implementations that will reveal the impact of the Land Walls around Sulukule and ensure that the
walls aren’t damaged,
- Keeping the culture of entertainment houses alive, maintaining the novel culture and making use of
alternative tourism opportunities,
- Appropriate landscaping in order to break the impact of high-rise buildings in Antalya Kepez and
Santral Neighborhoods and reduce the impact of urban heat island,
- To take necessary measures to prevent the olive groves and forested areas located near the Antalya
Kepez and Santral Neighborhoods project area to be affected by new projects,
- Painting the previous silhouettes of the neighborhoods on the walls of various buildings (transformers,
mukhtar buildings, etc.) to be constructed in both project areas,
- Including museum-like works in the districts exhibiting traditional life,
- Identifying and using previously grown plants in the region, especially in landscape applications,
- It is important to include original designs that reflect the previous characteristics of the neighborhoods
in urban reinforcement elements (bench, trash bin, lighting element, flooring materials, manhole
covers, stops, etc.).
As a result, in urban renewal projects, taking into consideration that the natural, cultural and social
characteristics of each city and even different areas in the same city are different from each other, it is
important to make different projects for each urban renewal area in order to preserve the identity gained by
the cities and transfer them to future generations.

ABSTRACT

T

ransformational learning is emerging as a fundamental topic in travel and tourism research.
Individual’s views of the world are changed by travelling as a result of transformative learning.
According to the transformational learning theory, what triggers transformation is to encounter
new and unexpected phenomena, and consequently, for the individual to create a dilemma. This is
because transformational travel differs from ordinary travels that offer a temporary getaway from the
routine. The purpose of this study is to understand what individuals are learnt by travelling and how their
views of world changed. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with twenty-two travellers were carried
out. According to interviews, travel experiences seem to increase skills development by encouraging
individuals to struggle harder in their own lives. Furthermore, individuals have been found to have
more awareness and developing self-confidence about their lives.
Keywords: Transformative Learning, Transformational Travel, Transformational Tourism

INTRODUCTION
In tourism literature, it has been known that there is a positive and strong bond among traveling, learning,
development and individual transformation. Relationship between traveling and learning, which began in
the 17th and 18th centuries when European aristocracy commenced to participate in the Grand Tour for
education (Towner, 1985), was started to appear among the subcultures that emerged between the working
class and the middle class in the second half of the 20th century. Cohen’s (1973) “vagabonds” drifters,
who emphasized traveling as a way to gain experience about life, and Vogt (1976) had hippie travelers
called globetrotters “wanderers” had many different motivations such as escape, novelty, relaxing which
allows them to leave their residences to hit the roads and travel for a long time. One of these motivations is
learning motivation. In the 80s, the vagabond discourse associated with hippiness was left to the backpacker
(Cohen, 2004). Though they generally lose their value in relation to the hippie movement, travel has been
regarded as an important means of gaining vital experience and remains as the core values of rejection of
mass tourism.
Towards the end of the 20th Century, especially in the late 20th Century, as people have more free
time, and the increase in their income and the opportunity to travel enable more people to travel and offer
them opportunity to develop intellectual sense (Bodger, 1998). According to Falk et al. (2012) today, mass
tourism and associated tourism activities still remain updated, but also leave room for changing travel and
leisure time patterns. From this point of view, it is possible to say that tourism and travel have become an
important means by which people can learn, develop ideas and create new perspectives.
In the daily discourse, this phenomenon is not as interesting as other areas in the tourism literature (Falk
et al., 2012), although it is thought to be an enlightening experience for travellers to travel (Martín-Cabello
and García-Manso, 2015). But recently, the scientific literature has begun to investigate the qualifications
gained through travel. According to Jang and Cai (2002), the relationship between people’s motivations and

74

their choice of destination is crucial in predicting
their future travels. The issues that tourists
possess (such as culture, demography, experience,
personality, social capital, etc.) and the issues of
destinations (activities, services, management,
environment, infrastructure etc.) provide us to
understand the sense of tourist’s travel decisions
and what kind of tourism they will experience in
destinations. Tourists are getting some output from
the social, cultural and environmental interactions
in their destinations. These are satisfaction, pleasure,
complaint, health, skill development and learning
etc. (Pearce, 2005). Learning motivation (Niggel and
Benson, 2008), which is one of the many motivations
that nowadays attract travellers from their homes,
is also a result of travel experiences. Studies have
shown that travellers also have different learning
outcomes that enhance their general skills beyond
cultural and environmental learning (Pearce and
Foster, 2007; Martín-Cabello and García-Manso,
2015). Furthermore, Pearce’s fourteen factors,
which represent the basic motivations of tourists in
the travel career path theory developed by Maslow’s
Basic Needs Hierarchy model, relate to these outputs.
For example; the motivations of self-development,
self-enhancement and self-actualization in Pearce’s
model overlap with learning output (Falk et al.,
2012). Richards and Wilson (2004) in a study they
conducted with from travelers with backpacks
received responses about their travel motivations
such as “discovering other cultures” and “interacting
with people from other countries”, “raising the level
of knowledge” and “developing general skills”.
Pearce (2005) finds travellers whose cognitive
status is mindfulness, obtain more learning, higher
satisfaction, and a more developed understanding of
their travels, by taking the concept of mindfulness
(conscious awareness) in psychology. Likewise,
Moscardo (1996) describes the concept of
mindfulness as “being open to learning, relating to
the surrounding area and creating and developing
new routines”. When we examine both the historical
process and the motivational and cognitive
situations of travellers, it is possible to state that the
relationship between travel and learning is more
concerned with more individual and independent
travellers, especially in the last period.
According to Wilson (1993), learning involves
both what is happening in the individual and what
is connected with the person’s surroundings and
life experiences. Therefore, if learning represents an
important result of the individual’s life experiences
and therefore the tourist experience, it is necessary
for tourism providers and researchers to understand
the basis of human learning. (Falk et al., 2012).

LITERATURE REVIEW
Tourism is an effective instrument that transforms
thoughts and behaviors of people during and after
travel (Lean, 2009, 2012; Lean, Staiff and Waterton,
2014). Describing transformational tourism as
an outcome of the tourism experience, Christie
and Mason (2003) have defined transformational
tourism as a “tourism activity that leads to a positive
change on the attitudes and values of individuals
who gain the touristic experience.” Similarly, the
concept of transformational travel is also used to
describe travels carried out with a motivation for
self-improvement such as to do self-exploration, to
develop a sensitivity for visited places, and to search
for deeper meanings on a journey (Tomljenovic
and Ateljevic, 2015). Ross (2010) has defined
travel as “a comprehensive, individually-tailored,
private and fun way, when carried out consciously,
to give the individual self-awareness and spiritual
experience and to increase his awareness.” Within
the transformational learning framework, Ross
(2010) has defined transformational travel as “a
sustainable journey initiated by the traveler in
order to create conditions suitable for transforming
one or more main characteristic of the individual
(emotional, cognitive, physical, and spiritual).” The
theory of transformative learning, first introduced
by Mezirow in 1978, is for individuals to learn
how to question their own ideologies, beliefs, and
perspectives for personal development in line with
their own will and goals. Individuals are expected
to transform their experiences into new meaningful
perspectives by the end of the transformative
process (Akpınar, 2010). In order for this process to
be initiated, certain travel conditions triggering the
process are necessary. The first step of this process is
called “disorienting dilemmas” (Mezirow, 1978). For
example, if a person encounters a different culture,
a physical environment, or social habits, this
leads to a cognitive dissonance in which he or she
cannot adapt to the current reference framework
or worldview. Thus, a dilemma is formed that will
lead to the reshaping of reference frames — in
other words, semantic structures (Reisinger, 2013a).
According to Mezirow (1991), the self-confidence
and competency development of the individual
constitutes the final stage of this process. According
Tomljenovic and Ateljevic (2015), in order for the
01 it must be independent
transformation to begin,
and it must take place through motivations such
as transformation, learning, integration with local
culture, and participation in activities that push the
individual to think.

Ross (2010) has stated that experiences such as
the following can be transformative: when traveling,
to stay in holy places; to participate in rituals and
ceremonies; to be in nature and to connect with
it; to participate in sustainable practices; to learn
esoteric stories; to participate in group activities
such as yoga, meditation, art and so forth to discover
oneself; to learn from local teachers; to perform
physically challenging activities; and to provide
voluntary community services.
In conclusion, new circles allow the individual
to gain new perspectives by offering new stimuli
that can somehow force him or her. According
to the transformational learning theory, what
triggers transformation is to encounter new and
unexpected phenomena, and consequently, for
the individual to create a dilemma. This is because
transformational travel differs from ordinary travels
that offer a temporary getaway from the routine. It
offers an understanding that allows the traveler to
transform. In order to understand transformation
related to travel experience, it is necessary for
travelers to understand these dilemmas they have
experienced, how these dilemmas are solved and
what the consequences are. Travelers, as a result of
important travel events, experience deep personal
and perceptual changes. Transformative learning
takes place through experience, crisis and reflection,
all of which are often linked to travel. In this respect,
the transformational learning theory will be able to
establish a suitable framework for investigating the
transformative power of tourism.

METHODOLOGY
The purpose of the study is to try to understand
how the travels lead to a change in the individuals.
From this point, the research question is developed
as what kind of changes occur in the individual
travelers as a result of their travels? In this study,
phenomenological design was used as qualitative
research methods. The phenomenological approach
emphasizes the experience itself and how experience
transforms into consciousness (Merriam, 2009).
Therefore, in order to search for answers to the
question of the study, a phenomenological pattern
was used in order to understand in depth what is
the change in themselves after traveling based on
people’s travel experiences. In the study, purposive
sampling was used which was formed by 22 people
who have experienced frequent individual travels
before. No constraints were sought other than
the travel experiences of the participants and no
demographic limitation was introduced.

76

Data Collection
Data were collected using an interview method to
reach participants’ experiences with their travel
experiences and their experiences with subsequent
changes (Creswell, 2014). Although negotiations
were conducted within semi-structured questions,
participants were given the flexibility to describe
their experience with the journey and its subsequent
changes. All interviews were recorded with voice
recorder and transcribed by researchers in writing.
The interviewees were asked two questions:
t

“Considering your previous travel experiences.
do you think travelling is instructive?
What do you think your travels have taught you?”
t i)PX IBT MFBSOŔOH UISPVHI USBWFM DIBOHFE
you?”

FINDINGS
In the interviews, rich data were obtained by the
individual travellers about the changes that occurred
as a result of their travel experiences were subjected
by the thematic analysis and the changes after the
travel. The themes were defined by the researchers
as categorical aggregation and grouping of data.
Individual transformation based on a post-travel
learning was analysed in three themes: Awareness,
self-confidence and skills development.
Awareness: The travelers had a common opinion
that the act of traveling had an instructive nature.
Traveling led individuals to learn by offering
them experiences. The most dominant instructive
characteristic of traveling was the discovery of
cultural differences and the outside world. With travel
as a tool, individuals began to realize the outside
world by moving away from their lantern of life.
The meanings of such phenomena, such as different
forms of life, cultural and geographical structure,
and political and social life, were experienced by
confronting what was real, unlike what people
learned in lectures and in books. Therefore,
experiencing different lives and witnessing the
outside world paved the way for the travelers to
create an awareness. The participants achieved a
personal transformation by developing an awareness
of both their own selves and the outside world.

in Australia or in the West we have very lucky

the problem is that is makes you feel like you
can do anything but makes you not very happy

that before I was in a certain illusion and
something in this trip has changed it. I think I
am more aware in certain aspects in the reality
of the way I look at things…”
Skills development: The travelers had a number
of anticipations or plans about the travel, especially
before they traveled. During the times of travel,
they were experiencing involuntary changes in
planned activities or they encountered spontaneous
situations in visited regions. The travelers often
encountered situations that were challenging and
that required effort. At times, during the exploration
of unknown places, the course of the journey was
evolving spontaneously, and the traveler kept
pace with that journey. It was understood that the

travelers improved their communication skills,
problem-solving skills and life skills in such cases
— occurring spontaneously, as a prerequisite of
traveling as a traveler.

t “You go out of your house and your country

lot of money, so we have to deal what we have

Self-confidence: When the travelers began to
cope with challenging situations that they faced
along the way, or when they communicated again
and again with new people, this experience put
them into a cyclical learning event. As a result,
they drew conclusions from every experience, and
their acquisitions in this process contributed to the
development of their self-confidence.

CONCLUSION
This study aimed to understand what travelers learn
and how they are personally transformed when
traveling. Travel and tourism have an instructive,
and thus, a transformative effect on travelers.
Consequently, some changes occur in travelers as a
result of their travels.
According to the literature, travel provides
personal and spiritual development, enhances
awareness, and builds self-confidence and self-esteem
(Gmelch, 1994; Wearing, 2001; Inkson and Myers,
2003; Pearce and Foster, 2007; Scarinci and Pearce,
2012). Theoretically, in order for the transformation
to be accomplished, the person is expected to widen
his or her worldview, improve his or her awareness
and skills, and gain awareness (Mezirow, 1994;
Reisinger, 2013). The findings obtained in this study
showed that travel experiences of the travelers granted
them awareness and self-confidence, and that the
travelers had become more sensitive individuals after
their travel experiences. Moreover, according to the
findings, the “skill development” emerged to be an
important outcome of the traveler experience.
When considered in the context of the concept
of transformational tourism/travel, it is important
for travelers to become more sensitive individuals,
to improve their environmental awareness, and
to develop intercultural respect and empathy, as a
result of their travel experiences, in order to create a
better world by establishing a sustainable concept of
tourism. These results will help us to have a deeper
understanding of travel-related studies, focusing
on post-travel individual transformation, and will
contribute to travelling research.

ABSTRACT

T

he main purpose of this study is to reveal the factors affecting the brand loyalty of the residents
in Eskisehir. In the recommended model, social life, environment, international recognition and
traffic dimensions are investigated. Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to investigate the
relationships between the factors in the recommended model. The validity of the model was evaluated
according to the compliance criteria in the literature. Since the chi-square value was calculated as 169,75
and (χ2 / sd) value was 3,086. It was decided that the model was valid. As a result of the research; the
proposed model was adopted. In addition, statistically significant relationships were found between the
variables. In this context, this study was supported current literature.
Keywords: City Brand, Life Quality, Structural Equation Model.

INTRODUCTION
All people living in community deserve a quality life. It is a natural and basic right of people to expect a high
quality of life from the city they live in (Rogerson, 1999). If the quality of life is defined as being satisfied
with the life and feeling good; the quality of urban life can be defined as the satisfaction of people with the
living standards offered by cities and the conditions that make them feel good in the environment they live
in. (Yavuzcehre and Torlak, 2006:184).
When a city becomes a brand, it means that the city is different from other cities in terms of cultural,
social, commercial and political aspects and that people have a positive thinking in their minds. (Demirgunes
and Avcilar, 2014: 558). The concept of city brand “instead of perceiving a particular city as an ordinary
settlement in the minds of people, by using brand strategies and techniques; all activities carried out to
transform individuals into attraction living centers that they would like to continue their lives, work, invest,
receive education and visit” (Dinnie, 2011:7).
Some factors need to be provided to create a good city brand. When the literature is examined, the
main elements of the city brand come out as social life quality, local government, cultural opportunities,
job opportunities, international recognition, food culture, quality of education and environment, and
transportation convenience. It is important that these factors, which are closely related to each other, should
be evaluated separately and the contribution of these elements is considered as very important in raising the
brand value of the city (Dinnie, 2011; Huang et al., 2013: 663; Noni et al., 2014: 218-226; Demirgunes and
01
Avcilar, 2014: 557; Avcilar and Kara, 2015:77).
In this research, the factors affecting the urban brand loyalty of the people living in Eskisehir were
investigated based on the examples of the city brand. Factors such as quality of life, environmental quality,
traffic comfort and international recognition, which are thought to be effective in life satisfaction and city
brand, were presented to the evaluation of the people living in Eskisehir. The scarcity of research on this
subject adds to the original value and importance of the research.

LITERATURE REVIEW

METHOD

The brand is defined as a name, term, word, icon,
design, sign and shape that distinguishes a product from its competitors. (Kotler and Armstrong,
2017:248-249). City branding (city branding) is defined as all activities carried out to transform people into attraction life centers that they want to live,
work, invest, receive education and visit by using
brand strategies and techniques (Dinnie, 2011:7).
When the literature is examined, it is seen that the
city brand is an important concept for tourism.

The structural equation modelling is considered as a
statistical method for examining multiple relationships between variables. Therefore, structural equation modelling was used in this study.

Noni et al. (2014) introduced practical
applications for local and global destination
marketing and management, focusing on efforts
to improve perceived image to increase interest in
Milan. In their study, a structural equation model
was applied to evaluate the attractive aspects of
the city. The results of the research show that
culture and education are the most prominent
features of Milan. It has been determined that the
attitudes towards city brand have less but positive
effects on social opportunities, health, tourism and
internationalization level.
In a study conducted by Demirgunes and
Avcilar (2014), it has been shown that the residents
of the brand cities are more satisfied than the
others. In this study, satisfaction levels of residents
in Osmaniye were examined. It was stated that the
most important factor determining the satisfaction
of Londoners is the living conditions. Yavuzcehre
and Torlak (2006) stated that rapid technological
change, global competition and political turmoil
put great pressure on cities. In this research, the
necessity and importance of creating city brands
which are influenced by external factors and the
attempts to become a center of attraction were
mentioned. Determining the quality of life of people
living in a city is decisive for both marketing and
brand loyalty (Karamustafa, Gullu and Acar, 2010).
In the research conducted by Avcilar and Kara
(2015), it was stated that the studies to create a city
brand are a great investment in the future of all the
citizens living in the city and even in that country
or city. In recent years city marketing and city
brand have become one of the sub-disciplines of
marketing. In the study conducted by X and y for
Adiyaman, it was determined that city branding
is a very important economic income provider for
the residents (Akci and Uluisik, 2016). Thus, it is
very important to find out the factors affecting the
brand loyalty of residents in Eskisehir both for local
governments and for the literature.

Data Collection Tools and Sample
In this study, the population of the research was
made up of residents in Eskisehir between 20162017. The stratified sampling method was used as
the sampling type of this study. The study was conducted with a face-to-face interview with 370 people
living in Osmangazi, Visnelik, Akarbasi, Yenikent,
Uluonder, Baglar, Alanonu, and Batikent districts,
which are assumed to have different socio-economic
structures in different geographical locations of Eskisehir. The number of units in the respective districts is 100, 40, 30, 30, 100, 20, 50. The measurement
instrument developed was based on the literature
(Noni et al., 2014; Demirgunes and Avcilar, 2014).
The survey used in the research consists of two sections. The first section of the survey form consisted
of age, sex, marital status, education level, monthly
income, how many years the participant has lived in
Eskisehir. In the second section the items related to
the quality of urban life and satisfaction from Eskisehir were measured by using a five-point Likert-type scale. The survey was measured with a five-point Likert scale ranging from “5: Strongly agree / 1:
Strongly disagree”.
Within the scope of the research, firstly pilot
study was applied to 50 people living in Eskisehir.
After the pilot study, the questionnaire was finalized.
The questionnaires were conducted on 1 April 2017
- 7 May 2017. The reliability of the scale used in the
study was calculated as 0.924.

The Research Model and
Hypotheses
The model examined in the research is based on the
studies of Noni et al. (2014) and Demirgunes and
Avcilar (2014). In the research model, the quality of
social life, the quality of the city environment, the
international recognition of the city and the ease of
traffic of the city were determined as external latent
variables and city commitment as internal latent variable (Figure 1).

Analysis Results of the Structural Equation Modelling
Firstly, the LISREL software was used for testing the suitability of the data to the multivariate normal distribution for the selection of the appropriate parameter estimation method. Since chi-square value = 777,836
(p <0,01) was calculated for multivariate normality symmetry and kurtosis, it was concluded that the data
set was not normally distributed. For this reason, Robust Maximum Likelihood method was used as parameter estimation method (Table 2).

Structural equation modelling analysis basically consists of two stages. First, the model, which is
expressed as a measurement model in terms of verification of the factor structure, is tested with the analysis
of the data. Then, the causal relationship between external latent variables and internal latent variables is
tested with the structural model. Therefore, first level factor analysis (CFA) was performed to confirm the
factor structure in the research model. The results of the CFA analysis showed that the 5-factor structure
was valid.

According to the results shown in Figure 2, a statistically significant correlation was found between
social life quality and city brand loyalty variables. This value indicates that one-unit change in the Social
Life Quality will result in 0.24 changes in city brand loyalty. A statistically significant correlation was
found between environmental quality and city brand loyalty variables. This value indicates that one unit
change in environmental quality will result in 0.14 changes in city brand loyalty. A positive statistically
significant relationship was found between international recognition and city brand loyalty variables. This
value indicates that one unit of change in international recognition will be 0.17 units of change in city
brand loyalty. Similarly, a positive statistically significant relationship was found between traffic comfort
and city brand loyalty variables. This value indicates that one-point increase in traffic comfort will result in
an increase of 0.16 points in city brand loyalty.

When Table 4 and 5 are examined, it is seen
that all hypotheses are supported. When Table 5 is
analysed, it can be said that the 30% change in city
brand loyalty is explained by the variables of social
life quality, environmental quality, international
recognition and traffic quality.

This research was conducted for city residents
in Eskisehir. Because those who know a city in the
best way live there. However, it is thought that the
perception of Eskisehir in future studies will be
measured and compared with the findings of this
study will contribute to the literature.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION

REFERENCES

In this study, factors that affect city brand loyalty
of residents in Eskisehir were investigated using a
proposed research model and SEM. The research model includes factors such as social quality of
life, environmental quality, international recognition and traffic comfort. In the study, a statistically
significant positive correlation was found between
social quality of life and city brand loyalty variables.
It is understood that as the social activities offered
by the city to students, the disabled and the elderly
increase, the brand loyalty of the city will increase. A
statistically significant correlation was found between environmental quality and city brand loyalty variables. Increasing the number of green spaces in the
city, decreasing the air pollution, taking the necessary measures against environmental pollution of
the municipalities will increase the brand loyalty of
the residents.
A positive statistically significant relationship
was found between international recognition and
city brand loyalty variables. As the international
reputation of the city and the international events
organized in the city increase, the loyalty of the
residents to the city will increase.
In the study, a positive statistically significant
relationship was found between traffic comfort and
city brand loyalty variables. The convenience of
pedestrians with the means of transportation in the
city, appropriate level of public transportation fees,
sufficient number of parking lots positively affects
the city brand loyalty of residents.
According to these results, local governments
who want to create city brands should give
importance to social life quality, environmental
quality, traffic and internationalization factors
(Dinnie, 2011; Demirgunes and Avcilar, 2014;
Avcilar and Kara, 2015). In this context, this study
was supported the literature. In besides, the brand of
city is crucial to tourism (Herget, Petru and Abrham,

ABSTRACT

T

his study aims to propose a resource-based approach to the development of gastronomy tourism
in city destinations. For this purpose, the case of Gaziantep is examined as an important
gastronomy tourism destination of Turkey. Gaziantep is included in UNESCO Creative Cities
Network in the field of gastronomy with its rich culinary heritage and therefore, the city presents a
relevant case to examine the culinary resources from the resource-based view. The data rely on the
documents gathered from the reports, statistics, web pages of various stakeholders, media news and
academic studies on gastronomy tourism in the city. Analysis of the documents shows that gastronomy
tourism resources of Gaziantep could be classified as facilities, activities, events, and organizations. In
addition, five governmental principles for promoting gastronomy tourism are identified; (i) developing
projects for sustainable development; (ii) maintaining coordination between industry stakeholders; (iii)
implementing initiatives to achieve the objectives of the UCCN; (iv) building the brand of gastronomy
tourism destination; and (v) constructing educational environment for gastronomy and tourism.
Keywords: Gastronomy Tourism, Creative Cities, UNESCO, Gaziantep, Resource-based View

INTRODUCTION
Tourist destinations consists of various tangible and intangible products and services. Food is one of these
important resources. In recent years, there is an increasing awareness about the role of gastronomy in the process
of developing tourism in countries, regions and cities. Gastronomic experiences are important attractions of
destinations (Kozak & Rimmington, 1999: 280; Enright & Newton, 2004: 783) which affect destination choice
(Kivela & Crotts, 2006: 372), satisfaction level and revisit intention of travellers (Rimmington & Yüksel, 1998:
48-52). Food and culinary culture of destinations also represent intangible heritages and have unique features
with their local characteristics. Therefore, gastronomy tourism represents an emerging tourism market for
many countries or regions and creates a unique source of competitive advantage for tourist destinations
(Horng & Tsai, 2012). Destinations that are aware of this role of cuisine have begun to use their gastronomic
elements in their promotions and positioning in the broader tourism market.
UNESCO initiated a Creative Cities Network (UCCN) in 2004 which aims to strengthen creativity and
innovation and promote cooperation with and among member cities. The Network covers seven creative
fields (crafts and folk art, design, film, gastronomy, literature, media arts, and music) that cities could use
for sustainable urban development. Cities that benefit from their gastronomic products creatively in their
development plans are included in the creative field of gastronomy in UCCN list. There are, currently, 26
gastronomy cities from 17 countries. Gaziantep from Turkey was designated a city of gastronomy in 2015
by UCCN. In this study, we have adopted a resource-based approach to the development of tourism in city
destinations and examined the case of Gaziantep as an important destination for gastronomy tourism. We
aimed to discuss the process of developing gastronomy tourism as a way of achieving sustainable competitive
advantage. Although the positive impact of gastronomic products on tourism activities is widely accepted
in the literature, there is still a paucity to explain its contribution to the competitiveness of destinations. In
an aim of addressing this paucity, the resource-based view (RBV) has been adapted to gastronomy tourism
resources since the RBV brings meaningful explanations to the process of achieving competitive advantage
in the field of strategic management.

LITERATURE REVIEW
In order to understand the process of tourism
development in cities, the resources of destinations
should be examined with an academic approach. The
RBV strives to explain the competitive advantage
in the field of strategic management and focuses
on the internal resources of the firms. The level of
analysis, however, has been expanded and the view
has eventually become popular for understanding
city or regional competitiveness. The theoretical
foundations and explanations of the approach
have been reviewed in the following section
with the aim of adapting its arguments to tourist
destinations. Destinations have various resources.
Gastronomy has been selected in this study and
later, the relationship among gastronomy, tourism
and destinations has been established through the
studies in the literature.

Resource-based view
Schools of strategic management have developed
various explanations to the questions of what is
the source of competitive advantage and how it is
sustained. The resource-based view analyses firms
from the resource side (Wernerfelt, 1984: 171)
and claims that the competitive advantage is due
to their specific resources and competencies. The
view has two main assumptions (Barney, 1991:
101); resources are heterogeneous in nature and
not perfectly mobile across firms. These resources
could include all assets, organizational capabilities,
human resources, information, knowledge, etc. but
not all firm resources provide the firm a sustained
advantage in competitiveness. Barney (1991)
developed a theoretical framework for discussing
the potential of resources for a sustained competitive
advantage. According to this framework, a firm
resource must have four attributes (valuable, rare,
imperfectly imitable, and not substitutable) for
generating competitive advantage.
Value. Barney (1991: 106) explains that firm
resources can only be a source of competitive
advantage if they are valuable; and resources could
be considered valuable when they contribute to
efficiency and effectiveness of a firm. Considering the
traditional “strengths-weaknesses-opportunitiesthreats” model, resources that reduce the impact of
threats while creating opportunities could improve
the firm performance and they could be regarded as
valuable resources.
Rareness. The second requirement for strategic
resources is that the resource should be rare. If a
large number of firms possess valuable resources,

then they could not generate a competitive
advantage (Barney, 1991). Resources which are not
commonly found or possessed by competitors are
rare resources.
Imperfect imitability. Valuable and rare resources
are sources of competitive advantage if they could
not be imitated by the organizations which do not
possess these resources. Barney (1991: 107-11) argues
that strategic resources of organizations could not be
imitated for one or a combination of three reasons.
First, firms obtain their resources under unique
historical conditions and competitors without a similar
path cannot duplicate the valuable and rare resources.
Second, competitors may not fully understand the link
between the resources and competitive advantage since
there is causal ambiguity in the relationship between
these two. The reason behind a firm’s success and its
link with the resources may not be clear for outsiders
and competing firms may not know the ways they
should follow to imitate the strategies of firms with a
sustained competitive advantage. Third, there is social
complexity for resources which stands for complex
social relations, culture, and the existence of complex
interpersonal relations. Resources are complex
social phenomena which are not fully managed and
influenced and thus, they are difficult to imitate.
Non-Substitutability. For a sustained competitive
advantage, the last requirement is that there must
be no equivalent valuable resources (Barney, 1991).
Competitors might not be able to duplicate the
strategic resources of other firms exactly, but they
could follow the strategies of successful firms to
substitute a similar or a very different resource of
their own. Then, competing firms would follow
similar strategies with their alternate resources which
are also valuable, rare, and not imitable.
The resource-based view focuses primarily on
the internal analysis and resources of firms and
argues that resources and competencies which
are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and not
substitutable would generate a sustained competitive
advantage for the firms controlling these resources.
Along with these theoretical foundations, Grant
(1991) pointed out the need for an integrating
framework to develop the practical implications of
the theory and proposed a five-staged model for
a resource-based strategic analysis. According to
Grant (1991: 115), first, available resources should
be identified and classified in order to appraise
01 relative to competitors.
strengths and weaknesses
In addition, opportunities should be identified
for better utilization of resources. Second, the
model suggests that capabilities of the firms to use
resources effectively should be discussed (Grant,
1991). Third, the potential of resources to generate

87

4th International Tourism Congress

capabilities and sustainable competitive advantage
for organizations should be discussed. Fourth,
Grant (1991) suggests selecting a strategy that best
exploits the resources and capabilities relative to
external opportunities. Lastly, strategic analysis is
an ongoing process and resource gaps should always
be identified that need to be filled and invested
in replenishing, augmenting, and upgrading the
resource base (Grant, 1991). This model helps to
understand the process of resources contributing to
the competitiveness and also to generate practical
implications.
In strategy formulation, resources and capabilities
of firms are central considerations. The RBV explains
these internal resources and highly cited in strategic
management field of research. The view utilizes a
micro analytical approach and examines the internal
factors of firms but its theoretical explanations could
also be adopted to tourism destinations by developing
an evaluation of resources at the destination level.

Resource-based view to the
relationship among food, tourism
and destination
Destination attributes such as climate and scenery
have long been studied as sources of destination
competitiveness. Travel and tourism competitiveness
index developed by World Economic Forum contains
four broad categories; enabling environment,
travel and tourism policy and enabling conditions,
infrastructure, natural and cultural resources
(TTCI, 2017). As in this index, scholars (e.g. Dwyer
& Kim, 2003; Enright & Newton, 2004) have also
impressed on resources and available tourism
services for destination competitiveness. Resources
are considered as attractors in tourism industry and
competitiveness of a tourist destination depends on
attracting tourists (Dwyer & Kim, 2003: 369). It is
possible to make a long list of natural and cultural
resources that attract tourists but this study focused
on the cuisine of destinations.
Resources of gastronomy tourism, on the other
hand, require a holistic approach. Gastronomy
tourism covers a wide range of resources which
are broader than experiencing food as a physical
substance. Hjalager (2002) explains that value chain
in gastronomy tourism includes all the phases from
the basic ingredients to the point of eating, and to
food souvenirs taken back home. Smith and Xiao
(2008: 290-1) developed a framework for gastronomy
tourism resources and listed them in four broad
categories; facilities (buildings, structures, land uses,
routes), activities (consumption, tours, education/
observation), events (consumer shows, festivals) and
organizations (classification systems, associations).
This view suggests examining not only existing
resources in a destination but also improvements

88

and developments in gastronomy tourism products.
Crouch and Ritchie (1999: 143) claim that resources
provide only a relative advantage, but the real
competitive advantage for a destination could only
be achieved by development and efficient use of
the resources. As suggested by Grant (1991), RBV
should include the utilization process of resources.
Literature points out that gastronomy is a
valuable resource for tourist destinations. Enright and
Newton (2004) conducted a study to determine the
competitiveness in urban tourism in the Asia-Pacific
region and examined the factors that contribute to
the competitiveness of city destinations. Cuisine
was found one of the most important attractors in
this study which was second only to safety. When
the authors have further examined the Hong Kong’s
relative competitiveness in Asia-Pacific region, they
found that cuisine was the most important strength of
city. Results of another study (Kivela & Crotts, 2006)
with 1067 international tourists in Hong Kong showed
that the main reason for visiting the city was food for
approximately 21% of the respondents. In addition
to being valuable, gastronomy tourism products
could be rare resources if destination managers and
practitioners could benefit from these resources
efficiently. Their efforts and success in developing and
implementing strategies could serve as rare elements
contributing to the competitiveness (Alonso & Bressan,
2016: 363). Gastronomy of a destination is also very
difficult to be imitated by competitors since it reflects
the gastronomic identity of a region which is shaped
with unique historical conditions. Furthermore,
food-related experiences affect destination choice of
travellers (Björk & Kauppinen-Raisanen, 2016; Kivela
& Crotts, 2006) and, especially for gastronomy tourists,
they could not be substituted with other resources.
The study findings provide insightful explanations
for both supply side in tourist destinations and tourists’
demand for gastronomic products. Earlier studies also
allow us to develop a RBV of resources of gastronomy
which are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and
non-substitutable resources. Gastronomy, therefore,
regarded as an important resource for destination
marketing (Frochot, 2003: 78; Okumuş et al., 2013:
423) and gastronomy tourism is viewed as a market
niche (Horng & Tsai, 2012). Despite the increasing
awareness about the role of gastronomy, not many
cities are successful in using their food products
in destination marketing (Okumuş et al., 2007). In
this study, Gaziantep is examined as an important
gastronomy tourism city of Turkey. Gaziantep is
included in UNESCO Creative Cities Network with its
rich culinary heritage. Cities that could benefit from
creativity as a strategic factor for sustainable urban
development are included in the UNESCO’s list and
thus, it is important to examine the strategic processes
of the city and identify its key success factors.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This study employs case study research methods
and document analysis as the data collection
technique. Gaziantep is the case of this study which
is a city located in south-eastern Turkey. Gaziantep
is a “city of gastronomy” in UCCN with its rich
culinary heritage and therefore, the city presents
a relevant case to examine the culinary resources
and to develop a resource-based approach to
gastronomy tourism. In case studies, an analysis
of all relevant documents is recommended in
order to examine the case in detail and develop
an in-depth understanding (Gillham, 2003).
The reports, statistics, web pages of numerous
stakeholders and media news were examined for
this study (see the appendix 1 for a list of document
sources). In addition, the findings of academic
studies conducted in Gaziantep were taken into
consideration. In the analysis of the data, content
analysis was used. The model developed by Grant
(1991) was guided for a strategic analysis of the
gastronomic tourism resources of the city.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Gaziantep has important and valuable resources
for the development of gastronomy tourism. The
city stands out with its rich culinary heritage. The
region has unique product, food preparation and
consumption patterns. Of the 44 geographical
indications registered for Gaziantep, 40 of them are
food and beverages. Gaziantep, which is located in
Mesopotamia region, has been located at the meeting
point of cultures and has been influenced by different
cultures. However, in order for tourists to experience
this culinary culture, gastronomic tourism products
must be available for their visits and consumption in
the city. Thus, the first step of strategic analysis should
be the identification and classification of gastronomy
tourism resources (Grant, 1991). The sources
identified for Gaziantep as a result of document
analysis were classified by adopting the typology
developed by Smith and Xiao (2008).
Identification and classification of gastronomy
tourism resources
Facilities. Building/structures, land uses and
routes are facilities for gastronomy tourism (Smith &
Xiao, 2008). The main facilities available for visitors to
Gaziantep are restaurants. Local food and beverages
are served in a number of restaurants in the city centre
in a unique atmosphere and at a high quality service.
23 of the restaurants are certificated by Ministry of
Culture and Tourism. In total, there are around 1500
food and beverage enterprises in the city (SGK, 2018).
In addition to restaurant, cafes and coffeehouses, there
are museums where visitors can get information about
local cuisine or city’s agricultural products. Emine
Göğüş Culinary Museum displays the kitchenware

used in Gaziantep cuisine and representations of local
dishes. In the Pistachio Museum, the processes carried
out from the harvest to the consumption are explained
and information is given about the pistachios. It is also
possible to visit the historical coppersmith bazaar and
see the process of making kitchen utensils and purchase
them. Local products such as pistachios and menengiç
(turpentine) coffee could be found and purchased in
the local markets around the city. A large number of
food products are sold in these markets.
Gaziantep is one of the main destinations
for gastronomy or gourmet tours. Examination
of gastronomy tour routes of the travel agencies
showed that Gaziantep is the most frequently
included city in these tours. The routes of package
tours might include close cities such as Mardin and
Şanlıurfa which also have rich culinary culture. In
addition, cultural tours organized in the region have
gastronomic tourism activities in their programmes.
Kizilirmak et al. (2016) examined the gastronomic
routes in Turkey and reached similar findings. The
study identified 46 routes in the country and found
that the majority of these routes were organized
in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-eastern
Anatolia regions, and Gaziantep was included in
almost all of the tours organized in these regions.
Furthermore, it is possible to observe an urban
food district among the restaurants and markets
that are frequently visited in the city. Gastronomy
writers and bloggers also point to these districts.
In addition, some of the travel agencies’ programs
include activities such as visiting pistachio farms
and participating in harvesting. However, land uses
such as visiting farms are not frequent as restaurant
and market visits. The findings show that the city
do not benefit enough from its farms and vineyards.
Activities. Consumption,
touring,
and
education/observation could be considered as
activities in the scope of gastronomy tourism (Smith
& Xiao, 2008). Dining at restaurants and purchasing
food products such as baklava and pistachio are the
common activities of visitors to Gaziantep. Touring
urban districts where visitors could find those
products and have their meals or drinks is also an
important activity at the city centre. The activities
mentioned here are included in the package tours
of travel agencies. They are also easily accessible
at the city centre for independent travellers.
For gastronomy tourists who are interested in
receiving education or observing culinary culture
of Gaziantep, there are some opportunities. City
municipality has published a number of books to
01
promote the culinary culture of the city. Examples
of these books are Siveydiz-Gaziantep Cuisine, Four
Seasons of Gaziantep Cuisine, and Gaziantep Dishes
from Tradition to Future.
In addition to these activities, a small number
of customized food tours include visiting pistachio

89

4th International Tourism Congress

farms and food processing facilities. Participants find a chance to harvest some pistachio in these tours.
They also learn about preparation of dishes by observing and also participating during their visits to food
processing facilities or restaurants.
Events. According to Smith and Xiao (2008), consumer shows and festivals are important resources
for gastronomy tourism. Review of documents shows that Gaziantep hosts a number of events every year.
Consumer shows such as Natural Life Market have been organized in the city. The second International
Gaziantep Gastronomy Festival (Gastroantep) was held this year. Panels, workshops, seminars and
consumer shows were in the programme of the festival. Various activities are organized throughout the
festival which attract tourists, residents, children, gastronomy students and professionals. In addition, the
Shira Festival, which is a product made from grapes, and the Gaziantep Pistachio Culture and Art Festival,
which starts at the harvest time of pistachios, are organized annually.
Organizations. Associations and food and restaurant classification systems are subheadings of
organizations (Smith & Xiao, 2008). The most important association for the case of Gaziantep is UNESCO
Creative Cities Network. As explicated in earlier chapters, Gaziantep is affiliated as a creative city in the field
of gastronomy by UCCN in 2015. Being a gastronomy city provided a chance for the city to promote itself
as a gastronomy tourism destination. The city stakeholders have also applied to classification systems. They
mostly benefited from the food classifications provided by Turkish Patent and Trademark Office to identify
the geographical indications. The system of geographical indications is important to identify, protect, and
promote local foods of the city. Currently there are 40 food and beverages registered for Gaziantep.
Resources of Gaziantep for gastronomy tourism are discussed in four headings (facilities, activities, events,
organizations) as suggested by Smith and Xiao (2008). A list of these resources is also presented in Table 1.

Evaluating governmental principles for promoting gastronomy tourism
As mentioned above, Gaziantep has many resources of gastronomy tourism. Document analysis points out
the initiatives and efforts to develop gastronomy tourism in the city by using these resources. However, the
resource-based approach also includes steps such as assessing the competences of stakeholders to be able
to benefit from these resources, achieving competitive advantage and developing appropriate strategies for
this purpose (Grant, 1991). For Gaziantep, the main actor involved in the development and promotion of
gastronomy tourism is the local government. A review of documents points out the leader role of metropolitan
municipality for the projects, events, and other efforts to promote gastronomy tourism. Governmental
principles to develop and promote gastronomy tourism in Gaziantep could be evaluated as follows;

90

Developing
projects
for
sustainable
development. Mayor of the city explains that being
a gastronomy centre is not about only having a
range of local and unique products, but also about
generating employment, improving economy,
increasing export, and ensuring sustainable
development in the city. For that purpose, the
city stakeholders develop projects to effectively
use their own resources and local products. The
scope of these projects threefold; environmental,
economical, and social. For example, a pilotproject for preparing a territorial climate plan
was initiated in 2010, which was supported by
the French Development Agency and the French
Agency of Environment and Energy Management.
The Climate Action and Environmental Action
Plan has been implemented to develop a plan for
strategic sectors (transport, waste management,
water management, services, industry, housing)
and to proactively take action against climate
change. Projects for preserving the local
agricultural products of the city have been also
implemented. Gaziantep Pistachio Eco-Park
Project and Research and Development Centre for
Gaziantep Pistachio are two important examples
for these attempts. In addition, the city aims to
create employment opportunities for young
generation with Youth4food project. UCCN
explains the projects of Gaziantep as follows;
“The Municipality demonstrates a strong
commitment to improving urban quality of life
and supporting sustainable development through
many environmental and ecological programmes
including a climate change action plan, an
environment protection plan and the creation of an
eco-park. This third programme is aligned with the
production of renewable energy by transforming
pistachio shells, unused until now, into an innovative
source of energy foreseen to benefit both industrial
and residential use.”
Maintaining coordination between industry
stakeholders. The Municipality works together
with other stakeholders and also encourages
coordination among them. Organizations such as
Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Development
Agency, Chamber of Commerce work for
regional development and improving tourism in
Gaziantep. For example, a collaborative platform
was created to create cooperation among the
chambers of neighbour cities (Kahramanmaraş,
Kilis, Şanlıurfa, Adıyaman, Osmaniye, Antakya,
Gaziantep). Another cooperation is between
Regional Development Agency (İPEKYOLU)
and Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce is

Gastronomy and Culinary Arts Academy which
aims to organize professional culinary education
programmes for students and to organize seminars
and short term trainings for the food and beverage
industry members. Gaziantep Municipality,
Chamber of Commerce and Development
Agency are coordinating for improving the
quality of gastronomy tourism in Gaziantep.
Nongovernmental organizations, The Tourism
Support and Education Foundation (TUDEV) and
Mutfak Dostları Derneği (MDD), also support
this project. Furthermore, a partnership protocol
has been signed between the municipality and
Gaziantep University in 2015. These are only some
examples of coordination among stakeholders in
the city, but they are important to point out the
emphasis placed on coordination to produce joint
projects.
Implementing initiatives to achieve the
objectives of the UCCN. Cities acknowledge their
commitment to follow the objectives of UCCN by
joining the Network. These objectives could be
briefly listed as sharing best practices, developing
partnerships that promote creativity and the
cultural industries, strengthening participation
in cultural life and integrating culture in urban
development plans. Member cities must submit a
monitoring report in every four years to show their
implementations of the objectives. Gaziantep must
submit the report this year as being designated
four years earlier in 2015 but for Gaziantep,
it is possible to observe the implementations.
First, the city both hosts and participates the
events in member cities in an aim of establishing
cooperation and exchanging ideas with other
creative gastronomic cities. The city aims to
enhance technical and professional exchange
among professionals of restaurants and students
of schools of gastronomy. Member cities and also
other sister cities are invited to the International
Gastronomy Festival of Gaziantep (GastroAntep)
which has been organized annually and included
workshops and cooking shows of participating
cities. Gaziantep also actively participates in the
events of UCCN and Silk Road Mayor Forum.
Promoting policies and measures for sustainable
urban development is also one of the areas of
action set in the UCCN Mission Statement and
thus, the city’s projects
of sustainability mentioned
01
earlier support to objectives of UCCN. The efforts
of the city to improve participation in the projects
and events for marginalized or vulnerable groups
and individuals are also in compliance with UCCN
objectives.

Building the brand of gastronomy tourism
destination. The designation of the UCCN city
of gastronomy is extensively used by the city
in all of its gastronomy related events. It helps
to develop a brand for the city as a gastronomy
tourism destination. The geographical indications,
gastronomy events, gastronomy books are important
to indicate the local and unique products of the city.
In addition, the efforts to integrate culture and food
and to promote the culinary heritage by using the
background history for storytelling are important in
building the brand.
Constructing educational environment for
gastronomy and tourism. Providing educational
programs and training for students and
professionals is especially important for sustainable
development. It would also help to support to
UCCN objectives of enhancing creativity and
innovation. In an aim of encouraging a new
generation of culinary experts, Youth4Food project
is initiated in a collaboration between creative
Gaziantep, Bergen, Dénia, Östersund and Parma.
Youth4Food is the abbreviation for the ‘Youth in
action for a creative and sustainable gastronomy’
initiative which aims to increase the number of
students entering the industry and also tackle
the skills-shortage in the gastronomy sector. The
metropolitan municipality has also founded two
educational centres; Culinary Arts Centre and
Culinary Arts Training Centre. These centres
both provide training and also strive to revive the
traditional dishes and forgotten culinary rituals.
Thus, the centres also support to promote culinary
culture of the city.

CONCLUSION
This study examines the process of developing
gastronomy tourism in Gaziantep. From the
resource-based view, tourist destinations must
identify and effectively use their core resources for
gastronomy tourism (Horng & Tsai, 2012). Thus, the
resources of Gaziantep are identified and classified
in the first step of strategic analysis. Facilities,
activities, events, and organizations are examined
for developing a typology of gastronomy tourism
resources of the city. Second, government ability
and policies for promoting gastronomy tourism are
evaluated. Governmental principles are examined
in five headings; developing projects for sustainable
development, maintaining coordination between
industry stakeholders, implementing initiatives
to achieve the objectives of the UCCN, building
the brand of gastronomy tourism destination,

92

and constructing educational environment for
gastronomy and tourism.
Gastronomy has become a major attraction
of tourism destinations and it has considerable
potential as a means of developing and marketing
tourism regions (Richards, 2002). For tourist
destinations, however, owning the culinary culture
as a resource is not enough for achieving the
competitive advantage. There is also a need for the
operationalization that will provide the resources
for tourists. According to the resource-based
approach, a long term competitive advantage
could only be achieved if governmental principals
support the development and promotion
of gastronomy tourism and there are other
institutional actors available for the supply of
services. In this study, Gaziantep food culture is
determined as a competitive resource (rareness,
value, imperfect imitability, non-substitutability).
Findings also showed the heterogeneity within
the core resources of the city, including facilities,
activities, events and organizations. Governmental
initiatives to make the best use of these resources,
to increase the quality of tourist experiences,
and to create new experiences are the important
attempts for gastronomy tourism development in
the city (Hjalager, 2002).
This study identified the key success factors in
gastronomy tourism in Gaziantep from the RBV,
but there is also a need to discuss the positioning
of the city cuisine in the international tourism
market. The RBV discusses whether a resource
is competitive or not and makes an important
contribution to both theoretical and practical
strategic analysis. This discussion of resources
provides an initial basis for the evaluation of
competitive advantage, but fails to explain how to
position these valuable resources in a competitive
market. For this reason, this study can be considered
as the first stage of strategic analysis long-term
tourism region planning and a preliminary
research by showing that Gaziantep culinary
culture possesses the qualifications required to
have a competitive position in the global tourism
market. To further develop the strategic analysis,
how to position the gastronomy of the city and the
roles of government, private sector and regional
non-governmental organizations in this process
should be discussed by both practitioners and
scholars in future studies. In this way, it would be
possible to position the local cuisine of Gaziantep
among the world’s well-known cuisines.

ABSTRACT

T

his research is aimed to examine the relationship between tourism and employment through
econometric analysis. Literature shows that the relations between tourism and employment are
generally conceptually discussed. In this research, the relationship between the two concepts
has been empirically examined by means of econometric analysis. The number of people employed
in hospitality enterprises was used as an indicator of employment and tourism revenue was used as a
tourism indicator. Data was collected monthly between 2014 and 2018. Cointegration and causality
analyzes were applied to the data set. As a result of the study, long-term cointegration relationship
between tourism and employment was determined. After the determination of the cointegration
relationship, the causality test was applied to the series. According to the causality analysis, tourism and
employment were seen as Granger causes of each other. In this respect, suggestions were given to the
decision makers.
Keywords: Tourism, Employment, Cointegration, Causality, Turkey.

INTRODUCTION
Since the 1980s, the tourism sector has become a sector of great importance throughout the world. Therefore,
countries cannot remain indifferent to tourism mobilities due to their direct and indirect contribution to
the national economies. Tourism has micro impacts in the regional level as well as macro impacts that affect
the entire country. One of these macro economic effects is the employment-generator effect (Ünlüönen,
Tayfun and Kılıçlar, 2011; Bahar and Kozak, 2014). Employment means the utilization of something on a
duty (TDK, 2018). In terms of economic literature, it means the use of labor factor in its narrow sense and in
broad terms, the use of all factors of production (labor, capital, natural resources and entrepreneurs) during
production activities (Eren, 2015).
Although the employment-generator effects of tourism in the theoretical sense are known, the fact that
this situation has not been examined by econometric analyses constitutes the starting point of the research.
The main purpose of the research is to determine the direction of the cause and effect relationship between
tourism and employment and to propose solutions to decision makers. In this context, it is thought that
the analysis of the relationship between these two concepts through econometric analyzes constitutes the
original value of the research.

LITERATURE REVIEW

01

There is a positive relationship between income and employment due to the labor-intensive nature of
the hotel industry (Ghosh, Siddique and Gabbay, 2003). There are studies in the literature examining the
relationship between tourism and employment in Turkey (Çimat and Bahar, 2003; Dilber, 2007; Yıldız,
2010; Zengin, 2010; Ünlüönen and Şahin, 2011; Tutar, Alpaslan, Tutar and Erkan, 2013). Çimat and Bahar’s
research (2003) has examined the place and significance of tourism in Turkey’s economy through secondary

95

4th International Tourism Congress

data. In this context, indicators such as the number of tourists visiting Turkey, tourism revenue, expenditure
per tourist, and the contribution of tourism to national income were interpreted. It was foreseen from the
results of the study, that implementation of environmentally sound, sustainable and competitive policies
could cause Turkey to receive greater benefits from tourism and this would create better employment
opportunities.. Besides, it is thought that unemployment can be reduced with the employment-creating
effect of tourism (Çimat and Bahar, 2003).
Dilber (2007) examined the effects of the tourism sector to Turkey’s economy through input-output
table. In addition, the added value created by tourism was determined and future policies were proposed. In
this context, input-output tables have been created and interpreted utilizing World Tourism Organization
and Turkish Statistical Institute’s reports. As a result of the research, it was determined that 1 unit increase
in the tourism sector created 1.03 added value. In addition, the direct contribution of the tourism sector in
total employment in Turkey was determined to be 5.1% and indirect contribution was determined as 12.8%.
The study argues that tourism is crucial sector for Turkey especially for solving the unemployment problem
(Dilber, 2007).
In the study conducted by Yıldız (2010), the tourism sector’s historical development and its power of
creating new employment opportunities were conceptually discussed. Within the scope of the research,
the effects of the industrial sector and tourism sector on the solution of the unemployment problem were
examined comparatively. The study has reached to the conclusion that tourism sector is more effective
on reducing the unemployment in Turkey compared to the other sectors (Yıldız, 2010). In another study
conducted by Zengin (2010), economic contributions of tourism in Turkey between the years 1980-2009
were studied through secondary data. In the scope of the research, the effects of tourism on employment
were also examined. Accordingly, it is underlined that tourism, which is a sector where automation and
mechanization is difficult, has significant contributions to employment. According to the results of the
research, it was determined that the direct contribution of tourism to employment was 52% in 1993 and 79%
in 2008. Additionally, considering that the indirect effect of tourism to employment is 1,5 times more than
its direct effect, it was determined that tourism is of crucial importance for Turkey’s economy (Zengin, 2010).
Ünlüönen and Şahin (2011) discussed the importance of tourism in terms of employment. Secondary
data were used to examine the relationship between related concepts. As a result of the research, it is stated
that investments, which were considered the most effective job generator tools, have started to lose ground
and countries have started to look for other exits. Starting from this, it is emphasized that tourism, which is
a labor-intensive sector, is a serious option in employment generation.
In a study conducted by Tutar, Alpaslan and Erken (2013), the relationship between tourism sector
and employment was examined on a conceptual basis. In this context SWOT analysis was applied to the
relationship between the tourism sector and employment in Turkey. The results showed the strong aspects
of tourism as its foreign currency inflow and employment generation. However, the inability of tourism
activities to break from seasonality and the problems with education were determined as the weak aspects.
Turkey’s opportunities were found to be the government incentives and its young population; while the
threats were found to be that tourism culture in Turkey remains unsettled and that applied training isn’t
sufficient enough yet.

METHODOLOGY
In this study, the relationship between tourism and employment is examined by a three-stage time series
analysis. In the first stage, the stationary level of the variables was examined with the help of unit root
tests. In the second stage, the long-term relationships between the variables were analyzed with the help of
the cointegration test, developed by Engel and Granger (1987) and Johansen and Juselis (1990). After the
determination of long-term relationships, the causality relationship between variables was investigated in
the third stage.

Data and Model
In this study, the relationship between tourism revenues and the number of people working in
accommodation establishments between 2014 - 2018 was examined. Data were gathered on a monthly
basis from Turkish Statistical Institute. The primary reason for the research data to start from 2014 is that

96

Turkish Statistical Institute has started using household interview surveys for data gathering in 2014. The
relationships between the variables are modeled as below:
EMPt = β0 + β1TGt + ut

(1)

TRt = α0 + α1EMPt + εt

(2)

and

The EMP in Models (1) and (2) represent the number of people working accomodation businesses, while
TR represents tourism revenues. β0 and α0 represent the constant coefficients of the models. β1 is the slope
coefficient of Model (1), which is the effect of a 1 unit change in TR on the EMP. Likewise, α1 represents the
slope coefficient of Model (2), which is the effect of a 1 unit change in EMP on TR. ut and εt represent the
error terms of the models.

Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) Unit Root Test
One of the most important conditions in times series analyses is that the series which being worked on are
stationary. Analyses on non-stationary series create the problem of false regression. The primary reason
for the utilization of Agumented Dickey Fuller Test is its ability to analyze stationarity in a comprehensive
manner through three different equations. These equations are as follows: (Sevüktekin and Çınar, 2014):
t/POF
ͅYt = γYt - 1 + ut
t*OUFSDFQU
ͅYt = α0 + γYt - 1 + ut
t*OUFSDFQUBOEUSFOEͅYt = α0 + α1t + γYt - 1 + ut
The γ coefficient is the coefficient that is examined to be whether equal to zero or not during the
stationarity test. α0 and α1 represent the constant coefficient of the models and the trend coefficient
respectively. ut represents the error terms of the models. The hypotheses of the models are as follows:
H0 : γ ≥ 0 (Y does not stationary, Y has unit root)
H1 : γ< 0 (Y does stationary, Y has not unit root)
The τ test statistic was developed in order to test the above hypotheses in the ADF test. If the calculated
test statistic is greater than the critical values or the probability values are smaller than the significance
levels, (such as 1%, 5% or 10%), H0 is rejected. Otherwise, H0 cannot be rejected. In such a case, another
unit root test should be conducted on the difference between the variables. For instance, if the variable is
stationary on the p difference, it is I(p) for this variable, meaning the difference is stationary.

Cointegration Analysis
Cointegration analysis is a type of econometric analysis which examines the long term relationships
between time series. The first cointegration test was developed by Engle and Granger (1987). Engle and
Granger (1987) said that variables Y and X are not stationary at the level and if they are stationary at the
same degree, there will be a cointegration relationship between them. Engle and Granger (1987) test if
there is a cointegration relationship in the model by applying unit root test01
on the error term, which is
obtained by creating a regression with the original states of the variables. Later, a stronger cointegration test
was developed by Johansen & Juselius in the studies by Johansen (1988) Johansen & Juselius (1990) and
Johansen (1991). This test that they have developed is based on the Vector Autoregressive Models (VAR),
developed by Sims (1980). This test contains to base test statistics. The first of these is the trace statistic, and
the second is the maximum eigenvalue test statistic. The hypotheses of these tests are as below:

97

4th International Tourism Congress

H0: There is no cointegration relationship between the variables.
H1: There is a cointegration relationship between the variables
The criterion for deciding between the hypotheses is as follows: if the calculated test statistics are greater
than critical values, or the probability values are smaller than the significance levels, the H0 is rejected. In
such a case, it is decided that there is a cointegration relationship between the variablese.

Causality Analysis
In time series econometrics, if there are long-term relationships between the variables, causality relationships
are also expected between the variables.. The first causality test was developed by Granger (1969). The
primary function of the causality test is to determine the direction of the causality relationship between
the variables. It is considered as a continuation of the cointegration analysis (Tarı, 2014). Within the scope
of the study, the causality relationship between tourism and employment was examined through Granger
Causality Test.

ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
During the analysis phase of the study, in order to determine the causality relationships between tourism
and employment, Unit Root Test, Engle-Granger Cointegration Analysis, Johansen Cointegration Analysis
and Granger Causality Analysis tests were applied to the data set.

Unit Root Test Results
As mentioned in the methodology section, the stationarity of the time series were tested before getting
to the cointegration and causality analyses. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF), which is the most
preferred unit root test in the literatre, was utilized in analyzing the stationarity. (Sevüktekin and Çınar,
2014).

According to the unit root test results in Table 1, both the tourism and employment series are stationary
in the first degree. (p<0,0500).

Cointegration Analysis Findings
It was decided to apply the Engle-Granger and Johansen cointegration analyses in order to examine the
long term relationships between the series which were determined to be stationary at the level. An equality
was established in the scope of Engle-Granger cointegration analysis. Following this equality, the calculated
remainders (error terms) were subjected to stationarity test. According to the Engle-Granger approach
(1987), the remainders of the model being stationary at level is a sign of cointegration relationship.

According to the unit root test findings for the remainder series in Table 3, the tourism and employment
remainder series (error terms) are stationary at level (p<0,050). According to this, tourism and employment
act in a cointegrated way in the long term. Following the analysis, the data were subjected to Johansen
cointegration analysis for the validation of Engle-Granger cointegration analysis.
Before getting to Johansen cointegration analysis, the lag lengths of the series were determined. The
assessment based on Akaike (1974) and Schwarz (1978) information criterion has determined the series to
be at the second level of lag length.

According to the Johansen cointegration analysis findings in the Table 4, there is a significant long term
relationship between the tourism and employment series. (p<0,050). In other words, the Engle-Granger
cointegration analysis findings were supported with the Johansen cointegration analysis findings. A vector
autoregressive model (VECM) was established following the analysis and the causality relationships
between the series were examined.

Causality Analysis Findings
Following the cointegration analysis, the long term cointegration relationship between the tourism and
employment series was determined. Later on, the short and long term causality relationships were analyzed
by establishing a vector error correction model (VECM).

The long and short term Granger causality analysis findings in the context of vector autoregressive
model (VECM) are shown in Table 5. The long term causality was analyzed through t-statistics. According
to the t-statistics, which were found negative and significant, there is a reciprocal causality between tourism
(-2,9921) and employment (-5,1620). Short term causality relationship was examined through probability
values. According to the findigs, there is a reciprocal causality relationship between tourism and employment
in the short term (p<0,050). In conclusion, both tourism and employment were found to be the Granger
causes of each other.

CONCLUSION
This study aims to empirically prove the relationship between tourism and employment, which is accepted
on a theoretical level. The findings show parallelism with the existing literature. In other words, tourism
has effects on employment. (Çimat and Bahar, 2003; Ghosh, Siddique and Gabbay, 2003; Dilber, 2007;
Yıldız, 2010; Zengin, 2010; Ünlüönen and Şahin, 2011; Tutar, Alpaslan, Tutar and Erkan, 2013). However,
another finding of the research shows that employment also has a statistical effect on tourism. The study
has utilized the personnel statistics in tourism establishments published by Turkish Statistical Institute as
the employment indicator. Monthly tourism revenues between 2014-2018 in Turkey were utilized as the
indicator for tourism. According to the study results, the increase in the tourism revenues also increases
the number of personnel employed in the tourism sector. On the other hand, increases in the number of
personnel also leads to an increase in tourism revenues in Turkey. This means that there is a reciprocal
causality relationship between the two concepts.
Including different time frames or countries in the future studies is considered to benefit the literature.
In addition, this study takes the number of personnel employed directly in the tourism sector as the
indicator for employment. It is also thought that utilizing the personnel numbers indirectly employed in
tourism sector in future studies would contribute to the literature.

ABSTRACT

T

he aim of this study is to determine the role of local entrepreneurs in urban tourism. For this
purpose, the scope of the research consists of hotels owned by local entrepreneurs in Edirne, one
of the most important destinations of Turkey in terms of urban tourism and targeted to become
a Brand City by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The research data were obtained by
using the structured interview method with three different local tourism entrepreneurs (hotel owner) in
Edirne city centre. The findings of the research show that the local entrepreneurs are oriented towards
this sector because they find the potential of Edirne’s urban tourism strong, and they contribute to the
urban tourism and the economy of the city with their businesses. Although the years of establishment
and size of the hotel businesses interviewed in the scope of the research vary, the implications of local
entrepreneurs regarding the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Edirne in terms of
urban tourism overlap. Through the research, various suggestions were made for the development of
urban tourism in Edirne from the perspective of local entrepreneurs. However, it was concluded that
the support and cooperation of local governments were needed to implement these proposals.
Keywords: Urban Tourism, Local Entrepreneur, Hotel, Accommodation Sector, Edirne

INTRODUCTION
Urban areas are considered to be an important destination with different tourist attractions and
opportunities, and they are different from sea or rural tourism destinations with their energetic, versatile
and intense atmosphere offered to tourists (Uca, 2019, p.47). The factors such as cultural heritage elements,
gastronomic elements, recreation areas, festivals and other special events held in the city and a variety of
shopping opportunities that allow visitors to experience different types of tourism have a positive impact on
the touristic power of an urban destination. The facilities and services offered by hotels, restaurants, coffee
shops, pubs, nightclubs, etc., in an urban destination also play an important role in attractiveness of the city
and urban tourism economy.
Cities are always visited by tourists and tourism is perceived as having the potential to alleviate
unprecedented crises experienced by many urban areas (Nunkoo and Ramkissoon, 2010, p.37). Urban
tourism is a powerful force and has significantly influenced the ways cities think about their role and future
direction. (Spirou, 2011, p.xvii). In the development of tourism in a city, it can be said that local business
people have duties such as contributing to the creation of tourism demands through the strengthening of
tourism resources and services.
Currently, urban entrepreneurship prepares a suitable ground for citizens to combat against
unemployment and its problems (Hazehjan, Pirannejad, Zarandi and Amiri, 2016, p.82). Economists and
policymakers often argue that urban success depends upon a city’s level of entrepreneurship (Glaeser, Kerr
and Kerr, 2012, p.1). Audretsch, Belitski and Desai (2015) found that the economic development impact
of new-firm start-ups is positive for large, medium and small-size cities. According to Munoz and Cohen
(2016)’s study, urban entrepreneurship focuses on building healthy urban environments and improving the
well-being of local citizens through new businesses.
It can be mentioned that entrepreneurship is widely accepted as a crucial element of economic
development in urban areas and it is also important to analyze this notion in terms of tourism perspective.
In this context, this research aims to determine the role of local entrepreneurs in urban tourism and their
contribution to the economy of the city.

102

Local entrepreneurs can provide many different
services related to tourism in a city such as hotels,
restaurants and cafes. However, in this research,
the hotel sector which has the most economic
contribution with the multiplier effect created
within the tourism industry has been chosen in
order to reveal a clear picture of the contribution
of local entrepreneurs to the urban tourism. In
this direction, hotel businesses belonging to local
entrepreneurs in Edirne city centre were identified
and face-to-face interviews were conducted with
these business owners. The findings of the research
include information about the contributions of local
entrepreneurs to the urban tourism of Edirne, the
problems they face in the field of tourism and their
future targets. The results of the research show the
support of the central and local governments as well
as the contribution of innovative, determined and
risk-taking entrepreneurs to the desired goals in the
development of urban tourism.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Tourism in Edirne
Edirne was founded by the Thracians who
migrated from Central Asia in ancient times and
settled there. Alexander the Great later added these
to the vast borders of the Macedonian Empire.
Later, these lands, dominated by the Romans, fell to
Eastern Byzantium in 395 when the Roman Empire
was divided into two. The city was conquered by
Sultan Murat I in 1361 and became the throne city of
the Ottoman Empire until Istanbul was conquered.
During these years, it has experienced the most
glorious days in its history (Municipality of Edirne,
2019). Edirne, which had been the capital of the
Ottoman Empire for 92 years, is one of the few cities
in Turkey with its cultural and historical richness.
One of the most important touristic elements of
Edirne is the Selimiye Mosque. In addition to the
Selimiye Mosque, which was included in the World
Cultural Heritage List in 2011, there is one of the
largest synagogues in Europe in Kaleiçi, especially
where Jewish citizens lived intensively. Also, Edirne
has many holy places of different faiths such as the
Bulgarian Church (Sv.Georgi), the Sveti KonstantinElena Church, the Italian Church and the Baha’i
House. Activities such as Kırkpınar Oil Wrestling,
which has been held for 658 years, have aroused
interest for both local and foreign visitors. Historical
Kırkpınar Oil Wrestling, which is a deep-rooted
cultural tradition, was accepted by UNESCO as the
Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010

and included in the international list (Küçükaltan
and Çavuşgil, 2011, p.3). Similarly, the Kakava
Hıdırellez Festivities, which is a tradition of nearly
1,400 years, entered the UNESCO List of Intangible
Cultural Heritage of Humanity on December 2017.
Another important tourist spot is the Edirne
Palace. Only the Justice Pavilion, Cihannüma
Pavilion, Turkish Bath, kitchen and entrance door
remains of the palace, which was burned down
during the Russian occupation, survived to the
present day. There are many historical bridges in
Edirne where Meriç, Arda and Tunca rivers meet and
adorn the historical identity of the city. Historical
Bedesten, Semiz Alipaşa and Arasta covered bazaars
are the centers of commercial life today as well as
the history of Edirne. Edirne houses, which stand
out with their original residential architecture, are
the elements of cultural wealth with their woodstone craftsmanship and ornaments. The Complex
of Sultan Bayezid II Health Museum, which is one
of the most important health, social, cultural and
religious buildings of the period and is organized in
a thematic style, is the center of attention of many
visitors. In 2004 the museum was awarded the
European Museum Prize by the Council of Europe.
On the other hand; Edirne Cheese, Fried Liver,
Edirne Meatball and Marzipan are the local products
that are popular with domestic and foreign tourists.
Mirror broom, fruit soap, cloth doll and Edirnekari
are among the intangible cultural heritage elements
of the city (Küçükaltan and Çavuşgil, 2011).
Tourism, by creating employment and income,
is an important part of the local economy in
Edirne like in many cities of the world. There are
17 accommodation facilities with tourism business
certificate and 14 accommodation facilities
with local government certificate in Edirne city
centre. In 2018, a total of 53,176 foreign, 124,075
domestic and 177,251 tourists stayed in total in
accommodation businesses with a tourism business
certificate, and 40,257 foreign, 98,949 domestic
and 139,296 tourists accommodated in a local
government certificated hotels (TUROB, 2019).
On the other hand, Edirne connecting Turkey to
Europe with its five border gates is much more
important than many border cities in terms of
tourism. 1,813, 866 foreign visitors entered Turkey
from Edirne border gates in 2019 January-June
period. With these visitors, Edirne is the third01 in number of foreign
highest province in Turkey
visitors (Ministry of Culture and Tourism, 2019).
In addition, various researches on Edirne showed
that many domestic and foreign visitors travel to
Edirne as a daily visitor without accommodation
due to proximity to Istanbul and borders to
European countries (Boyacıoğlu, 2018; Özer, Köse
103

4th International Tourism Congress

and Küçükaltan, 2014). In this context, it can be
mentioned that the economic added value created
by Edirne in terms of urban tourism, is much
higher than the numbers in the accommodation
statistics.

Local Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs are highly influenced by the
characteristics of local economies, but they also
determine the future of these economies in general
(Glaeser, Rosenthal and Strange, 2010, p.1). It
can be stated that local people’s participation in
entrepreneurship activities is important in order to
provide regional development in a destination and
create new employment opportunities. In addition,
entrepreneurship and innovation are considered as
basic elements for the success of tourism and the
continuity of tourism development in global and
regional terms (Samiei and Akhoondzadeh, 2013,
p.1427). At this point, it is necessary to focus on
the notion of local entrepreneur, which enables
the more efficient use of local resources. A local
entrepreneur is defined as an individual who was
born and raised in a local area and carries the roles
of entrepreneurship (Adam, 2004, p.94).
Entrepreneurship activities of local people
are directly related to the support of destination
managers and tourism shareholders on tourism
enterprises (Şengül, 2017, p.128). In fact, as a
result of global economic restructuring and the
decrease in traditional production activities, many
city administrators in developed countries apply
tourism as a strategy for economic renewal and local
economic development (Rogerson, 2004, p.249).
The profits obtained from rural tourism activities
remain in the region by creating local entrepreneurs.
It can also be mentioned that the investments made by
non-local entrepreneurs are more likely to withdraw
from the market and therefore threaten the regional
economy. Researches also showed that immigration
reversed in rural tourism destinations where local
tourism entrepreneurs were successful. Local
entrepreneurs were also found to be more interested
in protecting cultural life and environment in the
region (Çakır and Ergüven, 2018, p.162). From this
point of view, it is crucial to create and support local
entrepreneurship.

METHODOLOGY
The study aims to examine the role of local
entrepreneurs in the development of urban tourism.
In this respect, the study is in descriptive research
type. First of all, literature was reviewed and

104

related notions were defined. Then, the results of
the research were revealed in which face-to-face
interviews were conducted by using the structured
interview method with the local entrepreneurs who
own hotels in Edirne.
The hotels to be interviewed were selected from
the accommodation facilities with tourism business
certificate in Edirne city centre. There are 17 hotels
in Edirne city centre. Owners of two hotels could not
be interviewed due to renovation in these enterprises
during the research. In August 2019, all other hotels
within the scope of the study were visited, and 3 out
of 5 local entrepreneurs who are from Edirne and
accepted the interview were interviewed. Sample
of the research consists of one five-star, one threestar and one two-star hotel in Edirne which are
important in terms of urban tourism. The five-star
hotel was defined as business A, three-star hotel as B
and two-star hotel as C in the research.
Twelve questions were asked personally by the
researches to local entrepreneurs. Questions about the
duration of presence in the sector, the target market
and methods of promoting the hotel were included in
the interviews in order to determine the experiences
of local entrepreneurs in the tourism sector. For the
purpose of the research; questions on the reasons of
investing tourism sector in Edirne, the difficulties
faced as local entrepreneurs in the tourism sector,
the steps to be taken for the development of urban
tourism, the hotel’s contributions to urban tourism,
future plans in the tourism sector and the strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Edirne in
terms of tourism, were directed to local entrepreneurs.

FINDINGS
The data obtained from the research participants were
examined and the common ideas of the participants
and shared thoughts are summarized below:
Reason for Investing Tourism Sector: The
reasons why all three local entrepreneurs chose the
tourism sector stem from their views that Edirne
has a significant potential for urban tourism. In
general, entrepreneurs think that tourism sector is
more advantageous than other sectors.
“Tourism sector with high potential and
innovation, and its certain existence in the future”
Hotel A
Difficulties Faced by Local Entrepreneurs in
Entering the Tourism Sector: Local entrepreneurs
faced different kinds of difficulties in starting the
sector. The most important reason for this situation
is that they stepped into the tourism sector in
different years.

“Strict bureaucracy instead of providing
convenience to investors during the construction
and licensing process” Hotel B
Difficulties Faced by Local Entrepreneurs in the
Tourism Sector: It was seen that local entrepreneurs
touch on similar elements in terms of problems and
difficulties experienced in the tourism sector. In this
context, local entrepreneurs agree that they have
difficulty in finding qualified personnel and that the
occupancy of the hotels reach a sufficient level only
when there is an event in Edirne.
“The graduates of tourism and hotel management
departments not speaking Greek and Bulgarian.
Lack of graduates’ knowledge in English, which is a
sine qua non of the sector.” Hotel B
Actions to be taken for the Development of
Urban Tourism in Edirne: Local entrepreneurs
generally present similar ideas within the scope of
what needs to be done for the development of urban
tourism in Edirne. Accordingly, local entrepreneurs
say that more attention should be paid to the
promotion and branding of Edirne and its cultural
values. It is emphasized that the lack of airline
transportation to the city should be done either
by constructing an airport or by increasing the
connection with Çorlu airport which is the closest
airport to the city. Also, local entrepreneurs see an
important tourism potential in the Meriç, Arda and
Tunca rivers and their surroundings.
“Organizing activities that will keep the tourists
in Edirne and make them stay for a long time…
Improving the riverside and making use of the rivers
in terms of tourism…” Hotel C
Cooperation
with
Local
Government
Institutions for the Development of Urban Tourism
in Edirne: The majority of local entrepreneurs
emphasize that the institutions of local government
are inadequate in developing urban tourism in
Edirne.
“…local government institutions are considered
inadequate” Hotel B
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and
Threats of Edirne from a Local Entrepreneur’s
Perspective in terms of Tourism: Local entrepreneurs
are united in terms of their strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities and threats in terms of Edirne’s urban
tourism. According to this, entrepreneurs state that
the biggest strength of Edirne is being the gateway to
Europe. The natural and historical beauties, cultural
and gastronomic elements of Edirne are also its
strengths while the city’s tourism infrastructure
and superstructure deficiencies are mentioned as
weaknesses. Greek and Bulgarian visitors to the city
are considered as the most important opportunity by

the entrepreneurs, and because Edirne’s proximity
to Istanbul, visitors leaving Edirne without
accommodate is the most important threat.
“Rich natural and historical beauties, cultural
and gastronomic tourism values, border gates”
Hotel B
“Tourists living in neighbouring countries
meeting their needs in Edirne” Hotel A
“Proximity to Istanbul, tourists often visiting
the most known places and going back their homes,
short-term accommodation” Hotel C
The Hotel’s Contributions to the Development
of Urban Tourism in Edirne: Local entrepreneurs
rank their contributions to urban tourism as a
contribution to bed capacity, promotion of the city
and contribution to employment (especially fivestar hotel).
Future Plans in the Tourism Sector: All three
entrepreneurs do not plan to invest in tourism in the
near future.
Target Market of the Hotel and Plans to Expand
the Target Market and Steps to be taken: Research
findings show that the target audience of all three
businesses is the same and businesses desire to
expand this target audience.
“Tourists who live in neighbouring countries
and guests from all over Turkey” Hotel A
“Mostly tourists from all over Turkey” Hotel C
Methods of Promoting the Hotel: Local
entrepreneurs mostly use the internet and social
media in hotel promotion.
“Promotions and e-advertisement on social
media” Hotel A

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
Today, considering the contribution of
tourism to revitalizing the economy of a city, it
increases the interest of public, private and public/
private sector cooperation in urban tourism.
Similarly, this economic attraction created by
tourism attracts the interest of entrepreneurs in
this field. However, it was seen that the concepts
of entrepreneurship and local entrepreneurship
were handled in the context of rural tourism.
The tourism-related entrepreneurship activities
01 tourism are important
of local people in urban
in the development of urban tourism and the
growth of the city’s economy. In this context,
local entrepreneurs are expected to contribute to
the creation of tourism demand by strengthening
tourism resources and services.

4th International Tourism Congress

In the development of a tourism destination, it is important to have entrepreneurs investing in that region.
The fact that these entrepreneurs are locals of the region can help them to master both the opportunities
offered by that region and the problems of the region. Local entrepreneurship also has economic advantages.
The fact that the profits from the region remain in that region may also lead to an increase in the welfare
level in general. In the tourism literature, it is seen that local entrepreneurs are heavily associated with rural
tourism activities (Bosworth & Farrell, 2011; Komppula, 2014; Paniagua, 2002).
In this research, the concept of urban tourism, which has an important place in the economic
development of cities, is discussed from the perspective of local entrepreneurs. Study results show that the
accommodation sector cannot adequately assess the resources and attractiveness of Edirne’s urban tourism.
It was seen that the hotel businesses in the city reach the desired level only when there is an event in Edirne
and Edirne is visited by daily tours due to its location. In this context, the basic desire of hotel businesses is
to convert the daily flow of national and international visitors into tourists.
Local entrepreneurs offer various suggestions for the realization of this request. First of these suggestions
start with deficient of Edirne city center’s touristic infrastructure. Such as the need for more reliable and
low-cost parking service, free toilet service at major tourist spots and taking measures against hygiene and
pricing problems that will hinder tourism. They advise to all cafes and restaurants in the city to have menus
in Greek, Bulgarian or English. They stressed the importance of creating alternative tourism activities such
as water sports on rivers or different sports and entertainment activities. These activities will keep the tourists
in Edirne and make them stay for a long time.
In sum, the findings of the research show that, besides the marketing activities carried out by the hotel
businesses for the urban tourists, the administrative institutions in Edirne should plan the services and
activities that may attract the interest of the visitors. In future studies, more local tourism entrepreneurs in
Edirne can be interviewed. Also, other local entrepreneurs in the tourism sector such as restaurant and café
owners can be included in the research in order to see the whole frame. Besides that, similar interviews can
be made in different cities in Turkey.

ABSTRACT

V

isiting archeological sites and expecting unique experiences at these sites are the main motivation
for cultural tourists. Thus, the study aims to determine the role of archeological sites in cultural
tourism competitiveness. To reveal the role of the archeological sites on the competitivenes of
cultural tourism of Turkey, factor conditions which is one of the four attributes of Porter’s Diamond
Model (others are demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and firm strategy, structure
and rivalry) was investigated. The interview technique is used to collect data. The interviews were
conducted face-to-face and electronically with 14 tourism academics who have expertise in heritage
tourism and archeological sites. The data were subjected to content analysis through a qualitative data
analysis program. The analysis indicate that factor conditions consist of 16 codes. The findings revealed
that the participants had negative perceptions for the followings: the preservation and restoration
of the artifacts in the historical sites, adequacy of souvenirs, ancilliary services, cultural activities,
organizing events, personnel, infrastructure and budget transfers. On the other hand, the participating
academicians gave positive opinions about information services in historical and archeological places.
Keywords: Archeological Sites, Competitiveness, Diamond Model, Factor Conditions, Cultural Tourism

INTRODUCTION
With the globalization, the borders between countries have disappeared and this situation has caused the
competitive environment among firms to become more severe than before. In this competitive environment,
sectors have turned to different strategies in order to gain competitive advantage. Porter (1990) asserts that
nations succeed in certain industries due to their innovative, dynamic and challenging home environment.
Further, he provides convincing arguments on how some nations gain competitive advantage over other
nations: ``national prosperity is created, not inherited``( Porter, 1990:73). The four expansive attributes of a
nation compose the diamond of national advantage. These are factor conditions, demand conditions, firm
strategy, structure and rivalry, and related and supporting industries. Various sectors can increase their
competitiveness by considering the dimensions in the diamond model.
In the tourism sector, it is necessary to provide competitive advantage in order for the destinations to
generate more income than their competitors. In other words, nations should protect the existing resources of
destinations, train qualified personnel, diversify tourism products and perform demand analysis (Aydemir,
Saylan & Aydoğmuş, 2014). To achieve these goals, destinations should analyze Porter’s attributes within
the framework of the diamond model. The historical and cultural assets of the countries are among the
important tourist attractions; culture is one of the main sources of motivation that drives tourists to travel
and affects tourists’ choice of destination. In this respect, cultural assets enable the destinations to compete
against other destinations.

108

Turkey is home to numerous cultural assets because it hosted many civilizations since ancient times.
Therefore, it is a country with high potential for cultural tourism. According to the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism (2018), there are 108,813 registered tangible cultural properties in Turkey. The ruins of these
tangible cultural properties are visited by many local and foreign tourists.
The investigation of the competitiveness analysis of the historical and archeological sites in Turkey
within the framework of factor conditions will provide guidance to industry managers and government
officials to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the country’s cultural tourism and to increase the
cultural tourist numbers and boost tourism income. This study aims to determine the roles of historical
and archeological sites on the competitiveness of cultural tourism in Turkey. To this end, the results of the
study will guide researchers and tourism sector practitioners in terms of determining the strategies for the
competitiveness of cultural tourism.

LITERATURE REVIEW
According to Porter (1990)’s diamond model, there are four main factors that will enable a sector or firms
to gain international competitive advantage. These factors are factor conditions, demand conditions, firm
strategy, structure and rivalry and related and supporting industries. These key elements are interrelated and
have an impact on profitability levels as they determine the competitiveness of the industries (Has, 2013).
In addition to these factors, chance factor and government support affect the competitive advantage. Each
factor on the diamond—and the diamond as a system—influence critical elements for competitiveness.
Diamond model is aimed to guide companies to gain success in the international competitive environment
(Porter, 1990).
Factor conditions include human resources, infrastructure, natural resources, information resources
and capital (Öz, 2019). In order to gain competitive advantage, sectors should first analyze their factor
conditions in detail and focus on production and services according to the factor conditions in which they
are strong. For example, if a firm employs more people with low levels of education, it must focus more
on labor-intensive products and services in order to compete with other firms in the international arena.
Conversely, if people with a high level of education are employed in a company, products and services
appropriate to their educational level should be produced (Koç and Özbozkurt, 2014). In other words, since
qualified personnel are employed in a company with a high level of education, more quality and technology
oriented products can be produced and this company can compete with other companies that employ high
level of education in the international arena.
Factor conditions for tourism industries include such features as the natural and historical attractiveness
of destinations, infrastructure, human resources and capital. Turkey has 18 cultural property inscribed on
the UNESCO World Heritage List as of 2018 (UNESCO, 2019). These are given below with the approval
year in parenthesis.

METHODOLOGY
Qualitative research method was used in this study which was conducted to determine the role of historical
and archeological sites in cultural tourism competitiveness. Qualitative research provides a thorough indepth exploration of the subjects to be investigated (Yıldırım & Şimşek, 2013). In qualitative research, the
number of subjects investigated is small and purposeful sampling method is used to explore the events and
characteristics in detail (Miles and Huberman, 1994). In the present study, purposive sampling method was
applied.
Faculty members who work in tourist guide and tourism management departments of various universities
in Turkey were determined in the scope of purposeful sampling scope. The faculty members include in the
sample due to the professional experience and knowledge that they have about the archaeological sites and
cultural tourism. The interviews have beeen conducted with the faculty members working in the tourist
guidance and tourism management departments and the data collection process was terminated when the
information saturation was reached.
During the data collection period, 14 academicians were interviewed. The interviews were conducted
by face-to-face with 3 faculty members in their own offices in June 2019 and by electronic mail with 11
faculty members. The use of electronic mail as well as face-to-face interviews in data collection is due to the
time constraints. During the face-to-face interviews, reading the questions directly from the interview form
was avoided and eye contact was created to ensure the trust of the participants. Face-to-face interviews were
conducted for periods ranging from 30 to 45 minutes. Before the start of these interviews, the participants
were asked for permission to use a voice recorder and as a result of the consent of the participants, the
interviews were recorded with the audio recorder. The questions sent by e-mails included with explanatory
cover letter and the resonses to the questions were asked to be returned by e-mail within the period
determined by the researchers.
For the interviews, a form consisting of structured questions was prepared before the interview in
order to prevent the researchers from directing the participants according to their own beliefs and thoughts
(Seyidoğlu, 2009). The questions cover the factor conditions in the Diamond Model, more specifically
assess the role of the archeological sites on the competitivenes of cultural tourism of Turkey. The questions
were prepared by the researchers based on the literatüre review (du Cros and McKercher, 2015; Edwards,
2013; Griffin et al., 2013)
The four main questions and sub questions structured by the researchers are as follows:
1. Would you evaluate the historical and archeological sites in Turkey for improving cultural tourism
competitiveness on the following subjects and issues?
a. The attractiveness and value of historical and cultural monuments, restoration works;
b. Status of information services; c) Giftware; d) Additional or ancilliary services; e) Cultural activities
and services in historical sites; f) Environmental arrangements and cleanliness of the ruins, lighting
levels, the presence of appropriate arrangements for the elderly and disabled.
2. Please evaluate the quality and quantity of human resources (administrators, archaeologists, office
and cleaning staff) for the competitiveness of cultural tourism in Turkey.
3. What are the conditions of infrastructures of historical and archeological sites in Turkey?
4. Do you think sufficient budget is allocated for the maintenance, protection and promotion of cultural
monuments and ruins in Turkey?

ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
The data obtained from the interviews were first transferred to computer and converted to text format.
Then the data converted to text format was subjected to content analysis. Nvivo 11 qualitative data analysis
program was preferred to create codes and themes. Therefore, the interview responses were translated into
Nvivo 11 program. Content analysis was conducted by two independent researchers. As a result of the

110

analyzes performed, the codes formed by the researchers were compared and discussed until an agreement
were reached. In the analysis, the participant names (# 1, # 2, # 3…), as well as location, archeological and
historical site (XX) names are concealed. As a result of the content analysis, 16 subcodes were created
within the scope of factor conditions theme (see table 1). The source field in Table 1 indicates the number of
participants with the code, and the reference field indicates the frequency with which the code is repeated.

Half of the participating academics (n=7) emphasize about the high value of the archeological sites and
monuments. For example, one participant (# 10) shares the following words for the value of the artifacts in
the ruins. ‘’The attractiveness of historical and cultural areas in our country is indisputable. Depending on
the history of each region, it is possible to see and experience the monuments and marks of many cultures.”
However, a very negative perspective (n=8) prevails rather than the positive point of view (n=3) on the
conservation and restoration of these works.
The opinion of a participant (# 12) with a negative view on the preservation of the sites comes to the fore:
“Although these historical and archeological sites are very valuable, I believe that they are not adequately utilized.
I think that these very valuable sites are not protected in any way (not even enough). Some of our most valuable
sites are exposed to vandalist behavior, and even restoration or preservation efforts to keep them sometimes
make them worse. I think that people in our country are not conscious about the protection of these landmarks.
Somestimes increasing the security and preservation efforts may damage the historic sites. As we cannot protect
the cultural landmarks, the works we do on behalf of protection are done without knowledge and unconscious.
The critical perspective underlines that both tourists and administrations are responsible for the
preservation of the sites. Negative expressions were also detected in the restoration studies. For example,
participant # 14 told that ``the wrong practices in the restoration, failure to hand over the restoration work to
the expert causes damages that cannot be corrected in terms of art history, thus seriously damaging the image
of the country.”

On the other hand, information services, signs and postings in historical sites are considered as positive
(n=10). Academicians who expressed a positive opinion about the information services refer it for the most
visited sites and ruins. There are some deficiencies in information services in relatively less visited places.
These shortcomings include “lack of direction and sign language” (participant # 1), “inadequate guidence”
(participant # 10), “lack of printed information, brochures and maps (participant # 11, # 12, # 8), “insufficient
information on the use of mobile guidelines” (# 12), “neglected information plates” (participant # 14). The
111

4th International Tourism Congress

majority of the participants (10) talk about qualitative and quantitative deficiencies for souvenirs sold for
tourists in historical sites. The most frequently mentioned inadequacy is that the majority of the souvenirs
offered are not local and they are not varied.
Another code that emerges under the theme of factor conditions is the perception of additional services.
Under this code, it is noteworthy that negative views (n=10) are predominant and the repetition frequency
of these views are high (n=17). Additional negative services include hygiene conditions in the toilets,
parking problems, inadequate resting facilities, and the lack or absence of meeting points. Perception of
cultural activities is also mostly negative (n=8). One of the participants (# 6) said for such cultural activities
are not organized in the archeological sites. Sometimes they are organized on very special occasions, maybe
a few times a year. Even these cultural events that are arranged to are not professionaly laid out.
Under the perceptions for arrangement-cleaning-lighting code, negative opinions (n=10) were found to
be higher. In parallel with the additional services code, the lack of hygiene in the toilets was repeated under
this code. Other deficiencies indicated by the participants in this code are inadequate arrangements for the
elderly and disabled, insufficient and neglected roads and hiking trails in the ruins, and lack of sufficient
lighting.
Finally, shorteges of human resources both in numbers and qualities (n=11), infrastructure deficiencies
(n=11) and insufficient budget allocations (n=9) are expressed by the participants. The negative comments
made by the participants about the staff in the historical sites include the lack of tourism education and
foreign language problems, the small number of responsible archaeologists or experts, and the insufficiency
of the number of employees at some historical sites. In terms of infrastructural deficiencies, technological
deficiencies and transportation problems in some historical sites come to the forefront. The majority of the
participants (n=9) think that there is not enough budget allocation to solve all the problems mentioned
in this theme. To overcome these problems, two participants (# 12 and # 13) suggested that earnings
from museum and sites entrance should spend for the maintenance and protection of thesesites. One
participant (# 6) emphasize the sponsorship and financial support from the private sector and NGOs fort
he sustainability of the historical and archeological sites.

CONCLUSION
In this study, the factor conditions of historical and archeological sites, which are an important factor in
determining the competitiveness of cultural tourism, are examined. Within the scope of the research,
the evaluations of expert academicians on the value, preservation and restoration of the artifacts in the
ruins, the quality and quantity adequacy of the souveniers offered for sale, information services, additional
services, cultural activities, regulations, personnel, infrastructure and budget allocation were examined.
Overall, the present study evaluated the historical sites in Turkey, and the respondents are dominated
by negative perceptions. The majority of the participating academics state that there are deficiencies in the
protection of the historical sites. Despite the high values of the artifacts exhibited in the ruins, they are not
protected enough and successful restoration studies are not to be realized. Similarly, it is stated by the expert
participants that the souvenirs presented in the ruins are insufficient in terms of quality and quantity. In
particular, the lack of authenticity and diversity of souvenirs are among the criticisms made. Participants also
state that additional services are insufficient. Among the problems frequently mentioned by the participants
are the lack of hygiene in the toilets, lack of parking facilities, and inadequate recreational facilities such as
cafeterias or benches. Another negative problem is that the roads and paths inside the archeological sites
and ruins are insufficient and untidy. This situation is especially dangerous for elderly and disabled visitors.
In addition, expert participants stated that technological infrastructure is inadequate in many historical
sites; lack of access to the internet or very slow loadings demotivate cultural tourists to spend time there.
Again, in some historical sites, it was found that the number of qualified staff was insufficient; the staff
generally did not receive tourism education and did not speak a foreign language. Participant thoughts on
cultural activities in historical sites are also mostly negative. Budget deficiencies are seen as an important
factor in the presence of problems expressed by experts. In order to overcome the budget deficiencies, it is
stated that some of the additional income from the activities and the revenues from the entrance should be
used for the maintenance, restoration, repair and marketing of the sites.
Turkey has substantial resources for attracting cultural tourists, who travel specifically to attain a deeper
understanding of the cultural values or heritage of a destination (du Cros and McKercher, 2015:3). As

ABSTRACT

T

he property of the inseparability and simultaneous production / consumption of the services
provided in hotel enterprises intensify the interaction between the employees and customers.
Therefore the front-line employees become the primary actors for meeting the customers’ demand and expectancies. In today’ competitive conditions the thoughts, experiences and expectations of
employees as well as customers should be taken into consideration. An approach that cares about the
employee will be effective in creating a service oriented approach in the enterprise as well as providing
better service.
The service orientation, which is based on customer and employee satisfaction, varies depending on
the front-line employees as well as various organizational variables. The purpose of this research is to
determine the service oriented status of the employees in the hotels based on the demographic characteristics. The research was carried out in five hotels selected from five different star statuses in Ankara.
Data were collected by “face-to-face survey” method. The service oriented (SERV*OR) measure was
used in the questionnaires. A total of 49 front-line employees have participated to the survey. In the
analysis of the data, Mann Whitney U and Kruskall Wallis H tests were utilized. As a result it is seen
that the gender, status and the working time were effective on the service orientation of the front-line
employees; however, the age and graduation status were not effective.
Keywords: Hotel Enterprises, Front-Line Employees, Demographic Characteristics, Service Orientation.

INTRODUCTION
In the management discipline which began to develop with the production oriented management approach
after the Industrial Revolution, a shift towards a service oriented approach has taken place due to the increased competition, the changes taking place in the global market and the increase of the importance of
the human resources (Vargo and Lusch, 2004, p. 2). Service orientation is an approach that uses various
resources, competencies, knowledge and skills to meet customer needs by interacting directly with the customer (Grönroos, 2000, p. 48; Lusch and Vargo, 2006, p. 283).
According to the service oriented approach in hotel enterprises, which have an important place in the
service sector, the service’s inseparability and simultaneous production/consumption feature result in the
continuous interaction of service employees, customers and the enterprise. Together with this interaction,
“value” is put forward by using the resources and competencies of each participant together. (Grönroos,
1982, p. 33-34; Susskind, Borchgrevink, Kacmar and Brymer, 2000, p. 54-55).
Front-line employees in hotel enterprises are the most important service actors who are constantly
in face-to-face communication and interaction with customers. As such, skilled employees have become
the most important competitive element for enterprises today, placing them at the core of being service
oriented (Doğan and Demiral, 2008, p. 146). In addition to the knowledge, skills, and experience, the
personality, appearance, attitude and the behavior of the employees make the service concrete and help the
positive enterprise image (Bitner, Booms and Tetreault, 1990, p. 71-72; Hartline and Jones, 1996, p. 208209). When viewed, the profile or demographics of employees are an important variable in service oriented

and service prone. There are numerous literature
findings showing that demographic characteristics
of employees such as age, status, experience are
important in loyalty to the enterprise and loyalty
to the customer (Cohen, 1993; Allen and Meyer
1993; Balay, 2000; Çakır, 2001; İnce and Gül, 2005;
Toker, 2007; Karahan, 2008) However, few research
findings that directly link the service orientation
with front-line employees profile have established a
basis for the idea of conducting this research. The aim
of the study is to determine the service orientation
status of front-line employees in hotel enterprises
according to their demographic characteristics. For
this purpose, the data obtained from the front-line
employees of five hotels of different star status in
Ankara were compiled using the survey technique.

LITERATURE
In the early times of industrialization, employees
seen as a cost element in enterprises have become
the most valuable resource, along with globalization, the prominence of service enterprises, and the
efforts of enterprises to increase production (Asunakutlu, 2001, p. 1; Doğan and Demiral, 2008, p.
146; Akoğlan Kozak, 2016, p. 3). The intense interaction experienced by the hotel enterprises as a result
of the labor intensity and the creation of the value of
the service together with the customer (co-creation)
(Vargo and Lusch, 2004, p. 1-2) affects the customers’
general perceptions about the service (Grönroos,
1990, 2000; Lovelock and Wirtz, 2007) and makes it
important for the employees to be service oriented.
Service orientation is a strategic approach in
which the enterprise focuses on its core ability and
resources to deliver more value to the customer
compared to its competitors. Service focus is
defined as service event, application and procedure
(Bowen and Ford, 2004, p. 395) in an enterprise
environment that rewards behaviors exhibited
in order to provide quality service, create a better
experience for customers, maintain that experience,
and perform them. Service orientation positively
influences overall operating performance (Lytle,
Hom and Mokwa, 1998; Kuşluvan and Eren, 2008),
financial operating performance (Lynn, Lytle and
Bobek, 2000), customer satisfaction and loyalty
(Johnson, 1996; Garg and Chan, 1997), employee
satisfaction (Saura, Contrí, Taulet and Velázquez,
2005; Gonzales and Garazo, 2006), organizational
citizenship behavior (Gonzales and Garazo, 2006),
organizational commitment and service image (Lee,
Park and Yoo, 1999).

One of the variables affecting employees’ service
orientation is leadership (Heskett et al., 1994; Saura
et al., 2005; Gonzales and Garazo, 2006; Kuşluvan
and Eren, 2008; Gebauer, 2009). In addition, the
design of the service system and its functions
by using new technology also affects the service
orientation of the employees (Johnson, 1996; Lytle
et al., 1998; Homburg, Hoyer and Fassnacht, 2002;
Antioco, Moengert, Lindgreen and Wetzels, 2008;
Yavaş and Babakus, 2010).
In providing service orientation in hotel
enterprises where labor is used extensively,
especially the Human Resources (HR) department
plays an active role. In studies it has been shown that
there is a positive correlation between the functions
of HR department such as business regulation,
recruitment, employee performance evaluation,
employee training, management functions and the
service orientation (Lowe and Vodanovich, 1995;
Harris and Fleming, 2005; Skarlicki and Latham,
1996).
As well as variables such as leadership, HR
management, service design and technology,
the critical and integral component necessary
to implement and maintain service orientation
within the enterprise are employees. Therefore, the
demographic characteristics or the qualification of
the employees are the important dimensions that
should be addressed in line with the purpose of the
research (Yalçın and İplik, 2005; Çolakoğlu, Ayyıldız
and Cengiz, 2009; Yen, Yeh and Lin, 2016).
Researches in the literature suggest a positive
or negative correlation between the demographic
characteristics of employees and their job satisfaction,
commitment to the business, and service orientation
levels. For example, studies have shown that older
employees have a greater commitment to business
and a greater orientation on service (Cohen, 1993;
Balay, 2000). This is because young employees have
a higher desire to work in a job that suits their
training level and individual characteristics, and
they have more expectations than the business can
provide. This leads to a decrease in loyalty to the
business. In addition, older employees tend to be
more satisfied with their profession and status in the
business (Ketchand and Strawser, 1998; Çakır, 2001;
İnce and Gül, 2005).
Increasing status in parallel with age and
experience is an important factor that increases
01
employee satisfaction and service orientation. (Allen
and Meyer 1993; Toker, 2007; Karahan, 2008). The
most important reason for this is that employees
who remain in the same business for many years
and whose status increases have many rights such
as retirement and annual leave (Mathieu and Zajac,

115

4th International Tourism Congress

1990; Hamarneh, 1998). In the tourism sector, where
employee turnover rate is high, employees who are
in the same business for a long time can be said to be
more service oriented.
The results of the research by gender factor
differ. For example, Serçeoğlu and Selçuk (2016)
found that female employees are more service
oriented than male employees in accommodation
establishments in the TRA1 region. However, there
are also researches that reveal a negative directional
relationship between gender and service orientation
factors (Grusky, 1996; Haller and Rosenmayer, 1971;
Mathieu and Zajac, 1990).
Employees with a high level of education
accommodate less to their positions because
they can find jobs more easily. Therefore, their
commitment to business and service orientation is
said to be lower (Modway, Steers and Porter, 1979;
Abdullah and Shaw, 1999).
In the literature it is seen that the demographics
of employees affect their commitment to the
business and their service orientation. Therefore,
the demographics of front-line employees who
interact face-to-face with customers in hotel
enterprises are also important variables affecting
service orientation.

METHOD
The field of study of this research is Ankara, which is carried out in order to determine the service
orientation status of front-line employees in hotel
enterprises according to their demographic characteristics. The fact that Ankara is a city with different
hotel categories, that hotels provide service all year
round, that hotels are a city hotel, that they have a
certain occupancy rate (60%), that employees are
more likely to be working in the same hotel for a
long time and that they are easily accessible to the
researcher has been decisive in this election. In the
study, it was deemed appropriate to select a sample
from each of the hotels of different status in Ankara (between one-star and five-star). It has also been
noted that hotel businesses have been operating for
at least five years.
The research data was collected by face-toface survey technique. The people to whom the
survey was conducted are the front-line employees
of the hotels participating in the survey according
to the service configuration of the hotel. The
service orientation (SERV*OR) scale used as a
questionnaire is a scale for measuring employee
perception regarding the level of service orientation
of the employees and the enterprise. This scale,
consisting of 35 items expressions in total, was

116

developed by Lytle et al. (1998). However, this
scale was shortened by Robinson and Williamson
(2014) for easier implementation by managers and
researchers, and applied to front-line employees
of service enterprises in the United States with the
Likert type 5 attitude scale (1=strongly disagree and
5=strongly agree), and the reliability of this short
scale increased to over 0.90. The short form of the
SERV*OR scale has been preferred for reasons such
as avoiding too many questions, ensuring that the
answering rate is high, saving cost and time, and the
reliability of the abbreviated scale is also high. The
short form of the scale consists of four factors and
16 items.
The first factor, “leadership” of the SERV*OR
scale has four items, the second factor, “customer
satisfaction” has six items, the third factor, “service
system and technology” has three items and the final
factor, “HR Management and employee training”
has three items. The scale was first translated
into Turkish by a three-person translation group,
including the researcher. Subsequently, the scale has
been transformed into a form in which experts can
interpret and express their views in terms of scope
validity
The expert opinion form prepared has been
presented to 14 experts, including seven academics
and seven sector experts. In determining the groups
as experts, attention was paid to the knowledge of
English as well as its dominance in the field, and
the scale was presented in English and Turkish
form and the opinion was asked. Expert opinions
were obtained via e-mail. Experts rated the scale
as “necessary,” “necessary but inadequate” and
“unnecessary.”
With the aim of evaluating the obtained expert
opinions, the content validity ratio (CVR) which was
developed by Lawshe in 1975 and which requires
for at least 5 and up to 40 expert opinions was
utilized. For the ease of calculation, at the “α=0.05”
level of significance minimum values of CVR were
converted to table by Veneziano and Hooper (1997)
(Yurdagül, 2005).

Since the number of experts referenced is 14, the value of CVR must be 0.51 or higher for each item in
order for items to be valid according to Table 1. The two remaining items below this value are subtracted
from the scale. In the final case of the scale, there are 14 items and 6 demographics; age, gender, duration
of work, mode of work, graduation status and status. In order to determine the relationship between these
characteristics and service orientation, the following hypotheses have been established1:
H1: The service orientation in hotel enterprises differs according to the gender of the employees.
H2: The service orientation in hotel enterprises differs according to the age groups of the employees.
H3: The service orientation in hotel enterprises businesses differs according to the duration of the
working of the employees.
H: The service orientation in hotel enterprises differs according to the status of the employees.
H5: The service orientation in hotel enterprises differs according to the graduation status of the employees.
Since the number of employees was 49, nonparametric tests were used to test hypotheses. The “Mann
Whitney U test” tested whether service orientation differs according to the gender and age groups of
employees; and the “Kruskal Wallis H test” was used whether it differs according to working times, status,
and graduation status.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, the findings are given under two headings. Under the first heading, the physical characteristics of the hotel enterprises and the demographics of the employees of the front-line which were included in
the research were given; under the next heading, the findings of the hypothesis tests were included.

Demographic Findings
All of the hotels surveyed are located in central Ankara. The managers of the hotels said that the customers
are made up of customers who stay constantly, who often travel for work, and who prefer the hotel for its
location. One-and two-star hotels have stated that customers care about low accommodation prices, while
three-, four-, and five-star hotels care about continuous accommodation customers’ business treats and/or
company price agreements. According to the size of the five hotels in the survey, the services offered are
shown in Table 2.

In order to carry out the surveys, date and time planning was made by appointment of hotel managers.
Surveys were applied face-to-face to front-line employees within a permitted of one week duration. A total
of 49 employees who took part in front-lines during the research period in the five hotel businesses in which
the research was carried out were all involved in the research. Distribution of employees of hotels in Table 3.

The demographics of the front-line employees who participated in the study are included in Table 4.
Out of a total of 49 employees, 23 were female and 26 were male. The lack of much difference between
the number of women and the number of men suggests that the gender profile of employees is evenly
distributed. The majority of employees are between the ages of 31-40 (71.4%), the age range (18-30) were
represented by 28.6%, while there are no front-line employees aged (41-50) and between the ages of 51 and
older. This indicates that employees are concentrated in the young and adult group. 42.9% of the employees
were educated at undergraduate level. This is followed by associate graduates at a rate of 32.7%. High
school (12.2%) and graduate (10.2%) graduation rates are close to each other and have a low representation
rate. The lowest rate was calculated at secondary school graduation (2%). Nearly all (98%) of front-line
employees are full-time employees. The term of office is 6 months to 1 year (32.7%) and 1 year to 3 years
(30.6%). Accordingly, the group of employees for up to three years constitutes the most concentrated slice
of experience. Given the fact that the working times of the employees in the same enterprise are short in the
tourism sector, it can be said that the employment times of the employees are relatively high. The fact that
the hotels are city hotels may have affected this situation.
While the proportion of those with employee status is highest (59.2%), intermediate managers are
represented by 26.5%, while those with manager status are represented by the least (14.3%). In fact, it is
important to show a hierarchical organizational structure and point to the most commonly encountered
form of management pyramid.

responded to all items. According to their response to the SERV*OR scale items directed at employees, their
participation in the items can be said to be high. The number of those who responded “strongly disagree”
and “disagree” to the statements appears to be minimal. Employees generally respond “agree” and “strongly
agree” to items regarding the attitude and behavior of the employees on the scale. For example, to the “item
1”, 57% of the employees responded, “I agree” and 26.5% responded, “I strongly agree.” Employees often
think that they are doing best to satisfy the customers. However, employees’ opinions about the enterprise
are concentrated in “neither agree nor disagree” (42.9%).

As shown in Table 6, the service orientation differs according to the gender of the employees (p*<0.05).
When the rank averages are taken into account, it is seen that men are more service oriented than women.
The H1 hypothesis has been accepted. This result is similar to studies in the literature. The results of the
studies on commitment to the enterprise and identification with the enterprise have been reached that
male employees have a higher organizational commitment than female employees (Güçlü, 2006; Güneş,
Bayraktaroğlu and Özen Kutanis, 2009; Şama and Kolamaz, 2011; Aydın, Sarıer and Uysal 2011; Altın
Gülova and Demirsoy, 2012).
There were no significant differences in age groups. Because the value p* is greater than ”,05” (,113>,05).
The H2 hypothesis has been rejected. This can be attributed to the fact that the employees have a close age
and that the employee in each age group has experience and training to take an approach that cares about
customer satisfaction.

As shown in Table 7, service focus differs according to employee’s working time and status (x2(4) = 9,799,
p* <0.05; x2 (2) = 12.8, p**<0.05). Looking at the rank averages, it is seen that employees which have 5 years
or over work time are the most service oriented. This is followed by employees with work times 3 to 5 years
and employees with work times 1-3 years respectively. It can be said that those who work between 6 months
and 1 year and those who work 6 months and less can be said to be less service oriented. Checking the rank
average of the status groups shows us that the managers are more service oriented, followed by the supervisors.
Hypotheses H3 and H4 have been accepted. Increased working time and thus increased status in the same
enterprise enables employees to exhibit more service oriented behavior and to have stronger ties with the
enterprise and the customers. Those who work for 3-5 years in the enterprise and who are in manager and
supervisor status are more service oriented and depend more on customers and the enterprise than those who
have less than 1 year of working time and those who are not in management status. These results are similar
to the results in the literature. Increased working time and status in the same enterprise increases employee
satisfaction, contributes to the professional achievements of employees and increases their commitment to the
enterprise (Allen and Meyer, 1993; Balay, 2000; Emir and Baytok, 2004; Toker, 2007; Karahan, 2008).

Whether the service orientation differs
according to the graduation status of the employees,
the p*** value is greater than “,05”and there is no
significant difference (x2)(4) = 11.712; ,2>0.05). In
this case the H5 hypothesis has been rejected. This
can be attributed to the close representation rate
of employee graduation degrees, as well as the fact
that the education status is from the field related
to tourism education or is supported by in-service
training in this field.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The service orientation of the employees in hotel
enterprises determines the customers’ perceptions
about the enterprise, and also affects service performance, service quality, customer satisfaction and
loyalty. Hotel businesses that treat employees’ service orientation as their core business strategy are
more efficient in service production, more competitive and more preferable. Today, it is known that the
demographics of the employees are the main factors
affecting the service orientation of the front-line
employees, whose role in hotel enterprises is more
prominent. In this context, it is aimed to determine
service oriented situations according to the demographics of the front-line employees who are constantly in face-to-face interaction with the customer
in hotel enterprises.
In line with the purpose of the research, a field
survey was conducted in Ankara and five hotel
enterprises of different star status (between one-star
and five-star) were included in the study. Hotels have
been selected among those that have been operating
relatively long. Considering the context of the tourism
sector, it is important that the front-line employees of
the hotels included in the study, should be at work in
the same business between 6 months and 3 years in
order to increase the quality of the findings.
In research findings it is seen that the
demographics of front-line employees affect their
service orientation status. According to research in
the field, the rise of status of the long-time employee
in the same enterprise, the increase in wages and
job satisfaction make them more service oriented
(Mathieu and Zajac, 1990; Allen and Meyer 1993;
Hamarneh, 1998; Toker, 2007; Karahan, 2008). Of
the front-line employees involved in this study, those
with a longer working period and higher status were
also found to be more connected to the business and
customers and more service oriented.
The fact that male employees are more service
oriented than women when compared to the gender

element is another striking result in the research
findings. There are also studies that conclude that
women are more service oriented than men (e.g.
Serçeoğlu and Selçuk, 2016), indicating a negative
relationship between the two elements (Haller
and Rosenmayer, 1971; Mathieu and Zajac, 1990;
Grusky, 1996). In this research, it is thought that
female employees are unable to make the desired
effort to be service oriented due to some sectoral
constraints and behavior patterns such as distance
in customer relations. Also, men generally work
in better positions than women and at higher
pay are the most important reasons why they are
more committed to the enterprise and their jobs.
According to another view, because women are
based on their role in the family, the institution
they work for is secondary and they are generally
less connected to the enterprises than men (Aven,
Parker and McEnvoy, 1993; Hewlett and Luce,
2006). However, Kurşunoğlu, Bakay and Tanrıöğen
(2010, p. 110) suggested that the predominance of
the social roles of men in Turkish society, such as
home support and family leadership, led men to
feel more responsibility for their profession than
women. In this context, increasing the status of
women employees, ensuring their participation
in management and providing different training
in developing better customer relations can be
suggested in order to ensure that they are more
service oriented.
Research in the field suggests that older
employees are more satisfied with their profession
and status, more connected to the enterprises they
work in, and more service oriented (Cohen, 1993;
Ketchand and Strawser, 1998; Balay, 2000; Çakır,
2001; İnce and Gül, 2005). However, according to
the results of this research, there is no effect of the
age variable in terms of service orientation. The
most important reason for this is that the ages of the
employees involved in the research are close to each
other. This can also be attributed to the fact that
employees from all age groups have the experience
to take a service oriented approach
As a result, the service orientation of front-line
employees in hotel enterprises is influenced by the
organizational elements as well as the demographics.
Therefore, businesses should take into account the
demographics of employees and the results of these
features in ensuring service orientation, which
01 satisfaction. In addition,
is the basis of customer
employees with different demographics are required
to work according to their profiles, to provide equal
opportunities for each employee and to manage
differences in harmony are the facilitative steps that
should be taken into account in providing service
focus in hotels.

ABSTRACT

T

he robust development of tourism is not possible without the support of the local people.
On the other hand, the local people are the main stakeholders who are directly affected by
the development of tourism in a destination. Therefore, it is very important to determine the
perceptions and attitudes of the local people towards the effects of tourism for the sustainable and
successful development of tourism. The aim of this study was to compare the perceived effects of
tourism by local people and their perceptions of support in terms of tourism development according
to income and education levels. The questionnaire prepared for this purpose was applied to the local
people residing in Beypazarı district of Ankara between September 25 and October 1, 2018 selected by
the convenience sampling method. A total of 418 usable questionnaires were analyzed. In the study it
was determined that those with lower education and income levels had a higher perception about the
negative effects of tourism while their perceptions about the positive effects of tourism were lower.
Key Words: Local People, Effects of Tourism, Support to Tourism Development, Beypazarı.

INTRODUCTION
The perceptions of local people about the positive and negative effects of tourism is critical to the success of
the planning and management of a sustainable tourism development through support and participation in
tourism development (Gursoy, Jurowski and Uysal, 2002). Although the ways in which the host community
members perceive the effects of tourism differ, in general, a positive perception of the effects of tourism by
the local people increases their likelihood of supporting tourism development whereas a higher perception
of negative impacts makes them indifferent to such support (Perdue, Long and Allen, 1990; Andereck,
Valentine, Knopf and Vogt, 2005; Látková and Vogt, 2012, Nunkoo and So, 2015). Changes between
individual and community benefits and costs perceived by local people are often explained by the theory
of social change which suggests that if perceived benefits are greater than perceived costs, individuals will
support tourism development and participate in tourism activities (Ap, 1992; Látková and Vogt, 2012). In
other words, if local people perceive more cost than benefits from tourism development, they are likely
to oppose and generate conflict (Lankford, 1994; Chen and Chen, 2010). The change can be based on
economic and concrete resources such as goods and money, as well as intangible social ties such as mutual
trust and friendship (Lambe, Wittmann and Spekman, 2001). Therefore, change can be realized with both
economic and social resources (Nunkoo, 2016).
Most studies indicate that perceived costs adversely affect the support of local people for tourism
development (Jurowski, Uysal and Williams, 1997; Gursoy et al., 2002). In this respect, it is important to
balance the benefits and costs of tourism development (Ap, 1992; Andereck and Vogt, 2000; Dyer, Gursoy,
Sharma and Carter, 2007). Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the current perception of local people about
tourism development (Nunkoo, Gursoy and Ramkissoon, 2013). In this way,01
it may be easier for tourism
planners to strengthen positive elements and develop optimal strategies for the development of sustainable
tourism for the benefit of the local people (Sinclair-Maragh, Gursoy and Vieregge, 2015). Although the
effects of tourism development on local people, perceptions and attitudes of local people about tourism
development have been investigated by many researchers especially in developed countries and / or regions
(Perdue, et al., 1990; Carmichael, 2000; Ko and Stewart, 2002), it can be said that this issue is a relatively

125

new source of concern for developing countries and
/ or destinations (Long, 2012). The aim of this study
has been to examine the perceptions and attitudes of
local people living in Beypazarı district of Ankara,
which is a rural tourism destination within the
scope of some socio-demographic characteristics.

LITERATURE
Many studies have been carried out on the impact
of tourism in the last 30 years. Most of these studies
examined the impact of tourism development on
local people and their perception and attitudes
towards tourism development (Gursoy and
Rutherford, 2004; Dyer, et al., 2007; Nunkoo and
Ramkisson, 2011). The main reason for this interest
is the awareness that tourism development has
positive and negative impacts at the local level (Ko
and Stewart, 2002). As a result of the studies, there is
a common consensus in the literature that tourism
development in a region has mainly economic, sociocultural and environmental positive and negative
effects (Belisle and Hoy, 1980; Liu and Var, 1986;
Choi, 2003; Kuvan and Akan, 2005 Chen and Chen,
2010). Like many other industries, tourism is often
used as a national and / or regional development
tool (Jackson, 2008; Liu and Var, 1986), however
with proper planning, integration with local values
and the environment, socio-cultural, environmental
and economic benefits can be achieved for the local
community (Lee, Li and Kim, 2007; Long 2012).
Increased household incomes (Haralambopoulos
and Pizam, 1996; Jurowski et al., 1997), diversification
of shopping opportunities (Liu and Var, 1986; Choi,
2003), strengthening the local economy (Perdue et
al., 1990; Gursoy and Rutherford, 2004), creating
more jobs and employment (Belisle and Hoy, 1980;
Milman and Pizam, 1988) and improving the flow
of tax revenues (Andereck et al., 2005; Ko and
Stewart, 2002) can be listed among the positive
economic effects of tourism. The negative economic
effects of tourism include increased cost of living
(Liu and Var, 1986; Rasoolimanesh, Jaafar, Kock
and Ramayah, 2015), prices of products (Andereck
et al., 2005; Brunt and Courtney, 1999), increase in
home, land and property values and taxes (Tosun,
2002, Latkova and Vogt, 2012). In addition, the
growth of economic dependence on tourism
(Garg, 2002; Kozak, Kozak and Kozak, 2010), the
increase in seasonal employment and employment
of foreign workers (Kim, 2002; Kozak et al., 2010)
and injustices in income distribution (Garg, 2002;
Choi, 2003) are some of the negative economic
effects manifested as a result of traditional tourism
development in a destination. Tourism reveals

126

many social and cultural effects, both positive and
negative (Kim, 2002; Gursoy and Rutherford, 2004;
Dyer et al., 2007). Positive socio-cultural effects of
tourism development include the development of
an environment of tolerance and understanding in
destinations (Ap, 1992; Harrill, 2004), improving
the quality of life of local people (Gursoy et al., 2002;
Nunkoo and So, 2015), increasing the availability of
recreational facilities for host communities (Kim,
2002; Tovar and Lockwood, 2008), reduction
of gender discrimination (Dunn, 2007; Boley,
2013), specialization in occupations (Lanza and
Pigliaru, 1995; Cerina, 2007), strengthening the
social structure and identity (Besculides, Lee
and McCormick 2002; Boley, 2013), encouraging
the protection and revitalization of traditional
arts, cultures and works of art (Kim, 2002;
McGehee, Andereck and Vogt, 2002), enabling the
manifestation of a community pride in recognizing
their resources, products (Kim, 2002; Johnson, 2010)
and the transfer of these assets to future generations
(Onderwater, 2011; Aref, 2011). However, hostility
and resentment among local people due to the
striking differences in tourism gains and inequalities
in income distribution along with the development
of tourism in a region (Doxey, 1975; Kim, 2002), the
increase in unethical behavior due to the increase
in crime rates (Andereck et al., 2005; Nunkoo
and Ramkisson, 2011), corruption of traditional,
social and family values (Besculides et al., 2002;
Andereck et al., 2005), the occurrence of cultural
conflicts with tourists (Kim, 2002; Choi, 2003),
the increasing number of foreign language words
included in the mother tongue (Ap and Crompton,
1998; Kozak et al., 2010), the commercialization
of the culture of the host community and the
increasing number of imitation products paving the
way for the disappearance of traditional handicrafts
(Haralambopoulos and Pizam, 1996; Dyer et al.,
2007) are negative socio-cultural effects generated
by tourism development. Another factor that closely
concerns the perception and attitude of local people
about tourism is environmental impacts. Tourism
and the physical environment are inextricably
linked. Therefore, the attraction elements related
to the physical environment are highly effective on
tourism demand (Avcıkurt, 2009; Kozak et al., 2010).
While tourism development is seen as a mechanism
for improving natural and artificial areas and
reducing the demand for environmental pollution
and excessive use of resources (Dwyer, Edwards,
Mistilis, Roman and Scott, 2009) on one hand, on
the other hand, it is possible that tourism activities
may also negatively affect natural and physical
resources (Lankford, 1994; Andereck et al., 2005;
Sinclair-Maragh et al., 2015). Increasing crowds (Ko

and Stewart, 2002; Dyer et al., 2007), traffic (Kim,
2002; Dyer et al., 2007) and environmental pollution
caused by waste (Ko and Stewart, 2002; Nunkoo
and Ramkisson, 2011), air, water, soil and noise
pollution (Tosun, 2002; Latkova and Vogt, 2012),
parking problems (Sheldon and Abenoja, 2001; Ko
and Stewart, 2002) depletion of natural resources
(Ko and Stewart, 2002; Sinclair-Maragh et al. 2015)
and unplanned construction (Lee, Li and Kim, 2007;
Avcıkurt, 2009) are examples of the negative impacts
of tourism on the environment. In this context, Julio
(2001) describes tourism as ‘goose that not only lays a
golden egg, but also fouls its own nest”.
An examination of the literature reveals that
some of the studies focus on the attitudes of local
people towards tourism development (Stylidis,
Biran, Sit and Szivas, 2014), while other studies have
focused on the perception of socio-demographic
variables related to local people in terms of
tourism development (Kasarda and Janowitz,
1974; Gursoy and Rutherford, 2004; Harrill, 2004).
The data obtained from these studies show that
the perception, attitudes and behaviors generated
by tourism on local people are realized at various
levels and the results change when these concepts
are examined through different variables. Therefore,
it is not possible to speak of a universal consensus
on the effects of variables that affect the perception,
attitude and behavior of local people. In fact, some
study results indicate that socio-demographic
variables affect local people’s perception of tourism
development (Milman and Pizam, 1988; Nunkoo
and Ramkissoon, 2010; Almeida-García, PelaezFernandez, Balbuena-Vazquez and Cortes-Macias,
2016) while others indicate that these variables
do not display any causal effect (Jurowski, 1994;
Kuvan and Akan, 2005; Wang and Psifter 2008).
Socio-demographic variables can be listed as age
(Haralambopoulos and Pizam, 1996; McGehee
and Andereck, 2004), gender (Pizam and Milman,
1984; Kuvan and Akan, 2005), marital status
(Haralambopoulos and Pizam, 1996; Smith and
Krannich, 1998), having children (Milman and
Pizam, 1988; Haralambopoulos and Pizam, 1996),
education level (Teye, Sonmez and Sirakaya, 2002;
Kim, Park and Phandanouvong, 2014), income
(Haralambopoulos and Pizam, 1996; Kuvan and
Akan, 2005), economic dependency on tourism
(Pizam, 1978; Perdue et al., 1990), place of birth
(Pizam, 1978; Um and Crompton, 1987) and
residence time in the destination (Liu and Var,
1986; Lankford, 1994). Furthermore, there may be
some differences between rural and urban areas
regarding how tourism impacts are perceived
(Wall and Mathieson, 2005). In this respect, the
study aimed to examine the positive and negative

effects of tourism and the perception of support for
tourism development among the local people living
in Beypazarı district of Ankara according to their
monthly income and education level.

METHOD
The population of this study consists of local people
living in Beypazarı district center of Ankara. The data
were collected with face to face interviews between
September 25 and October 1, 2018. The convenience
sampling method was used for sampling which was
preferred in the study instead of using the whole
population. Since the population of Beypazarı is more
than 10,000, the n = S2Zα2/d2 formula proposed by
Özdamar (2001) for quantitative studies and infinite
populations was used to calculate the sampling size.
The standard deviation in the formula was S = 1,
considering similar studies using the questionnaire
and 5-point Likert scales while α = 0,05 significance
level was countered by Zα = 1,96 and effect width d
= 0,1 to calculate the minimum sample size to be at
least 385. In this context, 500 questionnaires were
distributed and 418 were evaluated by taking into
account incomplete, inaccurate and low reliability
questionnaires.
A questionnaire technique was used as data
collection tool in the study. The survey consisted
basically of two parts. The first part included 6
questions (gender, occupation, age, education level,
marital status, income status) in order to determine
the demographic characteristics of the individuals in
the sample group. The second part consisted of the
scales for the effects of tourism perceived by the local
people and the support for tourism development. The
scale of the effects of tourism perceived by the local
people was taken from the study of Segota, Mihalic
and Kuscer (2017). The Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient
of the scale was 0.77. The tourism support scale was
taken from the studies of Stylidis et al. (2014). The
Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of the scale was found
to be 0.92. The items in the scales were subjected to a
five point Likert rating and the level of participation
of the individuals in the sample group for each item
was rated as Strongly Disagree = 1, Disagree = 2,
Neither Agree or Disagree = 3, Agree = 4, Strongly
Agree = 5. SPSS 18.0for Windows program was used
for data analysis. For the construct validity of the
scales, explanatory factor analysis was applied and
01 of the reliability analysis
the internal consistency
was calculated by Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients. On
the other hand, the demographic characteristics of
the individuals have been presented with frequency
and percentage distributions while the positive and
negative effects of tourism and the perceptions of

127

4th International Tourism Congress

support for tourism development of individuals have been presented with percentage distributions as well
as arithmetic mean and standard deviation.

FINDINGS
The distribution of the participants according to their demographic characteristics is presented in Table 1.
Accordingly, 65.4% of the total 418 respondents were male, 78% were married, 65.3% were under the age of
40, 81.1% had high school or less education and 35.7% earned 3500 TL and less in income. However, 19.4%
were employers, 34.2% earned salaries and 46.4% had other occupations.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The success of the tourism industry depends on the local attractions and the hospitality of the local people
(Gursoy et al., 2002). In general, tourists are reluctant to visit places where they do not feel well (Belisle and
Hoy, 1980; Diedrich and García, 2009). Therefore, hostile behavior on the part of the local people towards
tourists may be an obstacle to the tourism sector while a sincere attitude can support tourism development.
(Yoon, Gursoy and Chen, 1999). The attitudes of the local people also affect a positive or negative effect on the
tourism development and sustainability of any destination (Sirakaya, Teye and Sonmez, 2002; Harrill, 2004).
An examination of the literature reveals that there are differences in the ways in which local people
perceive the effects of tourism and develop an attitude regarding this perception because each community
has its own structure and circumstances (Harrill 2004; Dyer, et al., 2007). Therefore, this study regarding
how perceptions and attitudes of local people living in Beypazarı differ according to income and education
variables is expected to contribute to literature. The findings indicate that the participants with low
education and low income levels had higher perceptions of the negative effects of tourism while their
perceptions about the positive effects of tourism were lower. Similarly, the perceptions of participants with
low education and income levels in support of tourism development were more negative. It is noted that
these findings obtained within the scope of the study coincide with the results of many studies in the
literature (Hernandez, Cohen, and García, 1996; Haralambopoulos and Pizam, 1996; Teye et al., 2002;
Almeida-García et al., 2016). In their study, Hernandez et al. (1996) stated that the local people who had
not completed secondary school had a less positive attitude towards tourism development than those with
a high education level. According to the authors, those who have a lower education level think that they
have less chance of finding employment and / or getting direct benefits from tourism than those who have
a higher education level. He also pointed out that local people with lower levels of education are more
conservative in protecting their lifestyles and are more likely to be more sensitive in this matter. In their
studies, Kuvan and Akan (2005) determined that the local people with a lower education level had a more
critical perspective regarding tourism development. Furthermore, Haralambopoulos and Pizam (1996) and
Kuvan and Akan (2005) found a significant association between higher income levels and positive attitudes
of local people towards tourism development. Accordingly, more affluent residents with more positive
attitudes supported tourism development more while low-income residents supported it less.
The findings of the study can be interpreted as the higher the education and income level of the people of
Beypazarı, the more positively the effects of tourism will be perceived and support for tourism development
will develop accordingly. In this context, some suggestions have been developed regarding the activities that
can be carried out with the local people in order to ensure successful tourism development in Beypazarı. As
a priority, local governments should take action in order for the local people, who earn their living mainly
from agriculture, animal husbandry and trade, to participate more in tourism activities and gain economic
benefits from tourism. In this context, it is considered to be useful to provide guidance on how to generate
income by providing various trainings and courses to the housewives who are currently producing tarhana,
homemade macaroni, handicrafts and jewelry products for the tourist demand as well as local people who do
not generate income from tourism. Courses can be initiated by the municipality by making the local people
aware that traditional culture such as filigree, coppersmithing, quilting, weaving, local home cooking are
a means of income from tourism. Thus, both the local people earn more income and the cultural heritage
is conserved and maintained. Within the scope of rural tourism, Beypazarı’s villages can be brought to
the forefront by creating different opportunities such as eco tourism, farm tourism, adventure tourism,
thermal tourism and the destination of tourists will not be limited to Beypazarı district center. A joint
cooperative can be established in which the production, sales and marketing of local products produced in
Beypazarı can be carried out. In this context, local administrations, development agencies, universities and
NGOs can join forces to provide local people with training on business, entrepreneurship, co-operative,
marketing and tourism, and visits to exemplary tourism destinations can be organized. The establishment
of foreign language courses at a basic level in the district with the cooperation of the Municipality, Ministry
of National Education and universities is likely to contribute to a more positive outlook of the local people
regarding tourism development.
The study involves a number of limitations in view of time, cost and application constraints. First of
all, the convenience sampling method was preferred for obtaining data. The study was carried out with
local people who live in Beypazarı district of Ankara and agreed to complete the questionnaire voluntarily.
Therefore, the study findings cannot be generalized to the local population. It is thought that it will be

130

possible to monitor and predict the support for
tourism development by repeating this study in the
future. Furthermore, it is considered that examining
the perception, attitude and support of different
stakeholders of tourism in future studies will
contribute to the literature.

ABSTRACT

I

n the 21st century, differences, individuality and identity notion has come to the forefront and it has
affected demand and supply in markets. Behind the restaurants which compete in the monopolistic
market should be perceived different from other enterprises. As a result of these development’s
concept restaurants which reflect a stated theme to customers with their menus, services and interiors
has emerged in recent years. Concept restaurants create both a new service style and identity in the
sector. Although service quality, customer satisfaction and preference factors of restaurants are
frequently investigated in the literature, it is seen that the studies on concept restaurants are extremely
limited. On the other hand, a study examining concept restaurants among restaurant type, has not
been found in the literature. The aim of the research is defining the concept restaurants, examining the
examples in the world and classifying concept restaurants in terms of themes among restaurant type. In
this context, in the research, restaurant literature and application examples in the world were examined
and it is seen that concept restaurants can be classified in its kind and among restaurant type.

INTRODUCTION
Changing environmental conditions has affected the demand and supply in the marketing sector continuously.
Businesses that want to be active in their sectors must keep pace with this change. Considering that the
most important requirement it is clear that today’s restaurants should take into account both the demands
and trends focused on experience (Hotelling, 1990). On the other hand, the fact that restaurants compete in
the monopolistic market where there are similar businesses in terms of food and beverage, service quality
and price, constitutes the necessity to be perceived differ from other enterprises. In this context restaurants
want to locate in a different place for customers have to constitute an identity (Bell, Meiselman, Pierson
and Reeve, 1994). In the 21st century, where the effects of postmodernism are so high, the individuality,
differences and identity come to the forefront and restaurants serve experiences to customers through their
own identity (Featherstone, 2007). Food, beverage, service and interior design are the basic elements of the
identity for the restaurants. Restaurants which have many similar competitors in terms of food, beverage,
service quality and price must create a different with service style and interior design for the identity. In
addition, many researches showed that restaurants should pay attention to interior design and service for
shaping customer perception (Namkung and Jang, 2008). For all these reasons, concept restaurants have
emerged in recent years, and they have created a new service style while reflecting a specific theme with their
food, beverage, services and interior design. Although service quality, customer satisfaction and preference
factors of restaurants are frequently investigated in the literature (Wall and Berry, 2007; Heung, Wong and
Qu, 2000; Mattila, 2001), it is seen that the studies on concept restaurants are extremely limited. On the
other hand, a study examining concept restaurants among restaurant type, is not found in the literature. The
aim of the research is defining the concept restaurants, examining the examples in the world and classifying
concept restaurants in terms of themes among restaurant type. In this context, in the research, restaurant
literature and application examples in the world were examined in detail.

Restaurant History
The first transformation of food establishments,
which were established to meet the needs of travelers
and eat and serve the commons, took place in France,
in 1766. It is not a coincidence that the foundations
of the modern restaurant, which is defined as
commercial enterprises that provide the needs of
individuals outside the house through a space and
serve according to a certain service system, are
realized in France. With the revolutions taking place
in France, the chefs serving the noble class became
unemployed and the quest for haute cuisine, which
the noble class could consume outside the palace,
was the basis of the emergence of the first modern
restaurants (Morgan, 2006). In 1766, Maison de
Sante, which can be expressed as the first example of
concept restaurants with food and beverage theme,
was opened in France by Boulanger. The restaurant,
which means a health house, has become history
as the first modern restaurant by offering healing
broths prepared with vegetable juices to individuals
sitting at separate tables through a menu and service
system. Another modern restaurant of this period,
Le Grande Taverne de Londres, opened in 1782 in
Paris, serves fine cuisine. It was the first example of
today’s luxury restaurant type by presenting it with
a superior service understanding in a place with
stylish design also (Spang & Şener, 2007).
The spread of restaurants in France was
realized in 1791 with the abolition of guilds and
the emergence of the concept of competition by
multiplying commercial enterprises. In addition,
this is linked to the Industrial Revolution both
France and the world. Living and working
conditions in the city, which emerged as a result of
the Industrial Revolution, led to the emergence of
the first examples of restaurants offering fast food as
individuals searched for places to eat at lunch breaks
(Schlosser, 2012).
Restaurants in Turkey have developed in 1820.
Tourists who came to Istanbul by steam ships and
trains met the need to eat outside in Pera. Pera
was the first modern and national themed concept
restaurant example in Istanbul. It reflected French
culture with its menu, service and interior design.
There are also examples of table d’hote restaurants
in Istanbul that offer a few pieces of mutton, rice,
salad and yoghurt (Onaran, 2015).
With all these, in the 2000s, restaurant type
and functions have increased gradually and
the restaurants that want to differ from the
other restaurants in the sector are trying to

differentiate by using food, beverage, service,
interior design or all these elements together.
In the literature, restaurants are categorized
according to regulation, scale, structure, service and
type based. Besides, restaurants are categorized type
based as follows (Montagne, 1977):

restaurants for families).
Concept restaurants, which reflect a stated
theme with food, beverage, service and interior
designs, do not appear in these classifications. In
this research, concept restaurants and its type are
examined in detail.

Concept Restaurants and Concept
Restaurant Type
The origin of the word concept derives from
the Latin conceptus (embrace, comprehend, be
pregnant) verb. According to Cambridge Dictionary,
concept means principle and idea (Cambridge
Dictionary, 2019). The word “theme” means “main
subject” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2019). In this
context, concept restaurants can be defined as
restaurants that reflect a stated theme with food
drinks, services and interior designs. With these
feature’s concept restaurants also create an identity
for their differentiated food and beverage service
process. Ethnic restaurants and themed restaurants
are considered very limited in the literature (Bekar
and Dönmez, 2014). However, ethnic restaurants
and themed restaurants should be evaluated under
the title of concept restaurants. Considering the
dictionary meaning of concept (Cambridge, 2019),
it is clear that concept restaurants cover ethnic or
themed restaurants in terms of food, beverage,
service and interior designs.
On the other hand,
01
concept restaurants can be classified in different
themes according to examples in world.

4th International Tourism Congress

Food and Beverage Themed Concept Restaurants
Food and beverage themed concept restaurants which are one type of concept restaurants design their menu
contents, services and interiors in harmony with a food or beverage theme they choose. Meat restaurants, fish
restaurants, wine and coffee houses are the examples of these type of restaurants. Food and beverage themed
concept restaurants offer food and beverage as a theme and differ from the specialized restaurants offering
only one food in the menu content. However, it should be said that, with serving only soup Maison de Sante,
being the inventor of Margharita Pizza Pietro and borek and panch restaurants in Ottoman are first examples
of food and drink themed concept restaurants (Morgan, 2006; Castaldo, 2014). While these restaurants in
history focus on a single food for ease of purchase, preparation and presentation, concept examples of today
provide cost, quality and niche marketing with single food and beverage. Zauo Restaurant in New York City is
one of the food-themed concept restaurant examples. The restaurant focuses on fish and seafood products in
its menu and adapts successfully this theme to service and interior design. The restaurant serves its customers
in a ship-designed space and includes customers with hunting experience. Customers who catch fish and
seafood in the pools can eat their caught food. Their food is served with suitable service equipment for fish
and seafood theme with regard to colors and materials also (Tripadvisor, 2019).

Image 1. =DXR1HZ<RUN =DXR1HZ<RUN 

El Capricho, another successful example of food themed concept restaurants, has become
one of the best meat restaurants in the world by reflecting the meat theme to its menu,
service and interior design. The restaurant is located on a cattle ranch in Jimenez de Jamuz
in Spain and serves the meats with meat cutting and cooking shows (Tripadvisor, 2019).
History of beverage themed concept restaurants date back to the oldest breweries and wine houses. U Fleku,
is one of these restaurants opened in Prague in the 1499. Restaurant has served to banquets, cocktails and
event as well as being a museum (U Fleku, 2019). Nowadays, beverage themed concept restaurants have
also opened for soft drinks such as coffee and tea. One of them is The Coffee Academics serving in Hong
136

Kong since 2010. The restaurant is a good example that can adapt the theme of coffee to service and interior
design. The interior design was based on an open kitchen for interaction with the customers and the service
is carried out with various equipment to perform a cooking coffee show (The Coffee Academics, 2019).

Image 2. The Coffee Academics, Hong Kong (The Coffee Academics, 2019).

National and Ethnic Themed Concept Restaurants
National and ethnic themed concept restaurants reflect their regional food culture with their services and
interior designs. Turkish, French, Italian restaurants are national themed while Circassian and Bosnian
restaurants are ethnicity themed concept restaurant examples. Salamis Chinese Restaurant is one of the
examples of national themed concept restaurants in North Cyprus. The restaurant serves Chinese dish to
customer with Waribashi and Chinese special spoon on table covered with a special Chinese table cloth.
Interior design of Salamis Chinese Restaurant was constituted generally red, black, yellow colors and wood
materials (Salamis Chinese Restaurant, 2019).
An example of an ethnic themed restaurant is located in Eskişehir, where the Circassian people
emigrated during the Ottoman period. Kafkas Kültür Evi, which serves Circassian dish to customer with
special ethnic music was designed according to Circassian culture ingredients. In addition, the restaurant is
a living museum (Foursquare, 2019).

Place Themed Concept Restaurants

01

Place themed concept restaurants constitute their menus, services and interiors through the place theme. The
place as a theme can be related to the establishment of the restaurant or independent. Considering that service
location is the primary effect among the restaurant preference factors of the customers (Rapoport, 1990), it is
important that restaurants use the place to increase the impact of their experience. In this context, Fortezza
Medicea, which was established in a historical prison in Fortezza Medicea Castle in Italy, is one of the concept
restaurants that reflects its theme through its establishment. In the restaurant, menu was composed of a table
d’hote menu and customers have eaten their food with the supervision of the guard (Tripadvisor, 2019).
137

4th International Tourism Congress

Christon Cafe is located in Tokyo as an example of a restaurant that reflects the theme of place to the
menu and service through interior design rather than the establishment place. The restaurant’s interior was
designed with a church theme and Italian cuisine is served related to the church. In addition, meals are
served in a coffin in the restaurant and are eaten with special crusade service equipment’s (Christon Cafe,
2019)

Fairytale, Series and Movie Themed Concept Restaurants
Fairy tale, series and movie themed concept restaurants reflect international fairy tale, series or movies to
their menus, services and interior designs. There are mostly fairy tale and movie themed in application. The
idea that restaurants make a difference by choosing fairy tales and films as a theme is related to influences
and revenue of fairy tales and films, and even more fantastic films. On the other hand, individuals who
want to escape the true stories in they live, explain the desire to experience the free time in the restaurant
with this theme (Lim, 2009). The Green Dragon Inn is an example of a concept restaurant that reflects the
fantastic film of The Lord of the Rings, which does not accidentally reach a huge fan by telling the battle
between remain good and the desire to be bad and strong. Located in Hobbit Village, where the film was
shot in New Zealand, the restaurant integrated its interior with this place. The restaurant adapted its menu
according to the legendary hobbits and menu was composed of vegetarian-friendly dish. Service reflects
hobbits dining eating from the same table (The Green Dragon Inn - Hobbiton Movie Set Tours, 2019).
The Hogwarts Cafe reflects the film of Harry Potter, which makes a great impression with its fantastic
subject is located in New Delhi. The restaurant uses the name and the logo of the school of witchcraft and
designs its interior with flags, posters and accessories of witch groups. The Hogwarts Cafe composed of the
menu groups from the film series, also serves the dish like witch meals in the film in point of appearance
(The Hogwarts Cafe, 2019).

Image 3. The Green Dragon Inn, New Zeland (The Green Dragon Inn - Hobbiton Movie Set Tours, 2019).

Historical Event and Phenomenon Themed Concept Restaurants
Historical event themed concept restaurants reflect to historical events such as revolutions, explorations
and inventions while phenomenon themed concept restaurants make it through some daily phenomenon.
An example of a technology is one of the most important phenomenon today and shape our lives. In this
context, Eatsa is a technology phenomenon themed concept restaurant and it is located in California. In the
restaurant, which does not have any kitchen, service and safe staff, customers order their menu on smart

138

menu screens and then take their meals from digital food receiving units. Also, the customers pay their
meals through digital payment system (Eatsa,2019).
An interesting example of menu, service and interior design based on the phenomenon of war is located
in the Beirut. Buns and Guns Restaurant which design its interior as military base, serves the meal by staff
wearing military uniform with gun and bomb sounds. Also, the restaurant serves its menu including meals
such as killer burger, poisoned sandwich (Facebook, 2019).
An example of a historical event themed concept restaurant is the Gasova Lampa in Ukraine Lviv. The
restaurant reflects the invention of the gas lamp and design its interior with sculpture and pictures of Ignacy
Lukasiewicz who invented the gas lamp. The restaurant’s menu constituted cocktails weightily and serves
with scale containers to remind the experiment (Tripadvisor, 2019).

CONCLUSION
As a result of the French Revolution, the chefs in the palace became unemployed, and the industrial
revolution led to the supply of food that meet the need for eating out in the modern city. In this context, in
the 1800’s, the concept of modern restaurant emerged first in France. The increasing number of restaurants
that can be defined as food and beverage establishments that meet the needs of individuals to eat out through
a space and service system has led to the differentiation of restaurants by acquiring various functions. On
the other hand, the fact that the restaurants have become inseparable due to the competitive conditions,
has encouraged the restaurants to constitute their identity. As a result of all these developments the concept
restaurants have emerged as an experience space with stated one theme. Concept restaurants which can be
defined as food and beverage establishments, reflect a stated theme with food and beverage, service and
interiors. Although there is a very limited number of studies on concept restaurants in the literature, there
are no findings of studies that classified concept restaurants among restaurant type. In the study, restaurant
literature and application examples in the world were examined and it is seen that concept restaurants can
be defined among the type of restaurants. It is seen that also concept restaurants can be classified in its kind
as follows:

As a result of the research, it is suggested for the literature that concept restaurants should be examined
with different techniques and aspects, new restaurant applications in the world should be examined in
terms of menu, service and new restaurant classification should be made.

ABSTRACT

T

he aim of this study is to develop and validate a scale to measure the perception of the gastronomic
experience of tourists in destinations. In this respect, data were collected from 485 domestic
and foreign tourists through surveys. Firstly, exploratory factor analysis was performed and a
4-factor structure (food and beverage establishments, food and beverages, staff, and other gastronomic
components) was obtained in accordance with the theoretical framework. It seemed that Hierarchical
cluster analysis (Ward’s Method) proved the existence of this 4-factor structure. Finally, the four-factor
structure was validated by confirmatory factor analysis. Recommendations have been made regarding
the use of the four-factor structure in future research.
Keywords: Gastronomy Experience Scale, Gastronomy Tourism, Ward’s Method.

INTRODUCTION
For recent decades, tourism has experienced continued growth and deepening diversification to become
a global phenomenon. Besides, the desire to taste authentic and ethnic food is also emerging as a new
phenomenon in the industry. Destinations are aware of the importance of gastronomy in order to diversify
tourism and stimulate local, regional and national economic development. According to Symons (1999)
regional gastronomy is a key component of a destination for attracting tourists as a pull factor. Kivela and
Crotts (2005:51) suggest that destination’s gastronomy can create remarkable and loyal market segment in
terms of economic value. For this reason, it can be said that the gastronomy experience is a powerful tool in
destination marketing. In this sense, destination’s gastronomy performance is very important and for Smith
and Costello (2008:100) satisfaction is a critical indicator of destination’s performance. Finding out how
well a destination’s gastronomy is performing, a necessary tool should be examined in order to measure
the level of satisfaction. This study aims to propose a measurement tool for the level of tourist’s gastronomy
experience perception in a destination by an empirical research. For this purpose, the structures of the scale
were examined by exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and confirmatory factor
analysis.

LITERATURE REVIEW
The measurement of tourist satisfaction at the destination level has been explored before by tourism
researchers. According to Lee (2016:472) at first, the “tourist satisfaction” research centered upon the
product and service, for example, studies on the influencing factors on the satisfaction serving to improve
the service quality of the hotels, hostels, and restaurants and so on. Yet in the recent years, an increasing
number of scholars consider the competition among tourism destinations has evolved from one of the
tourism resources, products and the tourism industry, to one of comprehensive strength, and one of
the important facets to evaluate the tourism destination is precisely the tourist satisfaction (Chen, et al.
2012:593). Satisfaction scales that started with such as Servqual, ServPerf, HotelZot and Dineserv have
been pioneers in developing satisfaction scales that measure destination perfomance such as HOLSAT,
TourServQual (Yarış, 2014:4). Tibe and Snaith (1998) developed HOLSAT, a service quality measurement
model for tourist destinations, to compare the negative and positive aspects of experience and expectations of
vacationers. Eraqi (2006) developed TourServQual, also called TServQual, to evaluate customer satisfaction
in tourism sector. When we look at the studies about the gastronomy satisfaction of tourist in the literature
there are some studies which overemphasizing food service or gastronomy. For example; Nield, Kozak,
and Legrys (2000) examined the role of food service in tourist satisfaction. Along with components such
as quality, diversity, food service standard, presentation of food, and speed of service, Nield et al. (2000)
found that food service is an important factor in tourist satisfaction. Kim et al. (2011) point out that food is

142

considered one of the most important components
in tourism. According to Quan and Wang (2004),
food should be considered a primary attraction
and peak experience that motivate tourists to visit
because tourists’ food experience is one of the
major activities and expenditures of tourists at a
destination. Another study undertaken by Kivela
and Crotts (2006) demonstrated that Hong Kong
gastronomy played a significant role in creating
a quality visiting experience for tourists, which in
turn influenced their revisit intentions. Kivela and
Crotts (2006) also found that dissatisfaction with
gastronomy would negatively influence tourists’
quality perceptions of a destination.
Satisfaction of destination’s gastronomy is not
just about the perceived food quality, food price,
appearance and etc. Duttagupta (2013:41) states
that in relation to a culinary experience, satisfaction
is predicated on a range of elements as opposed to
individual aspects of the experience such as taste,
service, and ambience. Liu and Jang (2009) point
out that satisfaction in a hospitality setting is a
factor of the material product, the behavior and
attitude of employees, and the environment. Correia
et al. (2008) suggest that gastronomy satisfaction in
a tourism setting is a multidimensional construct
comprising three factors: ‘gastronomy’, ‘price and
quality’ and ‘atmosphere’. According to their study,
among these three factors, ‘gastronomy’ was the most
important determinant of tourist satisfaction. This
study aims to find what are the key characteristics
of the top gastronomic destinations? According to
Karagkouni (2012), gastronomic destinations (e.g.,
France, Spain, Italy, etc.) gastronomy in the tourism
context includes a mix of products, services, activities
that underline the typical products and recipes of a
region, the talent and creativity of those who prepare
them, and the uniqueness and tradition of a place,
so that they can offer the visitor a complete and
memorable gastronomic-travelling experience. In
this context, it can be said gastronomy satisfaction
is not just about foods and restaurants but also
about other factors such as employees, events and
gastronomic activities. This study proposes a model
that gastronomy satisfaction in a tourism setting is
multidimensional construct which involves food
and beverages (F&B), F&B establishments, F&B
employee and other gastronomic experiences.

Food and Beverage (F&B)
Food and beverages, the raison d’être of gastronomy,
affects customer satisfaction and their next choices.
In other words, according to Ha and Jang (2010)
quality of food is the most critical component of

food experience. Existing researches (Ha and Jang,
2010; Namkung and Jang, 2007) show that the
quality of the food has a positive effect on customer
satisfaction. Food related dissatisfaction affects the
image of both the operator and the destination
negatively. The abovementioned food is the foods
served in the enterprises.

F&B Establishments
F&B establishments are places where production and
consumption activities take place simultaneously
(Yüksel and Yüksel, 2003). And according to Shenoy
(2005), they are the primary places for gastronomy
tourism due to the fact that the dining experience
happens. F&B establishments are the most important
component of food experience. Measuring of food
experience was first developed as meal experience
by Campell-Smith (1967) for the commercial
hospitality industry. Campbell-Smith (1967) noted
that customers assess not only the quality of food
but also the dining experience in terms of service
quality, atmosphere and other factors.

F&B Employee
F&B service is an art that leads people to socialize
and customers enjoy not only the beautiful
appearance of the restaurant but also cultured and
skillful service staff (Sökmen, 2010:300). A study
conducted by Mei et al. (1999) in Australia to
investigate service quality with a Holserv found that
the most important dimension is the staff. Existing
researches (Albacete-Sáez et al., 2007; Arslan, 2010;
Ha and Jang, 2010; Mohsin et al., 2006) show that
F&B employees’ performance is prerequisite for
customer satisfaction.

Other Gastronomic Components
Gastronomic activities are often considered as a
tourist product because they are accepted as part
of tourism (Hall and Sharples, 2008). In order to
promote gastronomy, in addition to cuisines and
culinary cultures, gastronomy events also needed
such as food processing, food stores, food-related
museums, urban restaurant districts and culinary
routes or trails (Horng and Tsai, 2011:287).
Gastronomy events, particularly
food festivals, and
01
such as gourmet tours, food exhibitions, have been
drawing attention in recent years. Furthermore,
especially festivals are becoming increasingly
important in creating recreational experiences
and conveying cultural values (Lin, 2006:37). One
another fact that gastronomic identity is essential.

143

4th International Tourism Congress

According to Parasecoli (2005), food has always
been one of the defining aspects of any social group,
whose members acknowledge each other as such
by the way they eat, by what they eat and by what
they abhor. Gastronomic identity has been used in
many locations to create a unique and memorable
experience for guests (Harrington and Ottonbacher,
2010). Local food does not refer to food served only
in F&B establishments. According to Jahromy and
Tajik (2011) “local” should not be understood food
that only grows in the region but produced and sold.
In brief, other gastronomic experiences are vital for
gastronomy satisfaction.

METHODOLOGY
Research Goal
This study aims to measure structure validity of a
scale used for gastronomy experience perception
in a destination with both principal component
analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis
(HCA). In addition, performing HCA after EFA
is expected to produce similar and / or identical
results. Namely, it is intended to investigate the
aspect of HCA confirming EFA. Confirmatory
factor analysis was applied for both analyses to
test how well the measured variables represent the
number of constructs. The comparison of PCA and
HCA was made for the scale of statistical attitude
previously by Doğan and Başokçu (2010).

Sample and Data Collection
The survey method was used to obtain the required
data. The research sample included both domestic
and foreign tourists so that the questionnaire was
built in two languages: Turkish and English. The
questionnaire was developed based on a review
of previous literature and was modified by the
researcher using a literature review. The items in
the questionnaire were taken from past studies
(Albacete-Sáez et al., 2007; Arslan, 2010; Akgöl, 2012)
on gastronomy and foodservice evaluation and five
items were added by the researcher. According to the
research framework, the items of the questionnaire
were designed for four factors. Appendix B shows
items and factors. The questionnaire was used
to acquire empirical data related to each of the
variables on a 29 item, 5-point Likert-type scale
which 1= strongly disagree and 5=strongly agree.
The sample size was set at 500 and the survey
time frame was designated for 2 months period.
The survey was conducted at the hotels of Mardin

144

Province as the research is about only domestic and
foreign tourists. Tourist is defined as a person who
travels and stays at least one night apart from the
place of residence. Because of this definition, for the
validity of research, the survey needs to be applied
to the people staying at the hotels. Over the 2-month
period, the survey was conducted only on weekends
and a total of 520 questionnaires were gathered. 485
questionnaires were evaluated finally because some
of them had too much incomplete information.
Prior to the main research, a preliminary
examination and a pilot study were conducted to
validate the literature-based attributes. Face validity
and content validity in the preliminary examination
process were conducted. Some of the statements in
the questionnaire have been changed with feedback
received after the preliminary examination. The pilot
study was conducted for 60 tourists to measure pretest internal consistency. The result of the reliability
analysis (Cronbach’s α: 0.92) showed that scale is
acceptable and coefficients of Cronbach’s α of four
dimensions were between 0.88 and 0.79.

Analyses and Results
A number of statistical procedures were carried out
for this study. To reduce 29 items into four correlated
meaningful factors, “principal component analysis”
(PCA) for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and
“Ward’s Method” for hierarchical cluster analysis
was employed. According to Murtagh and Legendre
(2014), PCA and Ward’s method involve different
yet complementary spatial and clustering models
that are fit to the data using the same mathematical
principal. For this purpose, the data was coded
to a statistical program. In PCA, relatively small
numbers of variables are mathematically derived
to use to convey as much of the information in the
measured variables as possible. In other words,
PCA is simply directed toward enabling one to use
fewer variables to provide the same information
that one would obtain from a larger set of variables
(Leech et al., 2005). According to Revelle (1979:57),
hierarchical clustering algorithms can be useful for
scale construction using large item pools. According
to Tuma et al. (2009), Ward’s method is the most
popular hierarchical clustering method used in the
marketing research. Similar to use in conjunction
with PCA, Ward’s method is complementary to
the use of correspondence analysis. Ward’s method
applied to the output of correspondence analysis, i.e.
to the factor projections, implies equally-weighted
observations, endowed with the Euclidean distance
(Murtagh and Legendre, 2014). After PCA and Ward’s
method employed, first-order confirmatory factor

analysis (CFA) was employed for both results. CFA has been widely used as evidence of construct validity
in theory-based instrument construction (Li, 2016:936). The missing data and its rate were investigated by
the missing data analysis. It was seen that the missing data of the items were no more than %0,8. There is no
fixed limit to an acceptable percentage of missing data in the data set for the current statistical inferences
in the literature. Schafer (1999) argues that a missing rate of 5% or less is insignificant. So that, series mean
imputation was performed. Appendix - B shows, description of items in the questionnaire, means, standard
deviation and number of missing values.
PCA with Direct Oblimin rotation was conducted to reduce 29 items into four factors. Barlett’s test
of sphericity and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy were used to check
the degree of inter-correlations among the variables and the appropriateness for factor analysis. Bartlett’s
Test of Sphericity was 6455.2 (P=000) and KMO measure of sampling adequacy was 0.919, indicating that
correlation matrix was suitable for PCA (Leech et al., 2005). The examination of the factor loadings showed
that 2 items (Q9 and Q10) factor loads fell below the 0.50 threshold and cross-loaded. After removing these
two items, Second PCA was conducted. In pattern matrix item Q8’s factor load fell below 0.50, therefore it
was removed. Third PCA revealed a clear structure and defined items were observed to be grouped under
theoretically defined factor. Table 1 shows the result of the third PCA.

these four factors explain approximately 55% of the total data variance.
For hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), Ward’s method was applied and Squared Euclidian distance
measure was used. This technique helps to group items in a way that maximizes the similarity within
clusters (Cebeci, 2016:2). In the analysis, 26 items were included since 3 items were removed in PCA due
to the low factor loads and cross-loads. Table-2 shows the cluster membership result and Figure shows the

Figure 1: Ward’s Method Dendrogram

According to dendrogram shown in Figure-1, items were grouped into four different clusters. Cluster
membership results are exactly the same to PCA results. Hereby, the cluster analysis confirmed the four
theoretically predicted factors - the fixed numbers of factors to extract - in PCA.
For the normal distribution, skewness and kurtosis values of each item in the scales were analyzed.
It has been noted that for each item, skewness and kurtosis should not exceed ±2.0 (Field, 2013; LarsonHall, 2015; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). The average inter-item correlation coefficients give information
about how scale items are related to each other. It is undesirable that the scale items have a high correlation
with each other. According to Neuendorf (2011), the average inter-item correlation coefficients should be
close to 0.40 - 0.50 with a high alpha coefficient. Ferketich (1991) recommended that corrected item-total
correlations should range between .30 and .70 for a good scale. The results of inter-item correlations and
item-total correlations are given in Table 1.
PCA and HCA results were tested by first order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). For construct
reliability, average variance extracted (AVE) and discriminant analysis were evaluated. The fit of the model
146

was evaluated using Chi-square (CMIN), the ratio of the Chi-square to the degrees of freedom (CMIN/DF),
Goodness-of-fit index (GFI), Comparative fit index (CFI), and Root Mean Squared Error Approximation
(RMSEA). The fit indices suggested by Hair et al. (2016) were used to evaluate the model adequacy.
According to Hair et al. (2016) for sample of 250 and over, CMIN/DF values less than or equals 3 indicates
a good model fit, and between 3 and 5 is an acceptable level. CFI and GFI values should be greater than 0.9
and RMSEA values less than 0.08 indicate good fit.
After CFA was performed, factor loads were observed from the standardized regression coefficients
table. It was seen that the factor loadings varied between 0.55 and 0.77 in the standardized regression
coefficients of scale. According to Hair et al. (2016), factor loadings of 0.50 and greater are considered very
significant in practice. Then, the fit indices of CFA were examined. CMIN/DF was 3.527, GFI was 0.86, CFI
was 0.86 and RMSEA was 0.07. Covariance between errors terms were examined in modification indices.
After a few covariance treatments made model fit obtained good values. The results of the goodness-of-fit of
the final modified of the model showed that CMIN/DF was 2.874, CFI was 0.91, GFI was 0.88, and RMSEA
was 0.06. Appendix-A shows the adequacy of the final modified of the model.
Table – 3 shows confirmatory factor analysis item reliability, construct reliability and average variance
extracted. Construct reliability is a superior reliability analysis that illustrates standardized regression weights
and measurement correlation errors for each item (Peterson & Kim, 2013). According to Hair et al. (2016), the
construct reliability coefficient of 0.70 and above indicates good reliability. The construct reliability of the factors
is between 0.79 and 0.87. However, AVE values of factors are below 0.50. Fornell and Larcker (1981) state that if
the AVE value is less than 0.50, but the CR is above 0.60, the construct validity is still sufficient. In addition, all
calculated t-values were statistically significant (p<0.01). It was found that the correlations between the factors
were not higher than the square root of AVE value so that the discriminant validity was ensured.

CONCLUSION
The increasing importance of gastronomic components
for destinations encourages tourism researchers to
study on these issues. Henceforth, studies focusing
on tourists’ satisfaction with their gastronomic
experience will increase without a doubt. This study
aimed to measure structure validity of a scale used for
gastronomy experience perception in a destination.
It is quite obvious that the gastronomy experience in
a destination is influenced by more than one factor.
After PCA and HCA revealed a clear structure of four
factors obtained, first-order confirmatory factor analysis
validated four-factor gastronomy experience scale. It has
been observed that the results of the PCA and Ward’s
method showed compatibility. However, based on the
results, it is not possible to say that either model is fully
compatible. It is important to highlight that the findings
of this study are limited to the scale created by the author
and research sample. Thus, researcher suggests further
research because further research about gastronomy
experience in a destination could use different
approaches attempting to compare the factor structure
of gastronomy experience. In addition, the relationship
between the 4-factor structure obtained in this study
and the different variables such as perceived satisfaction
or revisit in destinations should be examined. In this
study, Ward’s Method which is one of the hierarchical
cluster analyzes is used as supportive of exploratory
factor analysis. After performing exploratory factor
analysis with the fixed number of a factor based on the
theoretical framework, it may be useful to verify the
number of factors with Ward’s method. In this study,
this role of Ward’s Method does not provide sufficient
evidence. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out many
studies examining the relationship between exploratory
factor analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis in the
field of social sciences. In the future, researchers may
associate this scale with different variables. Moreover,
researchers may add or remove items from this scale for
future studies.

ABSTRACT

T

he aim of this study is determine to level of corporate social responsibility activities of food and
beverage enterprises which are operating in Eskişehir and they having the capacity to implement
their corporate social responsibilities. For this purpose, quantitative data collection method
was used in the research. The population of the research consists of food and beverage enterprises in
Eskişehir. However, in order to have the conditions to fulfill corporate social responsibility activities,
food and beverage enterprises with a capacity of less than 50 people were excluded from the research
universe and 57 food and beverage enterprises were selected for the research sample. The obtained data
were described by calculating arithmetic mean and standard deviation values as well as frequency and
percentage distributions. The results show that food and beverage establishments in Eskişehir implement
their social responsibilities towards the state is so much, but they do not implement excessively their
social responsibilities towards suppliers and subcontractors.
Keywords: Social Responsibility, Corporate Social Responsibility, Food and Beverage Enterprises, Eskişehir.

INTRODUCTION
Businesses have same basic objectives like; make a profit, survive, grow and to carry out social responsibility
activities. For many businesses, the most important of these basic objectives are increase to profits. Nowadays,
it is not possible for companies that focus only on profit and ignore their social responsibilities to succeed
in competitive conditions. Especially with globalization, the competitive structures of the markets in which
the enterprises operate are getting difficult. In order to effectively meet the consumer needs of businesses
are necessary to increase the quality, reliability and product diversity of the products and to extend the
services it provides to customers.
In the competitive environment experienced in food and beverage businesses, consumers now prefer
enterprises that are sensitive to social problems (Reich, Xu and McCleary ,2010). In this context, food
and beverage businesses carry out corporate social responsibility projects to ensure the loyalty of existing
customers and to attract potential customers. In this research conducted in Eskişehir. Firstly, information
about the concept of corporate social responsibility was given and then corporate social responsibility
activities were mentioned. In the last part of the study, social responsibility application areas of food and
beverage enterprises were investigated.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The literature on social responsibility (SR) term was first used in a book in 1953 by H. Bowen book which
is Social Responsibilities of the Businessman. In the first literature Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR),
were called as a social responsibility activities. Because at this time, today’s modern companies are not at
forefront of the business world (Carroll, 1999:268). Although the concept of corporate social responsibility is
not a new concept in the literature, this subject has been given great importance recently in scientific studies
(Aktan, 2007:11). The concept of corporate social responsibility was first discussed economically and it was
attempt to determine the extent of responsibilities. However, the researches made in the following years
suggested that the issue is not only about the economic dimension but also there are different dimensions
than the economic dimension (Caroll, 1991;1999).

152

Today, it is seen that there are quite different
definitions of corporate social responsibility in the
literature. A few of these definitions are described
below. But first of all, it will be useful to examine
the definitions of international organizations about
corporate social responsibility.
According to European Commission, corporate
social responsibility is voluntary integration of
businesses with social and environmental issues,
organizational activities and interactions with
social stakeholders (Commision of the European
Communities, 2001:6). The European Commission
considers CSR as a voluntary activity rather than
fulfilling legal requirements.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) addresses that corporate
social responsibility in the context of how businesses
relate to the needs and goals of a society.
Social responsibility is desire to use the
resources of society not only for the interests of
private individuals or institutions, but for interests
and benefits of society (Frederick, 1960: 60).
According to Davis and Blomstrom (1966),
social responsibility is the obligation to consider the
effects of one’s decisions and actions on the whole
social system. Business people carry out social
responsibility activities when they consider the
needs of people who may be affected by business
actions. In conducting social responsibility activities,
business people look beyond the economic and
technical interests of their companies.
Corporate social responsibility is a concept
in which companies have an obligation beyond
the stipulated by law and union agreements to
shareholders and other groups in the society. In
this definition, two aspects of corporate social
responsibility are emphasized. The first is the
obligation must be voluntarily accepted. The
behavior affected by the coercive forces of law or
the union contract is not a social responsibility
behavior. The second one; obligations of the business
provide a service beyond the traditional business
of the business to social groups such as customers,
employees, suppliers and other communities (Jones,
1980: 59-60).
As seen in the description made social
responsibility, the company is more than a concept
that only the applications that will satisfy their
shareholders. Social responsibility goes beyond the
interests of shareholders in enterprises; it is a set of
activities that help increase the profits of customers,
employees, partners, investors and communities
(Anderson ve Bieniaszewska, 2005:7).
First CSR practices in Turkey is modern
application brought by multinational companies

(Ararat, 2008: 255). However, when the practical
aspect of the work is examined, it is seen that
since Seljuk period Turkish society has adopted
a strong institutional philanthropy tradition and
an institutional mechanism which was called the
foundation. Even today, this traditional practice
seems to be continuing. Today, family companies have
established foundations and allocated some of their
profits to these foundations in order to realize social
assistance. When CSR activities of foundations are
examined, educational expenditures, construction
of hospitals, art or cultural centers are the areas
where these foundations frequently perform CSR
activities (Turker, 2008: 412).

REASONS FOR THE FORMATION
OF CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
Today, the formation of a discreet consumer and
investor profile, increased sensitivity to nature,
globalization and international standards become
clearer, states are sometimes inadequate on some
issues; the expectations of the information age group
from the private sectors increased. This situation
forces businesses to change. The factors that increase
the social responsibility practices of enterprises are
as follows (Robbins, 1994: 122):

APPLICATION AREAS
OF CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
Responsibilities to Nature
When some businesses engage in an activity that
affects the external environment, the enterprise
distorts the environment in various ways. For
instance, the formation of waste heaps from a
mining operation adversely affects the environment.
In this respect, the determination of risks related to
environmental threats in the production of goods
and services, production processes for the benefit
of the public or the environment can facilitate the
design of goods or services (Mitroff, 1994: 102).
Some international companies voluntarily carry
out environmental practices even in the absence of
legal sanctions on the environment. Considering
the factors that lead businesses to act voluntarily;
the structure of the market in which they operate,
non-governmental organizations, media or investor
pressures, the image of the business, competition,
and the desire to act proactively against possible
environmental disasters (Acutt, Ross and
O’Riordam, 2004).

Responsibilities to Consumers
Consumers are one of the most important
stakeholders of an enterprise in order to ensure
the continuity of an enterprise. Therefore, it is of
great importance for enterprises to fulfill their
responsibilities towards consumers in full in terms of
continuity (Bayraktaroğlu, İlter and Tanyeri, 2009: 19).
Consumers seem to consider three factors, especially
in terms of products and services. These are health,
trust and quality (Bartol and Martin, 1994: 106-107).
For example; Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automobile
manufacturer, acknowledged that the US diesel

154

vehicles distorted the results of emissions tests and
they recalled 11 million vehicles (Özpeynirci, 2015).
According to some analysts, Volkswagen’s decision will
cost the company more than 6.5 billion dollars. But in
terms of legal sanctions and the image of the company,
Volkswagen had to make this decision.

Responsibilities to Employees
The most basic stakeholder for businesses is their
employees. Businesses with no employees, unhappy
or inefficient employees cannot be expected to
succeed. Therefore, the fact that the enterprises make
their employees happy will provide them with more
efficiency (Bayraktaroglu, İlter and Tanyeri, 2009: 11).
Businesses have some responsibilities towards
their employees. Some of these responsibilities are;
determine the appropriate wage level according
to the standard of living, provide job satisfaction
and improve working conditions, provide working
environment where human relations are valuable,
support career development with vocational
training, create healthy working environments
(Torlak, 2001: 52). Corporate social responsibility
movements against workers’ rights began in the
1990s. Since 90s, many companies have accelerated
their efforts to improve labor practices and workers’
rights on global scale (Hoepner and Yu, 2008: 23).

Responsibilities to Society
Businesses are part of the society in which they live.
Many businesses think they have responsibilities
to local communities and the community.
However, it is difficult to determine exactly what
these responsibilities cover. Businesses think
that they create value for society by providing
employment, paying taxes and minimizing negative
environmental impacts in production. However,
some enterprises are directly involved in social
activities. For instance, educational aids and
donations, concerts, festivals, sports events and so
on. In addition, some businesses show respect for
local culture, traditions and customs and have some
practices to protect these cultures (Pedersen, 2010:
160). For instance; within the framework of the “Kız
Haydi Kızlar Okula” campaign initiated by Turkcell
and the Association for Supporting Contemporary
Life, 150.000 girls were educated in two years
(Bayraktaroğlu, İlter and Tanyeri, 2009: 15). CocaCola 250.000 dollars for this campaign, İbrahim
Etem Ulagay pharmaceutical factory 100.000
dollars, UNICEF 420.000 dollars, Professor. Dr.
İhsan Doğramacı personally contributed 125,000
dollars (www.unicef.org, 2016).

Responsibilities to the State
Among the stakeholders of the enterprises, the state
is the most powerful system. The state regulator
and the state having legal sanction power directly
affect the existence and activities of the enterprises.
However, the decisions of some powerful enterprises
can also affect states (Ak, 2016: 20).

Responsibilities to Suppliers
Businesses need suppliers to perform on their
activities. Responsibilities towards suppliers include
supporting suppliers in developing countries
(Leiberwitz, 2005: 5). The enterprises that supply
the raw materials and services required for the
production of goods offered by enterprises to the
market are very important in terms of the success of
enterprise in the market (Bakırtaş, 2005).
Using the power of enterprises, price pressure
on suppliers, corruption in the purchase of raw
materials, failure to act in accordance with the
agreements, the establishment of cartels and
endangering the assets of suppliers are important
ethical problems between enterprises and suppliers
(Aydemir, 2009: 13).

Social Responsibilities to
Competitors
Businesses must compete against their competitors
within the framework of fair competition rules.
Unethical pricing, efforts to exclude other companies
from the market, their agreement with each other
in order to be stronger, act together in the market,
causing unfair competition and damaging other
businesses. Businesses are in direct relationship
with businesses that provide goods and services
and companies that buy goods and services in the
production process. In addition to these enterprises,
it is necessary to act responsibly towards competing
companies during their activities. Moving with the
aim of eliminating other businesses in the same
market, the enterprise will become a monopoly.
Eliminating competing competitors or using
competition irresponsibly as a force may also cause
harm for the country. (Steel, 2004: 12).

Responsibilities to Shareholders
Another issue that falls within the scope of social
responsibility is responsibility of the enterprise
and managers to shareholders or owners of capital.
According to Rok (2001: 32), CSR is the philosophy

of conducting production and service activities
in order to establish lasting and positive relations
with all stakeholders. Social responsibilities to
shareholders may include accurate registration of
accounts, realistic calculation of profit and loss, and
failure to provide unrealistic missing or misleading
information to shareholders in terms of investments,
activities and plans (Ak, 2016: 19). According to the
principle of transparency in accounting, companies
aim to be transparent to interest groups. In this
regard, businesses should comply with accounting
standards, basic policies, goals and values should
be shared with the public clearly (Özkol, Çelik and
Gönen, 2005: 139).

METHOD
Purpose of the Research
This research was carried out to determine the
corporate social responsibility practices of food and
beverage establishments in Eskişehir as a tourist
destination.
The questionnaire used in the research; Türker
(2009), Oberseder et al. (2013), Pérez and Bosque
(2013), Alvarado et al. (2015), Moisescu (2015),
Akremi et al. (2018), developed a current and more
comprehensive scale consisting of 7 dimensions.
Thus, it was tried to determine the purpose
(economic, ethical, legal, voluntary) corporate
social responsibility activities of the enterprises
within the scope of the sample. The scale consists
of 67 expressions and 7 dimensions. 10 of the 67
statements are to employees of the enterprise, 13
to customers, 9 to state, 6 to competitors, 10 to
the environment, 10 to the community in which
the enterprise lives and 8 to the suppliers and
subcontractors of the enterprise. to determine
the dimensions of responsibility. There is also a
dimension of responsibility to the shareholders,
which are composed of the above-mentioned scales
and generally composed of 8 statements, but this
dimension is not included in the survey since the
companies operating in Eskişehir do not have shares
in the commodity exchanges. Cronbach’s Alpha
value, which indicates the overall reliability ratio
of the scale, is 0.96. When each of the dimensions
is examined separately, the reliability coefficient of
01
corporate social responsibility
for employees is 0.94,
0.93 for customers, 0.99 for government, 0.94 for
competitors, 0.96 for competitors, corporate social
responsibility for society 0.96, corporate social
responsibility for society and the social responsibility
dimension to suppliers and subcontractors was 0.98.

According to the results of the analysis conducted to determine the corporate social responsibility
activities performed in the food and beverage establishments surveyed, the highest average is the
responsibility towards the state (6,13). The end result of legal regulations and sanctions or violations of the
law is considered as a natural consequence of the highest average in this dimension due to the risks that
may be encountered. The second is corporate social responsibility to customers with an average of 6,10. At
this point, it can be said that food and beverage businesses operating in Eskişehir perform more customeroriented at social responsibility practices. In the research, it is seen that the least average dimension (5.13)
is corporate social responsibility practices against suppliers and subcontractors. It has been observed
that food and beverage establishments in Eskişehir are insensitive about whether their corporate social
responsibilities are carried out outside their own businesses. In order to better understand the responses
to deviations and expressions, it is not enough to comment on average. Therefore, it is useful to examine
frequency distributions of answers.

The average and frequency distributions of the food and beverage enterprises in Eskişehir and
participating in the survey questions are shown in the tables below. According to the tables below, the top
and middle managers who answered the questionnaire generally answered the questions positively.

reasonable salary. Managers stated that 42.1% agree and 12.3% strongly agree that they make various and
indirect contributions to improve the quality of life of their employees. During the surveys, it is seen that

with those who work on work or leave days, or organizations that are described as personnel nights. 86.3%
of the respondents think that they give a reasonable salary to the employees. Participants state that they are
against all kinds of discrimination in recruitment and promotion policies and one of the biggest averages

As can be seen in Table 4, the highest average dimension is corporate social responsibility practices
towards customers. It is understood that managers give importance to statements in this dimension.
Providing high quality products for 84.2% of managers is the basic principle of the company. The fact that
quality is so important in the food and beverage sector is seen as a natural result. Similarly, managers state
that their products meet standards. In the case of human health, the application of hygiene and sanitation
rules is seen as both a legal and conscientious responsibility. Similarly, 84.2% of managers perceive this
responsibility as a conscientious responsibility rather than legal responsibilities. It is the expression of the
managers who have the least average of the statements in this dimension to invest in innovation. 24.6% of
managers stated that they partially participated in innovation investments. Technological innovation is
widely used in food and beverage establishments. It is seen that these practices create competitive advantage
in food and beverage enterprises by creating differences compared to competitors (Cankül et al. 2018: 576).
It can be said that approximately ¼ of the food and beverage business is somewhat reluctant to innovate
because of the investment cost.

responsibility practices. The statements in this section are generally very positive. 91.3% of the managers
stated that they applied the regulations completely and timely. Similarly, 91.2% of the managers stated that
they were trying to create employment opportunities. It was a pleasing conclusion that the statements in
this dimension were supported by the administrators both as a legal sanction and some statements in the
dimension beyond the conscientious law.

According to statements of the survey on the corporate social responsibility dimension towards
the natural environment, it is seen that 64.9% of the executives implement practices that reduce energy
consumption. The reason why this ratio is not higher is thought to be due to the high energy consumption
required to provide a luxurious service. However, 64.9% is considered an acceptable level. 61.3% of the
managers stated that they have the necessary equipment to reduce the negative environmental impacts
of their businesses and 59.6% stated that they made investments to prevent environmental degradation.

who do not comply with labor law. Likewise, 45.6% of the managers stated that they helped suppliers and
subcontractors to create a working environment that their employees had.

RESULT
The main purpose of this study is to determine
the corporate social responsibility activity levels
of food and beverage enterprises operating
in Eskişehir Province of the corporate social
responsibility practices, which are very important
for the enterprises. In this context, 57 of the food
and beverage establishments operating in Eskişehir
were included in the sample. The survey technique
was applied to the senior and middle level managers
of these enterprises. In the survey, corporate
social responsibility was measured through seven
basic dimensions. The highest average of these
dimensions is the social responsibility activities
carried out against the state (6,13). According to
this result, it can be said that food and beverage
establishments operating in Eskişehir engage in
social responsibility activities with legal concerns
and implement practices within the scope of these
responsibilities. Similar to this study, Akdogan et
al. 2011, Cingöz and Akdoğan, 2012 It is concluded
that the enterprises in Kayseri Organized Industrial
Zone perform social responsibility activities mainly
due to legal concerns. In addition to this, it is seen
that some of the regulations introduced by the
government in the process of membership to OECD
and European Union are shaping the activities
of their enterprises in terms of corporate social
responsibility (Ararat, 2008: 277).
In this survey conducted in Eskişehir.
Corporate social responsibility dimension that
food and beverage companies attach importance
to is the responsibility of enterprises to customers
with an average of 6,10. This means that food and
beverage establishments carry out corporate social
responsibility activities beyond legal factors and
with some economic concerns. One of the main
reasons for this situation is that corporate social
responsibility practices may have a positive effect
on the financial performance of enterprises. In
some studies, it has been emphasized that social
responsibility activities increase the competitiveness
of enterprises and positively affect the financial
performance of enterprises (Grigore, 2009: 95).
Behind the corporate social responsibility of business
activities they perform as volunteers operating
in Turkey is thought to obtain some economic
interests, they announced to the public through
the media is seen as particularly large enterprises
social responsibility activities. However, in Turkey,
after the donations and help enterprises carry
out activities, significant tax advantages to these
businesses by the government are implemented.
This situation differentiates the voluntary purpose
of corporate social responsibility (Küskü & Fraser,

2004: 69). Sometimes there is a perception that the
public is engaged in philanthropic initiatives in
order to benefit from various tax reductions and
exemptions.
This research conducted in Eskişehir is aimed
at determining the situation. In future studies, new
variables can be added to the research variables
and models can be developed to determine the
predecessors and results of corporate social
responsibility. On the other hand, studies can
be conducted on larger and different groups by
increasing the sample. However, the enterprises
included in the sample were selected from the food
and beverage sector. However, corporate social
responsibility is an issue that is also emphasized and
emphasized by the enterprises located outside these
sectors. Therefore, similar studies can be carried out
in other sectors.

ABSTRACT

T

he economies have begun to give more importance to tourism policies and strategies with the
exponential increase in tourism mobility. Each country develops and implements policies and
strategies to get a share of the tourism market. However, it is seen that regions, even cities, in the
tourism industry are now competing with cities in other countries and with other cities in the country due
to the increased concentration of tourism activity in some regions of the country. Accordingly, tourism
strategies and policies have been developed on the basis of regions and cities. Therefore, the main purpose
of this study is to determine the markets in Antalya, Istanbul, Izmir and Muğla in which area they are
expert and to identify profits of the competition between these cities have. For this aim, Russia, Germany,
Britain, Iran and Ukraine was selected for the study. These are the countries sending the most tourists to
Turkey in 2018, and Shift-share analysis was performed by utilizing the tourist data (secondary data) of
Antalya, Istanbul, Muğla and İzmir in 2013-2018. Thus, the weak areas of the four destinations used in the
study will be identified and recommendation will be given to improve the weak areas of Antalya.
Keywords: Destination Competitiveness, Shift-Share Analysis, Antalya

INTRODUCTION
The economic impacts and size of the tourism sector accelerate the efforts of countries to develop tourism
and achieve a strategic competitive position. Thus, the conditions of competitiveness in the sector are
constantly changing. New services and new destinations are emerging as a result of increased competition
in toruism sector. Destinations and new destination strategies and policies are becoming more important
in terms of increasing the share of countries in tourism. One of the most striking changes in tourism and
service sector since the early 1980s is the globalization of tourism. Over time, the activities of the tourism
sector in regional or national clusters have shifted to global scale (Ritchie and Crouch, 2003). The global
scale of today’s tourism system and the globalization of the tourism sector brought together the importance
of destinations. Countries that want to increase their share of tourism revenues have started to give more
importance to their destinations. This development has brought destination competitiveness.
Countries that want to generate more income from tourism and plan to expand development throughout
the country focus on destinations. Therefore, the competition in the tourism sector is based on destinations.
Destination competition, which is defined as the ability of a destination to present and maintain the tourism
product that will satisfy the tourists to the maximum extent, different from other destinations, with good
quality and good (Bahar, 2005).
Tourism is a sector where the main input is human. For this reason, both tourists and tourism enterprises
encounter problems in certain periods and they tend to change their routes and investments. Since the tourism
sector provides high amounts of income for the countries’ economy, countries are taking serious steps towards
this sector. It is important to follow the return on investments, development and new trends of the sector and
implement the necessary applications. , the main purpose of this study is to determine the markets in Antalya,
Istanbul, Izmir and Muğla in which area they are expert and to identify profits of the competition between
these cities have. Secondary data were used for this purpose. The weak areas of the four destinations in the
study were identified, and recommendations were given to improve the weak areas of Antalya.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Competitiveness is defined as the ability of a destination to create and integrate high value-added products
while maintaining its market position compared to its competitors (Hassan, 2000). According to Ritchie and
Crouch (2003) competitiveness (a business, country or city) is generally both a relative (more competitive
than what?) and a multifaceted concept (what are the distinctive qualities of being competitive?). Numerous
studies have been conducted on destination competitiveness. These studies can be examined in three groups.
Most of the studies in the first group (Ahmed and Krohn, 1990; Vanhove, 2002; Miller et al., 2008) are aimed
at examining the competitive position of specific destinations. In the second group includes, destination
positioning (Chacko, 1998), destination management systems (Baker et al., 1996), destination marketing
(Buhalis, 2000), price competitiveness (Dwyer et al., 2002), destination environment (Mihalic, 2000), nature
based strategic management of tourism (Huybers and Bennett, 2003). The third group of research (Crouch
and Ritchie, 1999) includes models and theories for the development of destination competitiveness.
The Brazilian case can be used to explain how the competitiveness level of the destination varies
according to the approaches used in research. Hypothetically, Brazil’s size, accessibility, broad territory and
general awareness make Brazil a competitive destination among its South American neighbors, however
Brazil’s competitiveness may be reduced if compared to other destinations such as Indonesia or Australia.
In this context, the unique conditions of the tourism cities in our country affect the tourism mobility in
these regions. The nationalities involved in this tourism activity that are also influenced by the unique
characteristics of the city. In order to determine this, it is seen that shift-share analysis is used in the literature.
The shift-share analysis technique has been applied in tourism (Alavi and Yasin, 2000). The first study
in the tourism sector, at the beginning and end of a particular analysis period, performed a typical margin
analysis by measuring employment in the tourism industry in South Carolina for various sectors (such as
air transport, museums, art galleries and golf courses) and then compared them with a benchmark. The
growth that emerged during the period later turned into national growth, industry mix and competitive
impact. The second study focused on the characteristics and dynamics of the tourism market for the four
Middle East countries. In the third study, Sirakaya et al. (2002) examined the employment in the tourism
industry using the shift-share technique. According to Sirakaya et al. (2002: 304), the shift-share technique
is an alternative to econometric methods for policy makers who need a rapid analytical tool to assess
the performance and composition of the tourism industry. Yasin et al. (2004) analyzed the growth in the
number of tourists from five major destinations (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) from four major
regions of the world (America, Europe, East Asia and Oceania, others) between 1992 and 1996.

METHOD
In the study, shift-share analysis was conducted by using the number of tourists arrivals to Turkey by cities
within the scope of 2013-2018 periods. It is a different version of the shift-share analysis technique developed
by Esteban-Marquillas (1972) and used by Alavi and Yasin (2000) to measure the growth in the number
of tourists in the Middle East region (Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Syria). In the study, shift-share analysis was
used to determine the growth and change in the number of tourist arrivals from Russia, Germany, England,
Iran and Ukraine (the countries with the highest number of tourists according to nationality in 2018) to
Antalya, Istanbul, Muğla and İzmir.
The shift-share equation for the tourist received of city (j) from the region (i) is obtained as follows:
T1ij - T0ij = T0ij(GAREA) + T0ij(GiAREA – GAREA) + Tij (Gij - GiAREA) + (T0ij - Tij) (Gij - GiAREA)
The terms of the above equations are defined as follows;
T1ij = Number of tourists visiting city (j) from region (i) for the 1st period.
01
T0ij = Number of tourists visiting city (j) from region (i) for the 0th period.
GAREA = Overall growth rate of the total number of tourists arrivals from all regions from 0 period to
1 period.
T0j = Total number of tourists visiting city (j) from all regions in period 0.
T0iAREA = Total number of tourists arrivals to area from the region (i) in the 0 th period.
T1iAREA = Total number of tourists arrivals to area from the region (i) in the 1st period.
165

4th International Tourism Congress

GiAREA = Growth rate of the number of tourists arrivals to area from region (i) from 0 period to 1
period.
Gij = Growth rate of the number of tourists arriving to city (j) from region (i) in 0th period to 1st period.
Tij = Whern the number of tourists from the region (i) is equal to that of the comparators; it represents
the number of tourists from region (i) to city (j).
According to this equation, the real growth in the number of tourists arrivals from the region (j) to the
city (i) from 0 period to 1 period is divided into four components. These components;
t Area effect [T0ij (GAREA)]. This effect measures the change in the rate of change in the expected
number of tourists in a city with an equal growth rate compared to the city in which it is compared.
The field effect shows the share of that city in tourism compared to the cities in which it is compared.
t Region mix effect [T0ij (GiAREA - GAREA)]. This effect measures the difference between the tourism
growth rate of the number of tourists arrivals from the region (i) and the overall growth rate of the
number of tourists arrivals from the whole region.
t Competition effect [Tij (Gij - GiAREA)]. This effect measures the difference between tourism growth
rate within the number of tourists arrivals from (i) region to (j) city and tourism growth rate within
the number of tourists arrivals from (i) region.
t Allocation effect [T0ij - Tij (Gij - GiAREA)]. This component, also known as the interaction effect,
measures the growth in the number of tourists attributed to the interaction of the regional compound
effect and the competitive effect.
As Alavi and Yasin (2000) point out, a city (i) may have competitive “advantage” or “disadvantage” in
attracting tourists from its region and may be “specialized” or “non-specialized”. These four possibilities are
shown in Figure 1.

Calculations related to general growth rates were made before the shift-share analysis. These calculations
and their results are as follows:
General Growth Rate (GAREA): (14,791,122 – 12,249,626) / 12,249,626 * 100 = %20.75
The above general growth rate formula was applied to all markets and the growth rate of each market
was found. Growth rates of markets;
✓ Russia: % 36.61
✓ Germany: % -13.44
✓ England: % -6.78
✓ Iran: % 273.33
✓ Ukraine: % 79.23

specialized in this market. Antalya has no competitive advantage in the German market, but specialized
in this market. The most important reason for this is that while the number of German tourists arrivals to
Antalya decreases with each passing year, the number of German tourists increases in İzmir and Muğla. In
Istanbul, however, there has been a slight decrease and it continues its advantageous position.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The number and nationality of tourists to a city in a given period of time depends on the characteristics,
diversity, quality of service and specialization and competitive advantage of the tourist supply. Thus, it is
possible to know which market in that city is more advantageous or disadvantageous or in which market it
specializes or does not specialize, and it can be seen in comparison with other cities in a similar position. In
this way, issues such as what the market potential of that city is and how it evaluates this potential and how
this potential develops are revealed.
In this study, the shares they received from the markets of Germany, Russia, England, Iran and Ukraine
to Antalya, Muğla, İzmir and Istanbul in 2013 and 2018 were examined. According to this;
When we examine the cities that have a share in the Russian market, it is seen that Muğla has benefited
from its competitive advantages although it is not specialized. In addition, it is seen that Antalya is both
specialized and benefiting from its competitive advantage. İzmir and Istanbul, however, are not specialized
and do not have competitive advantage in this market According to this; Antalya should continue
its practices to date in order to maintain its strong position in the Russian market. Despite its current
advantageous position, Muğla should make market-specific research in order to specialize in this market.
İzmir and Istanbul should investigate the characteristics and expectations of these market guests in order to
use their competitive advantage in order to specialize for the Russian market and arrangements should be
made to meet these characteristics and expectations.
When we examine at the German market, Muğla province is similar to its position in the Russian market,
although it is advantageous in this market is not specialized. Studies regarding the German market should
be carried out especially to meet the expectations of guests. Although Antalya specializes in the market,
it is disadvantageous in terms of competitive advantage. Izmir and Istanbul are seen to be specialized and
advantageous in this market, however especially since the German market uses these numbers in these two
cities as a hub especially because of the Sunexpress center, and the registration of German citizens of Turkish
01the case for Istanbul, and it
origin living in Germany through Izmir year-round, The same situation is also
is thought that German citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany use Istanbul as a hub in their travels to
our country. If it is possible to differentiate between the tourist and non-touristic entrances to our country,
it is thought that in the light of these new data, Antalya which is at a disadvantage in the competition in the
German market, will turn into an advantageous position. What makes us think is the personal experience
of the German market as a result of article writers having more than 30 years of industry experience and
more than 20 years working as a senior executive in a German-based company.
169

4th International Tourism Congress

When we examine the England market, it is seen that Antalya and Istanbul do not specialize in the
market despite the competitive advantage. Especially the England market has been preferred for these two
cities in recent years and the quality and features of the existing facilities are increasing day by day. General
difficulties experienced in this market may cause problems in the service quality of the facilities which
are physically advantageous from time to time due to the lack of specific details of this market. Moreover,
Muğla and İzmir are disadvantaged due to their lack of competition due to their competitive advantage,
the physical characteristics of the facilities and the price-service performance due to their experience in the
English guests they have worked for many years.
In light of analysis, the evaluations made on the Iranian market Antalya is advantageous although
Antalya is not specialized and Muğla is disadvantageous although it is not specialized. Izmir and Istanbul,
on the other hand, seem to be specialized in this market, but they seem to be disadvantaged. The most
important assessment to be made regarding this market is that the current Iranian tourist figures do not
reflect 100% accuracy due to the fact that direct flights from the cities of Antalya and Muğla to the cities
of this country serving similar concept are not allowed by the Iranian State. Due to this prohibition, a
significant portion of the tourists coming to Muğla region are transported through İzmir and Iran flights
to Isparta within Antalya region are carried to Antalya by road. For this reason, it is not possible to find
out how many of the Iranian guests who seem to have come to Izmir from these data, how many they
actually stayed in Izmir and how many they were transported to Muğla region by road. Similarly, the lack
of numbers of Iranian guests who appear to have entered Isparta does not give the right result for Antalya.
Again, according to the article author’s sectoral experience, if the real data could be obtained, Antalya is
predicted to be both a specialized and competitive advantageous city for the Iranian market and Muğla
as a specialized but competitive disadvantageous city. However, it is assumed that İzmir will change its
position in the specialized as non-specialized while preserving the current competitive disadvantage. Since
the Istanbul data is assumed to be as close to reality as possible, no change in the current status is foreseen.
When we examine the Ukrainian market, it is seen that Antalya, Muğla and İzmir provinces have
competitive advantage although they do not specialize in this market, while Istanbul has a competitive
disadvantage despite being specialized in this market. As can be seen in the light of these findings, it is a
known fact that the Ukrainian guests are mixed with Russian guests. However, Ukrainian guests exhibit
different characteristics due to their personal characteristics and tensions between the two countries and
the guests of the two countries do not like to be together. Therefore, in spite of the price advantage, it seems
that we specialize in these markets because of the lack of services that Ukrainian guests feel special in their
facilities. This distinction is important, especially since these three provinces serve this market with an allinclusive concept. However, due to the high price of accommodation, this market has an economically low
income level and has put Istanbul at a disadvantageous position compared to other cities
In this case, it is thought that the data does not fully reflect the real situation due to the airport-based
data. For this reason, it is recommended that a similar study be conducted through the “Daily Reported
Police Station Lists” based on the mentioned cities for confirmation purposes.

ABSTRACT

T

he purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of happiness among tourism students and
to examine the effects of demographics on levels of happiness among them. A questionnairebased study was conducted on 302 tourism students studying at Manavgat Vocational School of
Akdeniz University. Data were collected using the Oxford Happiness Scale-Short Form and personal
information form. The survey was carried out between May and June 2019. Research data were analyzed
with SPSS 23.0 statistical package program. The level of happiness of the students was found to have
a moderate level. Firstly, the reliability values of the scale used in the study was found to be sufficient.
For the purpose of identifying and examining the underlying dimensions of the scale, a factor analysis
using principal component method was used. As a result of factor analysis, one dimension was obtained
from happiness scale as in the original scale. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests were computed
to assess differences in level of happiness related to demographic variables. Among the demographic
variables gender, status of doing sports, and frequency of doing sports weekly were significantly related
to happiness. However, class, department, working status, social media usage, number of siblings,
spending status, whether mother and father were alive, and whether they were together or separated
were not significantly related to happiness. Considering the impact of sport on happiness, university
and school administrations should develop activities and projects to support students’ ability to do
sports. However, studies on happiness can be executed in different universities and departments.

INTRODUCTION
Researchers in several disciplines are increasingly involved in the research of one of the most complicated
and universally debated topics: the pursuit and achievement of good life (Delle Fave, Brdar, Freire, VellaBrodrick, & Wissing, 2011). On the other hand, subjective well-being, particularly measured with regards
to happiness and life satisfaction is increasingly considered a substantial policy purpose around the world
(Tiefenbach & Kohlbacher, 2013). Happiness is used instead of well-being, in some cases it is used in the
same meaning. People desires to be happy and happiness may be the ultimate main aim that people pursue
in their lives. The question of what generates happiness and well-being is the subject of a great number
of current research, much of it fitting under the section of positive psychology, a developing field that
also considers problems such as what makes for ideal relationships, ideal group functioning, and ideal
societies (Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2007). Happiness has various senses in popular discourse, as well as
in the scientific literature. For instance, happiness can mean a general positive mood, a global assessment
of life satisfaction, living a good life, or the causes that make people happy, with the remark depending
on the context (Diener, 2006). Happiness also can be thought of as an umbrella term that contains lowintensity positive feelings (e.g. tranquility), high-intensity positive feelings (joy, euphoria), and everything
in between (Lyubomirsky & Kurtz, 2008). In recent years, research has been continuing to understand
what makes individuals happy in many disciplines besides psychology. In this context, the purpose of this
study is to investigate the levels of happiness among tourism students studying at vocational school and
to examine the effects of demographics on levels of happiness among them. Besides, it is important for
tourism students to know how to be happy and to learn how to make tourists happy.

LITERATURE REVIEW
There has been a growing interest in the description
and features of a good life for a long time. Positive
psychology tries to give information about the
quality of life of people (Kose, 2014). In this context,
positive psychology focuses on understanding and
explaining happiness and subjective well-being
(SWB) and accurately predicting factors that affect
such situations (Carr, 2004). Happiness is a popular
term that can refer to pleasant moods and emotions
experienced at any given moment (positive affect),
to general evaluations of life such as life satisfaction,
or to subjective well-being (Diener & Ryan, 2009). In
the literature, the term happiness is sometimes used
synonymously with subjective well-being (Diener,
1994). According to Diener (2000), happiness or
SWB refers to: people’s evaluations of their lives--evaluations that are both affective and cognitive. On
the other hand, Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, & Schkade
(2005) define happiness as frequent positive affect,
high life satisfaction, and infrequent negative affect.
Indeed, when psychologists speak of happiness or
well-being, they mean the experience of frequent
positive impact, rarely negative impact, and a sense
that life is good and valuable (Lyubomirsky &
Kurtz, 2008).
Many research have been conducted to identify
the determinants of happiness or subjective wellbeing. For instance, well-being has been indicated
to be related to a wide range of factors, including
demographic variables (e.g., Diener, 1984; Diener
& Diener, 1995; Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999;
Myers, 2000), personality traits and attitudes (e.g.,
Diener & Lucas, 1999), and goal characteristics
(e.g., McGregor & Little, 1998) (Lyubomirsky, et.al.
2005). Happy individuals may think about their
positive life incidents more often than their negative
life incidents, a tendency that serves to pursue their
long-term happiness (Seidlitz & Diener, 1993). Also,
several studies show that happy persons are successful
across multiple life domains, including marriage,
relationships, income, health, longevity, and work
performance. These people are more creative, able
to multitask and endure boring tasks, more trusting,
helpful, and sociable (Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener,
2005; David, Boniwell & Ayers, 2013).
The happiness of students is an important topic.
According to Seligman (1995), the roots of our
happiness as adults are developed in our childhood
(as cited in O’Rourke & Cooper, 2010). Especially,
college years are formative for students and can
lead to lifestyles that endure for the years ahead
(Ibrahim, 2018). The characteristics and behaviors
of the faculty also have important implications for
student development. On the other hand, students’

values, beliefs, and aspirations tend to change in
the direction of the dominant values, beliefs, and
aspirations of the peer group in the college years
(Astin, 1993).
Studies have been realized to better understand
the relationship between demographic factors
and university students’ happiness. For example,
Çakır & Demirel (2019) analyzed the happiness
and life satisfaction levels of university students
by various factors and to reveal the relationship
between those two terms in Turkey. Ibrahim (2018)
determined the degree of 654 male and female
students’ happiness and identify which life domains
have the greatest or least influence on their wellbeing at one federal university in the UAE. Cicek
(2018) investigated the physical activity and quality
of life of sports department students and other
department students attending university. In this
study, a total of 300 university students participated
in Turkey. Abbasi, Timareh, Ziapour, & Kianipour
(2018) analyzed the components of happiness
and the role of demographic variables among the
350 university students in Iran. Gonener, Ozturk,
& Yilmaz (2017) investigated whether mental
(psychological) well-being has an effect on the
level of happiness of university students according
to age, gender, department, class and perceived
academic achievement in a sample of 182 sports
science students. Kaya (2016) examined the effect of
the participation of 1464 college students in leisure
activities and their level of leisure satisfaction on
their happiness based on various parameters. Lesani,
Mohammadpoorasl, Javadi, Ansari, & Fakhari
(2016) evaluated happiness among 541 college
students of medical sciences in Iran terms of sociodemographic variables. Tunc (2015) examined the
effects of sports on social anxiety and subjective wellbeing levels in a sample of 600 university students
at one public university in Turkey. Eraslan (2015)
also investigated the level of psychological wellbeing in a sample of total 306 physical education
and sport department students in Turkey. Flynn &
Macleod (2015) determined which life domain had
the greatest influence on student happiness in 192
students from a small undergraduate university.
Lustyk, Widman, Paschane, & Olson (2015)
investigated the impact of exercise frequency,
intensity, and volume along with exercise motives
on quality of life reports. 169 college students from
a liberal arts university
01 in the Pacific Northwest
participated in this survey. Cetinkaya (2013)
revealed that Turkish college students’ subjective
wellbeing in regard to psychological strength and

Satisfaction Scale from a sample of 522 students at a Midwestern University. Alavi (2007) determined the
measure of happiness in 573 university students in Iran, and the relationship between happiness and some
individual characteristics of the students. Chow (2005) reports the findings from a questionnaire survey of
315 university students’ life satisfaction in Regina. On the other hand, Diener & Seligman (2002) investigated
for high happiness using multiple confirming assessment filters in a sample of 222 undergraduates.

METHODOLOGY
Participants and Procedure
This study was executed in three basic stages: sampling, data collection, and data analysis. Sampling design
and sample size are significant subjects to statistically represent the population and to be able to suggest
implications in both theory and practice. The participants of this study are comprised by 302 tourism
students studying at Akdeniz University Manavgat Vocational School. The survey was carried out between
May and June 2019.
The socio-demographic details of the students are given in Table 1. The average age of the students in the
study was 20.6. 57.9% of the students were male and 42.1% were female. Concerning class of the students,
58.6% were first-grade and 41.4% were second-grade. The majority of the students (80.8%) attended the
daytime course. The rest of the students (19.2%) attended the evening course. Distribution of the students’
department was as follows: 50.3% tourism and hotel management, 27.5% were gastronomy, and 22.2% were
tourism and travel services. The vast majority of the students (41.1%) spent 501-1000 TL per month. 45.3%
of the students were doing sports. On the other hand, 54.3% of the students were not doing sports. Weekly
average sports time of the students in the study was 1.32 (S.D.=0.11).

Measures
To examine tourism students’ happiness, a questionnaire including 20 items, in two parts were designed:
7 questions related to happiness; 13 items related to the demographic data. The most commonly used
measurement tool in happiness research is the Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI) with its various forms

174

(Dogan & Akıncı Cotok, 2011:166). The OHI was developed by Argyle, Martin, & Crossland (1989) and
comprises 29 items, each involving the selection of one of four options that are different for each item.
Argyle et.al. (1989) claimed that happiness included three main components: the frequency of positive
affect or joy, the high level of life satisfaction experienced during a specific life process, and the lack of
negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, fear (Dogan & Akıncı Cotok, 2011:166). The Oxford Happiness
Questionnaire (OHQ) has been derived from the OHI by Hills & Argyle (2002). The OHQ includes similar
items to those of the OHI, each presented as a single statement which can be endorsed on a uniform sixpoint Likert scale. In the same study (Hills & Argyle 2002), the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire short form
(OHQ-SF) is developed eight-item measure of happiness. The OHQ-SF was translated into Turkish and its
validity-reliability studied by Dogan & Akıncı Cotok (2011).
The questionnaire also included a demographic section, which asked for the following information:
gender, class, department, course status, status of doing sports, frequency of doing sports weekly, working
status, social media usage, number of siblings, amount of monthly expenditure, whether mother and father
were alive, and whether they were together or separated. Cronbach’s a coefficient was used to evaluate the
internal consistency of the short form of the OHQ. The alpha coefficient for this study was 0.73 and this
is similar to Dogan & Akıncı Cotok (2011). For the purpose of identifying and examining the underlying
dimensions of the instrument, a factor analysis using principal component method was used. Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests were computed to assess differences in level of happiness related to
demographic variables. Analyses were performed using SPSS 23.

ANALYSIS OF FINDINGS
Mean, standard deviation, and alpha score of the OHQ short form are shown in Table 2 for the students. As
can be seen in Table 2, the mean (standard deviation) were 3.36 (±0.76) for happiness. This result indicates
that the happiness level of the tourism students was found to have a moderate level.

Factor Analysis
A principal factor analysis was performed on items in order to identify dimensions of the instrument.
Bartlett’s test of sphericity with a value of 572.374 (p < 0.001) and the calculation of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
statistics of 0.82, pointed out that data seemed suitable for factor analysis. Taking the distribution of the
scree-plot into consideration, principal component factors with an eigenvalue of one or greater were rotated
by the varimax analysis. About 7 items from the factor analysis resulted in one factor grouping and explained
44% of the total variance. Most of the factor loadings were .0.60, indicating a good correlation between the
items and the factor grouping they represent. Consequently, factor structure of the OHQ short form in this
study was same from the factor structure of the original OHQ short form.

mother and father were alive, and whether they were together or separated. Among the demographic
variables gender, status of doing sports, and frequency of doing sports weekly were significantly related to
happiness. However, class, department, working status, social media usage, number of siblings, amount of
monthly expenditure, whether mother and father were alive, and whether they were together or separated
were not significantly related to happiness.
Female tourism students (M=3.47, SD=0.76) were happier than male tourism students (M=3.27,
SD=0.75). Students who were doing sports (M=3.49, SD=0.77) happier than students who were not doing
sports (M=3.28, SD=0.75). On the other hand, students who were doing sports just one day in a week
(M=3.59, SD=0.84) have significantly higher mean levels of happiness than students who were doing sports
more than one day (M=3.36, SD=0.71), and students who were not doing sports (M=3.29, SD=0.75). The
results are shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire short form was used to evaluate the happiness of tourism students in
this study. Tourism students showed a moderate level of happiness with an average of 3.36.
The OHQ short form items were exposed to a principal component analysis with varimax rotation in
this study. One factor structure was obtained as a result of this factor analysis. This factor structure was
the same with the original structure of the OHQ short form. Dogan & Akıncı Cotok (2011) also reported
that the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated that the OHQ short form had a
unidimensional structure.
Among the demographic variables gender, status of doing sports, and frequency of doing sports weekly
were significantly related to happiness of tourism students. Female tourism students were happier than
male tourism students in the current study. Similarly, Çakır & Demirel (2019) stated that according to
the happiness scale a significant difference has been observed with respect to gender, department, grade
and department satisfaction parameters. Ibrahim (2018) found that happiness was significantly greater
for female students than for male students. Abbasi et.al. (2018) reported that there was a significant

176

relationship between the total score of happiness
and gender. Coşkun (2017) also revealed that
female students were found to have higher levels
of happiness than male students. Cetinkaya (2013)
stated that gender was found to be associated with
college students’ subjective wellbeing. Eraslan
(2015) found that psychological well-being of
female students is significantly higher than the male
students. However, Gonener et.al. (2017) revealed
that there was no significant difference between
happiness scores of the students according to their
gender. Kaya (2016) also reported that happiness
levels of the students do not show a significant
difference according to the gender variable. Flynn &
Macleod (2015) found that there was no difference
in happiness related to gender. Mohammadi,
Batvandi, & Saberi (2015) revealed that there were
no significant differences in the happiness levels
between the male and female university students.
Zullig et.al. (2009) found that mean overall scores
did not differ significantly by gender, year in school,
or race. Alavi (2007) also reported that there was
not a meaningful relationship between gender and
happiness of the university students.
Students who were doing sports happier
than who were not doing sports. Besides that the
difference in means of happiness for students who
were doing sports just one day was statistically
different and higher than who were not doing
sports. In the frequency of doing sports weekly
groups, students who were doing sports just one
day also have significantly higher mean levels of
happiness than who were doing sports more than
one day. Cicek (2018) also found that the students
in the sports faculty had a higher level of physical
activity and quality of life scores than students
in other department. Alemdag, Alemdag, &
Ozkara (2016) found that university students who
participated in physical activity showed subjectively
higher levels of perceived happiness. Lesani et.al.
(2016) revealed that people with high happiness
scores had a healthier lifestyle, i.e. more physical
activity and less tobacco smoking. They stated
that college students should be encouraged to do
regular exercise as a way to increase the happiness
level. Tunc (2015) explored that well-being scores of
university students who do sports are higher than
the ones who don’t do sports. Mohammadi et.al.
(2015) claimed significant differences in happiness
levels between physically active and semi-active
students, and between physically active and nonactive students. Lustyk et.al. (2015) explored that
high-frequency exercisers had significantly higher
health, helping, and community-related quality of

life than those who exercised less frequently. The
authors noted significantly higher health related
quality of life in the heavy volume group compared
with the other volume groups. However, Diener &
Seligman (2002) reported that compared with the
less happy groups, the happiest respondents did not
exercise significantly more, participate in religious
activities significantly more, or experience more
objectively defined good events.
Class, department, working status, social media
usage, number of siblings, amount of monthly
expenditure, whether mother and father were alive,
and whether they were together or separated are
not significantly related to happiness of tourism
students in the current study. Likewise, Gonener
et.al. (2017) found that there was no statistically
significant difference between the average scores
of happiness and departmental and class variables.
However, Chow (2005) expressed that students
were most satisfied with relationship with mother,
living environment, relationships with close friends,
relationships with siblings, and living arrangement.
Valenzuela, Park, & Keefind (2009) found positive
relationships between intensity of Facebook use and
university students’ life satisfaction. Dogan (2016)
also claimed that social network site (SNS) usage
significantly and positively predicts happiness; in
other words, usage makes high-school students
happy.
Happiness of university students is an important
matter that needs to be researched further in the
universities. Because, it is related to many important
factors, such as quality of life, student performance,
productivity, physical, and mental health. On the
other hand, studies on the happiness of university
students can help the university managements and
teachers to develop the quality of education. This
study has also significant implications for university
managements. Primarily, the results from this study
can help the school and the university managements
to increase the happiness level of students. Besides,
the results of this study can guide university
managements to understand the factors that affect
happiness of the students. Above all, it is important
for university students who study tourism to learn
the ways of being happy and to know how to make
tourists happy when they enter work life.
On the other hand, it would be useful that future
studies should be replicated within the prescribed
01 variables such as social
time limits, considering
support, self-esteem, student performance, stress,
depression, and insomnia.

ABSTRACT

O

ther than overly-consumed mass tourism, the preferences for recreational activities, vacationing
in untouched, clean and extravagant surroundings with nature far from the city have become
an aspiration for many people. The changes in consumption behaviours have driven people
away from sea, sun, sand tourism to direct source-based leisure activities, where they can be alone
with nature. In this context, one of the most commonly used recreational behaviours is Alpinism. In a
modern sense, Alpinism is more different than climbing to the top of a mountain or the face of a rock
(Mahruki, 1996). In modern Alpinism, climbing, hiking, trekking, exploring and climbing and walking
in bouldering is a recreational activity performed together in mixed techniques. In these tours, the tour
guides are responsible for the security of the tourists and the logistics by solving all kinds of problems.
In this sense, training of the guides is crucial to increase their knowledge and skills.

Realise quality service in the environment; it is necessary to have a good education. In this context,
the curricula for the people to be educated must have a dynamic structure. Therefore, updating of
curricula is necessary for qualified learning. In the field of tourism guidance education, it is crucial
to determine the appropriate methods and techniques employing needs analysis and to prepare the
curriculum according to the needs of the individual, society and work area. Within the framework
of the knowledge skills and competencies that Alpinism gait leaders should have within the scope of
the laws, it is thought that giving pieces of training in tourism guidance undergraduate programs will
contribute to professional specialisation.
For this reason, it will be a more scientific approach to include the changes seen in tourist consumption
behaviours and the knowledge of the programs prepared for tourism guidance education in the subbranches of alpinism. Bearing these in mind, this study aims to examine whether there are skills and
competencies offered at the undergraduate level of tourism education in Turkey in tourism guidance
program. In this context, the curriculum in 25 guidance programs has been investigated with specific
reference to Turkey Mountaineering Federation Gait Leadership Instructions. After the examination of
the curricula, the congruence to the program of Turkey Mountaineering Federation will be discussed,
and general recommendations will be put forward.
Keywords: Tour Guides, Alpinism, Guiding Curriculum, Guiding Education

INTRODUCTION
While the developments in the fields of politics, economy, technology and education in the globalised world
lead to social enrichment, this situation has become inversely proportional to the lifestyle of individuals and
prefer a more lifestyle away from luxury. Except for the ones in the living environment; desire for the natural
has caused a significant change in the leisure activities outside the working and leisure time of individuals. The
most important recreational activity to get away from urban life is; mass is tourism. However, in the reality of
the twenty-first century, people adopt the concept of vacationing away from the city, surrounded by nature,
virgin, clean and not exaggerated. As a result, changes in consumption behaviours have driven people away
from mass tourism based on sea, sun, sand and culture, leading them to resource-based leisure activities
where they can be alone with nature. In this context, the most resorted recreational behaviour, which is far
from all human and technological elements, is carried out to isolate from the city life in all weather conditions

180

by staying alone with nature in the countryside is
Alpinism (Arslantürk and Gül, 2019).
In the statistical reports prepared by the World
Tourism Organization and Adventure Tourism and
Trade Union, it is stated that economic mobility
created by resource-centred recreational activities
has a share of 400 billion dollars in the total tourism
movement of 1.2 trillion dollars in the world in
2014. This shows that the economic volume has
a share of 30% in general tourism activity. Global
tourism movements around the globe show an
average growth of 4 to 7%, while resource-based
recreational activities are reported to have increased
by 20 to 30% (Türsab, 2014).
In the Global Report on Adventure Tourism
report published by the World Tourism Organization
in 2014, it was determined that the travel agencies
providing resource-based tourism activities with
easy-qualified tourism services spend an average of
308 dollars per person per day in the organisations
realised in 2012. With an average of 8.8 days on
organised trips, the total cost per person, excluding
flights, is US $ 2,710 (ATTA, 2013). Everest mountain
climbing is the most suitable example to determine
the numbers of difficult tourism services that are
resource centred. For permission to climb Mount
Everest, the Nepalese government is required to pay
USD 11,000 per person for 2018. Besides, the total
costs of training, equipment, air tickets, tour guides,
etc. cost around $ 48,000 per person for Everest.
Among these, the Nepalese government confirms
that the climbing guides receive approximately $
6,000 per climb. It is also known that the total wages
paid by the mountain guides up to 10,000 dollars
(GRAT, 2014, Mountlet, 2019).
In this context, Turkey is surrounded by sea on
three sides, face measurement of the 28% covered
with forest, unmatched in the Mediterranean basin
and relatively unspoiled natural beauty, experiencing
at the same time the four seasons is a more wealthy
country than European countries. The majority of
resource-based recreational areas are protected
national parks, nature areas, nature protection
areas, nature monuments and wetlands (Orfamder,
2018). As of 2018 in Turkey; There are 44 national
parks, 247 natural parks, 114 natural monuments,
30 natural conservation areas and 81 wildlife
development areas. Other significant resourcecentred recreational resources are wetlands. In
terms of these sources, it has 53 wetlands of national
importance to Turkey. It has the wealthiest wetlands
compared to Europe and the Middle East (DKMP,
2019). A total area of protected areas in Turkey,
which corresponds to 8.1% of the country’s surface
area (Orfamd, 2018).

All the countries in the Mediterranean basin,
its commercial competitor Turkey in tourism,
considering that focus on plans and strategies
for eco-tourism must firstly give importance to
infrastructure. Given the wealth of resource-centred
recreational areas, it will serve in these areas; Having
qualified tourism workers will be the most significant
infrastructure work. The purpose of this study,
graduate-level programs in Turkey, tourist guides,
is to reorganise by Alpinizm leadership training.
In this context, the department of a graduate-level
tourist guide in Turkey, Turkish Mountaineering
Federation’s Leadership in Alpinizm instructions;
should reorganise their curriculum according to
their knowledge, skills and competences. According
to the examination results, 29 pieces tourist guide
department located at the undergraduate level in
Turkey should be given to proposals for curriculum.

LITERATURE
Resource-centred Recreation Activities are
recreational activities that are performed in places
defined as rural open areas outside the boundaries
of the city, where people realise the resources offered
by nature and only nature without using any artificial
facilities for their recreational activities (Gül, 2014).
Examples of resource-based recreation activities
include Climbing, Orienteering, Expedition,
Hiking, Trekking, Camping, Mountain Biking and
the like. The resource-centred spaces used for these
activities are national parks, nature monuments,
nature conservation areas, nature parks, wildlife
development sites and wetlands. To explain
resource-centred recreation areas with a paragraph;
National Parks: According to IUCN
(International Union for Conservation of Nature),
are mainly natural and cultural areas devoted to
protecting the spiritual foundations of protection
and ecological processes of the region to defend
the environment and culture. National parks offer
scientific, educational and recreational opportunities
to their visitors, whose main objective is to preserve
the natural biological diversity and the ecological
structure below it and to support environmental
processes, to promote education and recreation.
(National Parks - Eurosai, 2019).
Natural Monument is all kinds of formation
caused by natural events. It is called natural
parts which have various
01 features and scientific
values reserved for the protection of a particular
natural monument which is a living feature with
its geological features and protected within the
principles of a national park. Examples from the
world; Devils Tower, Monument Valley, The Needles
(Wikipedia, 2019; Prezi, 2019).

Natural Conservation Area is natural areas which are essential in terms of science and education and are
primarily dedicated to the conservation of biological diversity and natural and related cultural resources,
including elite examples of natural phenomena that are rare or disappearing in ecosystems. Examples from
the world; Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes, Mt Athos, the Andros marine zone, Kekova (IUCN, 2019;
TÜKÇEV, 2019).
The Natural Park is a natural area with biological or landscape features designed to provide protection.
Parks focus their attention on the protection and preservation of flora and fauna. They may be terrestrial
or marine; they can be found in the mountains, the sea, the desert or any other geographically defined area
(Edukalife, 2019).
Wildlife Development Area is the area where prey and wild animals and wildlife are protected,
developed, and prey animals are placed, measures are taken to improve the habitat and hunting can be
performed within the framework of particular hunting plan when necessary (Milliparklar, 2019).
Wetlands are defined as natural or artificial, continuous or seasonal, fresh, bitter and salty, stagnant or
flowing water bodies, swamps, peatlands, and ponds with a depth of not more than six meters. Examples of
wetlands in the Mediterranean and surrounding areas are estuary, river delta, coastal lagoon, lake, swamp
and oasis, salty swamp, natural or artificial salt and dam lakes (Doğakorumaderneği, 2019).

Table 1 shows examples of the types of activities that can be performed within the resource-centred
recreation areas. Orienteering, Climbing, Hiking and Trekking, known as a resource-centred recreational
activity, are commonly referred to as Alpinism. Alpinism consists of a combination of two words as a
concept; Alpine-style. Alpinism, which means mountaineering in its original form, is used in the literature
as a synonym for mountaineering. Alpinism; small and fast teams, all kinds of physical and security needs
from the beginning to the end of the need to carry the load, carried out at one time (Karğı, 2010). However,
in the modern sense, Alpinism is more different than climbing to the top of a mountain or the face of a
rock (Mahruki, 1996: 11). In modern Alpinism, hiking, trekking, exploring and climbing and walking in
bouldering is a recreational activity performed in a combination of mixed techniques (Somuncu, 2004:
6). Alpinism tours are a type of adventure tourism which is applied in steep terrain and climate, requiring
specialised equipment, clothes and food, and dealing with risk, danger and wild nature (Weber, 2001; Hall
and Weiler, 1992; Gyimóthy and Mykletun, 2004; Buckley, 2006; Różycki and Dryglas 2014).

182

With the introduction of the Alpinism done as a
tourism activity, it is useful in spreading this sport,
and it is known that Turkey prohibited the release
of professionalism in the mountains begin with. For
example, it is stated that the legend of Noah’s Ark
on Mount Ararat gave him a mystical dimension
and created a tourism potential by emphasising
at least mystical importance in the international
mountaineering market. With the spread of Alpinism
to the mountains of the world, the tourism industry
develops, thus developing new transporters, guides
and similar businesses in the mountain regions,
and many sectors are cross-affected (Çakıcı, Yavuz
and Çiçek, 2014: 79). In this context, in Alpinism
activities, mentoring, guidance, leadership or
guidance has to be realised by one or more skilled
guides who accompany and manage the tour. In such
organisations, guides are responsible for the safety
of the participants and the logistics by solving any
problems that may occur. Besides, one of the main
tasks of the climbing and hiking tour is to explain
the nature of the participants (Leister, 2019: 1). As
defined, guided hiking and climbing tours consist
of various tangible and intangible components
that affect the experience and satisfaction of the
participants. These;
a) The organisation of the Alpinism Tour;
b) Quality of Infrastructure (Accommodation,
Food, Roads, Transportation);
c) The attractiveness of the Selected Route
(Landscapes, Tourist Sites, Area, Difficulty,
Season);
d) Environmental
Conditions
in
the
Organization Dates (Weather, Temperature,
Drought, Humidity, Flood);
e) Information provided to tourists before and
during the tour;
f) Knowledge and Skills

METHOD
The purpose of this study using more active in the
tourism sector’s resources based on recreational
areas with Turkey, to obtain more revenues from
tourism train human resources for the provision
of the necessary infrastructure. According to the
reports prepared by the world tourism organisation,
the income generated from the nature-based tourism
types is higher than mass tourism, and people’s

perception of tourism has changed entirely, and
the changing tourism perception caused different
recreational behaviours to create different demands
in the tourism field. In this context, the knowledge,
skills and competences given in the field of tourism
education are required according to the current
changes. Due to the high incomes obtained from
resource-based recreational activity-based tourism
movements, contributing to the effects of countries
on the balance of payments and giving importance
to the infrastructure studies to be made makes this
study significant.
In this study, the academic knowledge necessary
for Turkey Mountaineering Federation hiking
leadership, to apply the skills and competencies
in the curricula of tourist guides section of the 29
tourism faculties in Turkey, to determine the course
which is available balances and in this direction is
qualitative research was prepared to harmonise
the program. Secondary data were used as the
data collection method. In the OSYM’s Preference
Guide, published in 2019 for current tourism
guidance programs, 29 tourist guidance sections
that will be active in the 2019-2020 academic year
were examined. Examination of the curricula The
8-semester curricula used in the official web sites of
the faculties was utilised.

FINDINGS
The results obtained from the study conducted
within the scope of 29 tourism guidance departments
are given in Table 2. When Table 2 is examined, it
is determined that only 21 of the 29 departments
can access the curriculum on the web. As a result
of the examination, it was observed that only one
of the courses in tourism guidance departments had
five (5) classes consistent with the subjects of gait
leadership knowledge, skills and ability. It was found
that the three departments that were examined had
four (4) courses of gait leadership knowledge, skills
and ability. In the twelve of the tourist guidance
departments, only three (3) gait leadership were
found to be consistent with knowledge, skills and
ability. Four departments were found to be consistent
with two (2) gait leadership knowledge, skills
and competencies, and only one department was
consistent with one (1) gait leadership knowledge,
skills and ability.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The training of tourist guides is crucial to increase knowledge, skills and competences. In this context,
tourist guides should use leadership that can be defined to achieve goals by organising activities in a group
of people (Shooter, Sibthorp and Paisley, 2009). Leadership skills of the mentors include difficult skills
(first aid, navigation, how to do things, knowledge, physical abilities) and easy skills (communication,
empathy, determination, time management, flexibility). In this context, what are the needs of individuals
and societies and their source are the changes and developments in the fields of science, technology and art
that affect daily life.
For this reason, a good education is required for quality service in the global competitive environment
depending on individual and social progress. In this context, the curriculum for the people to be raised
should have a dynamic structure. In other words, the curriculum needs to be continuously transformed
according to the needs of the individual and society. Therefore, updating the curriculum is necessary for
qualified education. In the field of tourism guidance education, it is essential to determine the appropriate
methods and techniques using needs analysis and due diligence to prepare the curriculum according to the
needs of the individual, society and work area. In this context, it is useful to carry out a needs analysis to be
performed at the national level (Coşkun, 2017: 8).
The economic dimension of resource-centred tourism mobility is 3/1 of the total tourism income, which
is around 400 billion dollars annually. It is said that this study aims to make studies on the curriculums in the
field of Alpinism necessary. Mainly in the tourism curriculum of schools in Turkey, it is known to be just as
focused on mass tourism. In this context, their curricula should be reshaped according to changing human
preferences in tourism. In this respect, it is vital to provide training in tourist guidance undergraduate
programs within the framework of the knowledge, skills and competencies that Alpinism gait leaders should
have within the scope of the Laws, to contribute to professional specialisation. For this reason, it will be a
more scientific approach to include the changes seen in tourist consumption behaviours and the knowledge
of the programs prepared for tourism guidance education in the sub-branches of alpinism. 05.21.2016 date

Tourist guidance curricula should be rearranged
to enable students to get the gait leadership
certificate, and program development should be
done by evaluating the curricula according to
current consumer behaviour in tourism.

ABSTRACT

U

nconscious industrialization, the development of technology and the assumption that
natural resources are expendable have resulted in climate changes, ocean levels and
degradation of natural habitats over the last two decades. Countries began to take
measures to reduce these problems with the Stockholm Conference in 1972, and have taken
measures to protect the environment more actively since the 2000s. Since the 1970s, it has been
emphasized that every environmental initiative should be sustainable. The environment comes
first to mind when it comes to urban sustainability. For this reason, the concept of sustainability
is important in environmental and tourism-related issues. Economic and social sustainability
should also be taken into account in the protection of environmental health for sustainable cities.
More than fifty percent of the world’s population lives in cities. Cities, which are the main
source of environmental pollution, are the ones that consume non-renewable natural resources.
With urbanization, the depletion of natural resources accelerated due to the supply of nutrients, energy,
water, and other needs. The fact that melting glaciers as a result of climate change causes an increase
in ocean levels threatens the ocean and seacoast cities. For this reason, the concept of environmental
sustainability in cities has been one of the main issues of the last decade. The United Nations and the
United Arab Emirates have put forward important projects in the development of sustainable tourism
cities. In this study, it is aimed to reveal the perspectives of UN and UAE within the scope of sustainable
city, environmental protection and city tourism in the transition from environmentally damaging cities
to sustainable environment-friendly cities. As a method, two cross-sectional researches were carried out
in the literature which is an example for the variables.

ABSTRACT

T

he industrialization process has started the evolve fourth time with the new generation of
information and communication technologies. Internet of things, artificial ıntelligence,
sensors, cognitive technologies, nanotechnology, quantum computing, wearable technologies,
augmented reality, robots, big data, 3D and ıntelligent networks technologies are lead to the fourth
industrial revolution called as Industry 4.0. New generation technologies have started to change business
environments and lifestyles by using them rapidly in the fields of doing business, communication and
education. It is inevitable that smart cities will provide services through the official application (app) due
to gain competitive advantage and especially Z generation citizens actively using technology. In Turkey,
some cities have now started to serve through the official application. However, there are paucity of
studies on the services provided by the applications and the opinions of the users. Therefore, the aim of
the study is to examine the official applications of the first five major cities of Turkey (Istanbul, Ankara,
Izmir, Bursa, Antalya) and to give suggestions. According to the results, the most offered services are city
guide, wifi points, social facilities, public transport, pharmacies. When the comments of the five cities’
applications are evaluated in general, it can be said that the users mostly complain that the applications
are sometimes broken.

INTRODUCTION
While advances in technology have distorted all memorization, new concepts are placed in every area of
life. The concept of smart tourism has become widely used to processes that use all kinds of technology
applications that are developed with the human mind, augmenting human labor, which is the essential
element of production. Every word that has an smart title at the beginning shows that it is technology based.
In this context; smart cities can be defined as living spaces where new technologies are used to ensure the
effectiveness of the traditional services provided by the city administration to residents and foreigners.
There is no doubt that restructured sectors in technology-based cities will also be smart.
The concept of smart city emerges due to the complexity and management difficulties faced by the
authorities to cope with the rapid growth of the urban population. Harrison et al. (2010) defined “smart” as
using real-time and real-world data, integrating, sharing, and using analytics, modeling, and visualization
to make better operational decisions. This adjective has been added to cities (smart cities) to define efforts
to use innovative technologies to achieve resource optimization, effective and fair governance, sustainability
and quality of life (Gretzel et al., 2015).
Many problems started in the first years of the 20th century, such as population growth, traffic problems,
excessive consumption of natural resources and environmental pollution due to rapid urbanization, regional
development and economic incentives (Kim and Han, 2012). After the implementing the new generation
information technology to hospitals, railways, bridges, tunnels, roads, buildings, water systems, dams and
pipelines via Internet within the scope of smart cities by IBM firm in order to reduce these problems and
provide service to the citizens in the cities (Zhang, 2010) the concept of smart city has started to gain
importance. The concept of smart city refers to an environment in which technology integrates with the
city. This technology creates synergies with the social components of the city in order to improve the quality
of life of citizens and at the same time to reduce energy use and increase the efficiency
of city services such
01
as better traffic monitoring (Vicini et al., 2012).
Topsakal et al. (2018) conducted a smart tourism and smart city study, which describes the application
of smart city concept and technologies in the context of tourism. In their studies on smart tourism
destinations, Topsakal and Çelik (2017) stated that smart cities also increase tourism competitive advantage.
Focusing on the functionality and adoption of smartphone applications, Topsakal (2018) stated that local
administrations provide numerous benefits to their citizens through smart applications. It is inevitable

187

that smart cities provide competitive advantage and
serve cities through official application. In Turkey,
some cities have now started to serve through the
official application. However, there are paucity
studies on the services provided by the applications
and the opinions of the users. Therefore, the aim of
the study is to examine the official applications of the
first five major cities of Turkey (Istanbul, Ankara,
Izmir, Bursa, Antalya) and to give suggestions.

SMART CITY AND SMART
TOURISM
The concept of smart city has evolved with a
technology-centric evolution based on the Internet,
mobile services, wireless sensor networks (WSN),
smart technologies and the Internet of Things
(Monathy et al., 2016). Cities such as Seattle,
Singapore, Montreal, Santiago, Amsterdam and
Casablanca have attempted to position themselves as
smart cities (Khomsi and Bedard, 2016). According
to Komninos (2002) a smart city should solve the
problems in that city by using Information and
Communication Technology (ICT). Smart cities;

and the quality of the workplace.

region to promote innovation, learning and
knowledge transfer.
Harrison et al. (2010) stated that a smart
city interconnects physical infrastructure, ICT
infrastructure, social infrastructure and business
infrastructure. Piro et al. (2014) defined smart
city as an urban environment supported by a
widespread ICT system and stated that smart cities
can provide advanced and innovative services to
citizens in order to improve the quality of life. Boes
et al. (2015) suggested that the technologies used in
smart tourism destinations are different from those
used in smart cities. For example, the authors state
that tourists use technology before, during and after
travel; but it is limited to the use of technology in a
smart city.
Giffinger (2007) developed a model to
determine the scope of the smart city. Giffinger’s
work was followed by other models defining the
dimensions of the smart city (Anthopoulos, 2015).
Cohen (2012) identified six dimensions that should
be considered in smart cities. These dimensions can
be explained as above (Cohen, 2012):

188

t 4NBSU &OWŔSPONFOU 3FGFST UP SFOFXBCMF
energy sources, ICT supported energy
networks, measurement, pollution control
and monitoring, renewal of buildings
and facilities, green buildings, green city
planning, energy efficiency, reuse and
resource substitution. City services such as
street lighting, pollution reduction, drainage
systems and water resources should be
monitored by smart city system, pollution
should be reduced and water quality should
be improved.
t 4NBSU -ŔWŔOH 3FGFST UP *$5 TVQQPSUFE
lifestyles, behavior and consumption. Smart
living is also linked to high levels of social
cohesion and social capital. Smart living
offers healthy and safe living in a lively city
with cultural diversity and quality housing
and accommodation.

city has ICT-supported transportation and
logistics systems. For example; it should
cover sustainable, safe and interconnected
transport systems and integrate modes of
transport (tram, bus, train, subway, car,

e-business, ICT-integrated and advanced

Union means a combination of urban and
inter-city governance, including services
and interactions that integrate effectively
and efficiently as an organism. The key
facilitating tool to achieve this is ICT, which
is provided by data, intelligent processes and
interoperability. Smart city can be defined as
a globally networked hub with international,
national and hinterland connections. Smart
objects include transparency and open data by
using ICT and e-government in participatory
decision-making and co-created e-services.

with ICT support, have e-skills, have
access to education and training, know
human resource management and capacity
management, develop creativity and promote
innovation.

European Union has defined a roadmap of smart cities, and create interconnecting human capital,
social capital and ICTs for more sustainable economic development and better quality of life based on
thisroad map (Manville et al. 2014).
The focus of smart cities is the citizens of the city, however smart tourism destinations focus on improving
the tourist experience (Figueredo, 2018). In a similar way, Lamsfus and Alzua-Sorzabal (2013) stated that
smart city approach focuses on citizens, does not include visitors, and smart destination approach includes
tourists and passengers. Wang et al. (2016) provides a conceptual model for smart tourism destinations.
According to this model; the basis of the concept of smart tourism destination is an inclusive ‘service’ logic
that directs the design and operation of the destination. The physical characteristics (sources) of smart
tourism destinations and the technological state of smart tourism destinations (in terms of cloud computing,
Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and mobile communication) shaped the demand for ‘new’ tourists
(Wang et al., 2016). Lamsfus et al. (2015) similarly stated that smart tourism destinations help to develop
new services in the tourism industry. For example, smart phones that emerged with the mobile industry
have changed the tourism experience and moved the travel and tourism sectors to advanced service areas
(Lamsfus et al., 2015). Destination management organizations can spread tourists to a wider area instead
of concentrating at certain points. This improves the experience of individual tourists, provides access to
a wider set of services, and attracts more tourists and motivates them to stay in destinations for longer
(Kramer et al., 2008).
Buhalis and Amaranggana (2014) note that smart tourism destinations require dynamically
interconnected stakeholders through technological platforms to gather, create and exchange information
that can be used to enrich tourism experiences in real-time. Interconnected tourism organizations provide
real-time and personalized services to tourists and also collect data for the optimization of strategic and
operational management (Wang et al., 2013). Destination management organizations work as a ‘smart
center’ that collects and distributes all the information about destinations, thus providing a competitive
advantage over competitors.

METHOD
Case study, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the study. Qualitative research is defined
as a study in which qualitative data collection techniques such as observation, interview and document
analysis are used, and a qualitative process is carried out to present perceptions and events in a realistic and
holistic manner in the natural environment (Yıldırım and Şimşek, 2008). According to Creswell (2007) it
is a qualitative research approach in which the researcher deeply examines one or more situations in time
by means of data collection tools (observations, interviews, audiovisuals, documents, reports) containing
multiple sources, identifying situations and related themes. In this context, the official applications of
Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa and Antalya Metropolitan Municipality have been downloaded to the smart
phone and examined in detail. A word cloud was made through edwordle.net about the fields that five
applications serve. Then, the user comments (from IOS and Andorid) given about these applications were
examined by content analysis and negative opinions of the users were revealed.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
The industrial revolution that emerged in the 1800s has evolved three times with new technologies and
innovations that have evolved over the years, and today for the fourth time, has started to evolve again
under the name Industry 4.0. Although the first revolutions were developed primarily for wars, they have
found application in every industry over time. However, Industry 4.0 and new generation technologies
have directly affected all sectors and technology is now the key to competition. Cities have also begun to
adapt to Industry 4.0 technologies. For this purpose, cities have started to serve the citizens with smart
applications. Some cities in Turkey have developed smart applications and started to provide some services
through these applications. The applications of Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa and Antalya Metropolitan
Municipalities were examined. Considering the results, the following recommendations were given;

ABSTRACT

T

here are few studies investigated the relationship among trust, satisfaction, and loyalty together
in the literature in terms of web-based travel intermediaries. The main aim of this study is to
investigate the factors such as trust and satisfaction creating customer loyalty in web-based
travel intermediaries. It was explored the degree of importance of trust, besides satisfaction, when it
is associated with loyalty. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationship among web
based travel intermediary loyalty, satisfaction and trust. The research was conducted between February
and April 2018 in Istanbul. Total of 362 data were collected by questionaires and analyzed. The results
indicated that participants’ satisfaction and trust predicted web-based travel intermediary loyalty at
68.9% level. Accordingly, satisfaction and trust seems to have a significant and positive affect on the
web-based travel intermediary loyalty. The results provide evidence that trust is a strong influence on
customer loyalty as well as satisfaction.
Keywords: E-trust, E-satisfaction, E-loyalty, Web based travel intermediaries.

INTRODUCTION
Internet has occurred as a new distribution channel and marketing medium in tourism and travel
industry since mid-1990s (Xiang et al., 2015: 246). According to reports of 2017, in the world, the
number of internet users reached 3,578 billion, the number of mobile phone users reached 4,68 billion,
and the number of smartphones users reached 2,1 billion (Statista, 2018). These technologies have played
a critical role both in the competitiveness of tourism organizations and in the experience of tourists.
Internet and other information technologies have changed customer behavior. Nowadays, almost all of
travel information searches, reservations and payments are done online and during the preparation stage
of a trip (Huang et al., 2017).
With the commercializing of the internet, a great transformation and unique chances emerged for
travel and tourism industry and this process changed the tourists’ behaviour in some ways. B2B (businessto-business) and B2C (business-to-customer) relationships were made more interactive and viable for
travel-related companies. One of the most important transformations was the formation of an original
and high-powered distribution and communication channel in that process filled up the gap between the
customers and the travel intermediaries. After establishing a new distribution channel (internet), those
travel intermediaries found a new way to reach their customers, and through this new way, they have
started to make much more profits. In the terms of customers; lower prices, markdowns and time savings
were the positive outcomes of this process (Amaro and Duarte, 2015).
For the web-based travel intermediaries, internet has also negative effects such as online pricing
transparency, price competition, high risk perception and lack of confidence which make customers less
01 are a lot of alternatives
loyal to web based travel intermediaries (Wen, 2009: 759). Additionally, there
for online customers and they have a great amount of knowledge. Online customer behaviour is more
changeable and the switching costs are lower in online world (Lopez-Miguens and Vázquez, 2017: 398
). The reasons why loyalty is of great importance for companies can be summed up as followings: Loyal
customers can increase the income of a company; they might buy more additional products and services
and they can create new businesses for the company through word-of-mouth advices. Loyal customers

can also help reducing costs because dealing with
them is probably less costly, and the costs of sales
or marketing and set-up can be amortised more
easily by the companies. A sustainable competitive
advantage can be provided by customer loyalty for
the companies over time. Loyalty is the key factor
for success and also companies can not survive
without creating a loyal customer source (Pamies,
2012: 1257).
Even so strategies on loyalty are important for
all sectors, it can be accepted that it is more suited
to service sector, especially because they offer more
opportunities to improve loyalty due to their nature.
The concept of loyalty has become even more
important for tourism-based companies selling
touristic products or services which are defined as
abstract, experiential, imperishable and operating
in the service sector. As a reason of that it should
be better understood by companies the key factors
developing customer loyalty, but there is few studies
about those mechanism creating customer loyalty
in the literature in the terms of online transactions
(Pamies, 2012: 1259).
Satisfaction and trust are two popular factors
investigated extensively by researchers because
of their impact on repurchase (Kim, 2012: 220;
Chiu et al., 2013: 284). According to the results
of previous studies (Kumar et al., 2013; Gommans
et al. 2001; Özdemir et al., 2012; Bhattacherjee,
2001; Aldas-Manzano et al., 2011; Anderson
and Srinivasan, 2003; Srinivasan et al., 2002;
Balabanis et al., 2006; Floh and Treiblmaier, 2006;
Casalo et al., 2008; Gummerus et al., 2004; Kim
et al., 2009; Liang and Chen, 2009; Reichheld and
Schefter, 2000; Aldas-Manzano et al., 2011; Sahin
et al., 2011); there is a very strong relationship
between loyalty and satisfaction, but as they
stressed that satisfaction could not be translated
as loyalty in any cases, even though most loyal
customers emerge from satisfied ones.
In the literature, few studies have investigated
the relationship among trust, satisfaction, and
loyalty together in terms of web-based travel
intermediaries. Therefore, the main purpose of this
study is to examine the factors such as trust and
satisfaction creating customer loyalty in web-based
travel intermediaries. It was explored the degree of
importance of trust, besides satisfaction, when it
is associated with loyalty. Istanbul -one of Turkey’s
most important and biggest tourism destinationwas chosen for field research. Data were collected on
the basis of volunteerism from international tourists
visiting Istanbul via web-based travel intermediaries.
Research was carried out in February-April period
of 2018. 362 questionnaires were collected. The

196

results of regression analysis shows that trust and
satisfaction affect positively and significantly the
web-based travel intermediary loyalty.

LITERATURE REVIEW
E-trust is defined as “An attitude of confident
expectation in an online situation of risk that one’s
vulnerabilities will not be exploited” (Beldad et
al., 2010; Corritore et al., 2003). E-trust, according
to another definition, is to trust that company in
relation to its commercial activities in the electronic
environment, especially the website (Shankar et
al., 2002; Beldad et al., 2010). Whereas the former
definition applies to online interactions commonly,
the latter is more adjusted to trying to understand
e-trust in the circumstances of electronic commerce
exchanges (Beldad et al., 2010: 860).
Loyalty is defined as a positive attitude towards
business and repetitive buying behavior (Dick
and Basu, 1994). In order to be able to talk about
loyalty, positive attitudes developed by the customer
towards the brand should lead the customer to repurchase behavior (Keller, 1993). Customer loyalty
is recognized as an important factor which provides
long-term profitability for businesses (Ribbink et
al., 2004). It has been seen that a real loyal customer
has a committedness and adherence towards the
retailer and does not leave the retailer when a more
attractive alternative emerged (Shankar et al., 2003).
The importance of online trust is increased by the
lack of physical contact with online companies
and the lack of touch inherent in online shopping.
The important nature of online trust is accepted
not only by buyers and suppliers, but also by
lawmakers and those concerned about the erosion
of constitutional rights. While Stewart (2003)
suggests a strong relationship between trust and
purchasing, Sirdeshmukh et al. (2002) positions
trust in direct relation to loyalty. The link between
customers’ trust in a brand and brand loyalty was
investigated by Lau and Lee (1999), and they found
a significant positive relationship. Chaudhuri and
Holbrook (2001) extented these approaches and
they had a strong evidence to support the important
relationship between brand trust and purchasing
and commitment.
Alhabeeb (2007) describes the dynamic
relationship between customer trust and product
loyalty and investigates the mechanism by which
these structures are formed. According to findings
of their study; the last forming of product loyalty
is governed not only by the change between trust
and trustworthy, but also by the customer’s sense
of trustworthiness, the desire to broaden the range

of self-esteem and appreciation of experience and
satisfaction. These effects are particularly high if
they are collected at the country level and data
from participation is used. At the individual level,
especially in the parliament, trust increases the
likelihood of voting. Husain (2017) worked for
understanding the impact of trust and satisfaction
for customers in a developing country as the
priorities of behavioral and attitudinal loyalty. The
findings of the study show that trust and satisfaction
are a strong positive effect on behavioral and
attitudinal loyalty.
Satisfaction is found to be a strong positive
relationship with trust, as well. Chinomona and
Dubihlela (2014) have noted that although the
number of studies on customer behavior has
been increasing, studies on customer satisfaction,
loyalty and the intention to repurchase have not
been very successful in the context of African
retailing. Therefore, the study, which examines these
relations in South Africa retailing context, shows
that as a result, the relationship between customer
satisfaction and trust, customer satisfaction and
loyalty, customer loyalty and repurchase intention
and customer trust and repurchase intention
are significant and positive. Kumar et al. (2013)
investigate the direct relationship between
satisfaction and loyalty (direction, shape, explained
variance) and then examines the moderators,
mediators, and other determinants of loyalty.
According to the findings of the study, customer
satisfaction impacts positively on loyalty, but just
satisfaction explaines the variance in quite small
rate. Jambulingam et al. (2011) investigates the role
of trust as a management mechanism in relation to
justice and loyalty under different interdependence
structures between suppliers (wholesalers) and
buyers (retailers). The findings of the study show
that trust as a management mechanism under the
conditions of symmetrical independence is entirely
mediated by the link between justice and loyalty.
However, under the conditions of both perceived
independence (ie lack of interdependence) and
asymmetric recipient dependence, trust does not
play an intermediary role but directly affects loyalty.
Sahin et al. (2011) tested an overall framework for
establishing a customer-brand relationship from an
experiential point of view. The findings showed that
brand satisfaction is a very positive effect on brand
loyalty. Also, brand trust is an important influence
on brand loyalty. Lau and Lee (1999) suggests
three factors that affect the confidence in a brand.
These three factors correspond to the three entities
involved in the brand-customer relationship: The
company behind the brand, the customer interacting
with the brand and the brand itself. At the same

time, it is also advised that trust in a brand will lead
to brand loyalty. Last of all, the findings of the study
reveal that the influence of a customer of brand
characteristics on brand trust is important. It also
shows that trust in a brand has a positive association
with brand loyalty. With respect to Paulssen et al.
(2014), commercial-customer relations between an
auto brand and its customers are being investigated
by applying structural equation modeling. The
findings of the study show that brand satisfaction
determines brand loyalty when the perceived risk
is low, while brand trust determines brand loyalty
alone when perceived risk is high.
Harris and Goode (2004) centered the loyalty
and trust in the context of retailing. They found
out that there is a meaningful relationship between
trust and loyalty, trust and satisfaction but it has
not reached a clear conclusion on the nature of
relationship between satisfaction and loyalty.
Büyükdağ and Kitapçı (2017) have investigated
whether there is a moderate effect over the
relationship between internet experience level,
e-satisfaction and e-loyalty. According to the
findings of the study, customers who have low
internet experience show more e-loyalty than those
who have high internet experience. It also shows that
e-satisfaction significantly effects e-loyalty. Yaşın
et al. (2017) worked on the factors that influence
customers shopping online loyalty (e-loyalty) to
e-retail sites. As a result of that study, it has been
found that there is a direct effect of satisfaction with
the service of the relevant site and their trust on the
site, while indirect effects of quality of web site they
percieved via electronic trust and satisfaction in the
developing process of customer loyalty to the online
retail shopping site. The quality of the web site that
they perceive, besides customers’ trust on that web
site, is an important determinant in the formation of
the customer satisfaction of the e-retail site
Kassim and Abdullah (2010) empirically
investigate the relations of perceived quality of
service, satisfaction, trust and loyalty in e-commerce
environments in two cultures such as Malaysia and
Qatar. According to the findings of the study, the
perceived service quality is an important effect on
customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is a
critical influence on trust, as well. Both customer
satisfaction and trust has significantly impact on
loyalty. Aldas-Manzano et al. (2011) analyze the role
01
of satisfaction, trust, frequency
of use and perceived
risk as the ancedents of loyalty towards customers’
e-banking sites. The results of the study show that
the individual is closely linked to the level of trust
and perceived risk of loyalty to a banking website.
Also satisfaction has a positive relationship with
loyalty.

Bozbay et al. (2017) examined the relationship
among e-trust, e-loyalty, and electronic word-ofmouth communication for e-shopping sites of
social media users. The findings of the research
revealed that there is a meaningful relationship
between e-trust, e-commitment and electronic
word-of-mouth communication. In addition;
according to the socio-demographic characteristics
of social media users, electronic trust, e-loyalty and
electronic word-of-mouth communication differ.
Özdemir et al. (2012) added new informations
to knowledge accumulation in the field of target
management and marketing by providing a better
understanding of the relationship between tourist
profile, satisfaction and loyalty. According to the
findings of the study, there are significant relations
between tourist profile, satisfaction and loyalty
and they imply strongly support that there is a
meaningful relationship between tourist satisfaction
and loyalty to the destination. Pesämaa et al. (2007)
presented a model that suggests loyalty among
tourism companies. This model has been developed
on the assumption of a well-defined partner and
shared expectation and experience trust. According
to the findings of the study; trust is an important
and powerful indicator of loyalty.
Martinez and Bosque (2013) set forth an
impact model, showing the direct and indirect
impacts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on
hotel customer loyalty, including trust, customer
identification with the company, and satisfaction
as a mediator. According to the findings; customer
trust will positively influence on customer loyalty
and customer satisfaction will positively influence
on customer loyalty. Kim et al. (2011) to examine
the factors affecting trust, satisfaction and loyalty.
It is set forward that navigation functionality and
perceived security have a significant positive effect
on trust by results of the study. According to the
findings; customer satisfaction impacts trust, which
renders a critical duty as a premise of customer
loyalty in online shopping for tourism products and
services.
Kim et al. (2012) found that perceived security,
web site features, and navigational functionality have
a significant and positive effect on trustworthiness.
Moreover, loyalty has strengthened the relationship
between perceived security, web site features,
navigation functionality and trust. Flavian et al.
(2006) set forth that to determine the effect of
percieved user availability on the websites visited
by users, perceived usability of system increases the
level of loyalty to the web site, user’s trust increases
as well. Also, greater usability was found to have a
positive effect on user satisfaction, which in turn
positively affected website loyalty. Finally, user trust
198

is found to be partially. Loureiro and González
(2008) examined that satisfaction is associate with
trust and as a result, between satisfaction and trust,
trust and loyalty, there is a positive relationship.
According to the study; the effect of trust on
satisfaction is higher than on loyalty. The study,
developed by Pamies (2003), shows that trust has
a positive effect on customer loyalty in retail travel
agencies in Spain.
The following hypothesis has been developed
and tested in accordance with the literature
summary given above.
H1: Percieved Satisfaction significantly effect
percieved web-based travel intermediary
loyalty
H2: Percieved Trust significantly effect percieved
web-based travel intermediary loyalty.

METHODOLOGY
In this study, we aimed to investigate the factors
such as trust and satisfaction creating customer
loyalty in web-based travel intermediaries. It was
explored the degree of importance of trust, besides
satisfaction, when it is associated with loyalty.
Multiple Linear regression was used to examine the
relationship among web based travel intermediary
loyalty, satisfaction and trust.
Owing to investigation the relationship among
web-based travel intermediary loyalty, satisfaction
and trust, this study can be considered as a
descriptive study. Within the scope of the research;
tourists visiting İstanbul through web-based travel
intermediaries were included. The convenience
sampling method which is nonprobability sampling.
The research was conducted between February and
April 2018 in Istanbul. Istanbul was chosen because
it is one of the most biggest destination visiting by
tourists who use web-based travel intermediaries in
Turkey. 381 data were collected from participants
and after missing data were extracted, a total of 362
data were analyzed.
Survey form was employed as data collection
tool in the research. The survey form included
demographic questions and scales of trust,
satisfaction and loyalty. For measuring the trust, the
scale used for the study of Kim (2005) was utilized.
For measuring satisfaction and loyalty; the scale of
Yap et al. (2012) was used. A 7-point Likert-type
scale (1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree)
was used.
As a result of the preliminary examinations,
questionnaires with missing and unsuitable data
were extracted for analyses. One of the methods

for analyzing the data set is extreme value analyses. Finally, extreme values were checked. For univariate
extreme values for dependent and independent variables, a significant Z table value of 0.01 was checked in
ascending or descending order, and extreme values were extracted from the data set. Cook’s distance was
investigated for multivariable extreme values and no value was found above 1. (Tabachnick ve Fidell, 2007).
Before the data was analyzed, it was examined whether the data corresponded to the normal distribution.
Since the values of skewness and kurtosis are between -1.5 and +1.5, the data were considered to be normally
distributed. (Tabachnick ve Fidell, 2013).
First, the validity and reliability analyses of the measurement tools were made. Validity and reliability
are the most basic features needed to be found in a measurement. Reliability is the degree to which measures
are independent of error. The most widely used criterion for reliability of the scale is the Cronbach Alpha
internal consistency value.

Cronbach Alpha values (α), which indicates the reliability coefficient of all scales used in the research,
are above 0.70 (Nunnally, 1970). As a result; the measurement tools and dimensions used in the research
questionnaire appear to provide internal consistency measures. (Tablo 1). Confirmatory factor analysis was
used to test the construct validity of the measurement tools. Standardized parameter values, T values, of
the measurement model are given in Table 1. The parameter estimates belonging to the model are included
in the table and the factor weights are calculated as the coefficient estimates standardized according to the
maximum likelihood method. All the coefficients were found to be significant in the order of 0.01. The
compliance indexes of the model are shown collectively in Table.1. These findings show that the expressions
are correctly explained by the factors and can be regarded as proof of construct validity of the scales.
For the convergence validity, Fornell and Larcker (1981) calculated item reliability, construct reliability
and average variance extracted. Composite reliability is the main measure used in the measurement model.
The composite reliability calculated for each dimension is shown in Table 01
2.1. All values are above the
acceptable limit of 0.70 (Hair et al., 1998; Nunally, 1978). One of the indicators of convergence validity is the
average variance extracted (AVE) ratio. This value is expected to be equal to or higher than 0.50 (Bagozzi et
al., 1991). In this study, all AVE values were over 0.50.

RESULTS
In this section, descriptive statistics and the outcomes of the analysis from testing hypotheses for the
purpose of the research are given. 51.4% (186) of participants were male and 48.6% (176) were female.
41% (93) were aged between 18 and 24 years, 35.1% (127) were 25-31 years, 19.6% (71) were 32-38 years,
9.1% 45 years, 4.1% (15) 46-52 years, 6.4% (23) 53 years and above. The total number of customers’ years
of usage of web-based travel intermediaries consist of 46.1% (167) for 1-5 years, 39.2% (142) for 5-10 years,
12.7% (46), 1.9% (7) for 16-20 years. When the web-based travel intermediaries five most frequently used
by participants were examined: 35.36% (128) booking.com, 17.96% (65) expedia.com, 13.54% (49) airbnb.
com (28) skyscanner.com, 3,87% (14) trivago.com.
The mean, standard deviation and correlation coefficients for the variables are given in the table 2. The
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), which investigates the correlation between independent variables before
the regression test, was examined. This factor was well below the grade value of 10, and the tolerance
statistics were well above the limit value (1-R2) of 0.309 (Satisfaction tolerance value= 0.777; Trust tolerance
value = 0.777). That is, there is no perfect linear relationship between predictor variables, each variable
explains the different dimensions of the variance and the results of the regression analyzes are significant.

Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine to what extent satisfaction and trust
determines loyalty to web-based travel intermediaries. The results of multiple linear regression analysis
were statistically significant. F= 400.753, P<0.05. The value of R2 is 0.691 (table 3). This result tells us
that 69.1% of loyalty on the web-based travel intermediary depends on independent variables. The value
of Adjusted R2 is 0.689. This result shows that the variance of 68.9% of loyalty on the web-based travel
intermediary is predicted by trust and satisfaction.

*P < 0.05
** P < 0.001

When Beta coefficients in the table were examined, after all of the independent variables were
introduced into the regression model, there was a significant “trust” (β = 0.074, p <0.05) and “satisfaction”
(β = 0.79.3, P<0.001) contribution in explaining web based travel intermediary loyalty. According to there
results; it can be said that the significance order of the independent variables on the dependent variable is
“satisfaction” (β =0.79.3, P<0.001) and “Trust” (β =0.074, P<0.05). It is seen that “satisfaction” (β=0.79,3) is
a very important factor affecting web based travel intermediary loyalty. The relationship between trust (β=
0.074) and web-based travel intermediary loyalty is relatively low. This means that one standard deviation
increased in trust will lead to a 0.074 standard deviation increase in web-based travel intermediary loyalty

200

when other variables are under control. According to these results; Hypotesis H1 and H2 were accepted.
Regression analysis shows that trust and satisfaction affect positively and significantly the web-based travel
intermediary loyalty. Therefore, hypothesis, percieved trust and percieved satisfaction significantly effect
percieved web-based travel intermediary loyalty was supported by this study.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this study, the effect of trust and satisfaction on the loyalty of tourists using web based travel intermediaries
was examined. The results of the analysis provide evidence that trust is a strong influence on customer
loyalty as well as satisfaction. Trust and satisfaction are the terms that describe the relationship between
the suppliers and customers in the world of e-commerce. In this study, inter-variable relationships were
set forth by using linear regression and we found out that participants’ satisfaction and trust predicted
web-based travel intermediary loyalty at 68.9% level. Accordingly, satisfaction and trust seems to have a
significant and positive affect on the web-based travel intermediary loyalty. This is in line with the results of
previous studies (Moriuchi and Takahashi, 2016; Pamies, 2012; Şahin et al., 2011; Husain, 2017; Martínez
and Bosque, 2013), and they have stressed the importance of achieving customer trust in e-commerce,
beside satisfaction. In the light of the findings of this research, It can be recommended that web-based
travel intermediaries should effort to obtain their customers’ trust if they want to reduce the negative effects
of internet on customer loyalty. Thus they can easily create a loyal customer source for stability and success
under intense competition conditions.
This study conducted on tourists who visited Istanbul through the web-based travel intermediaries.
Therefore, the results of this study limit the generalization. In order to obtain generalizable results, it is
suggested to test in different samples. For further studies, different variables can be added to first model
which is not included in the scope of this study, such as service quality, website features etc. In additon,
researches can add “information quality” as an other cognition based trust antecedent and “reputation”,
“feedback of buyers”, “word-of-mouth” as other affect-based trust antecedents to hierarcical regression
models to explain different dimensions of variance in trust in web based travel intermediaries. Moreover,
alternative models can be proposed to understand the relationships between the structure in first model
studied in our work. For example, trust can be positioned as a moderator of the relationship between
satisfaction and loyalty.

Dehumanizing Tourism and the Despair
Atilla YÜKSEL

ABSTRACT

T

ourism is an evolved form of colonization, an agent invented to control the economies of
developing countries, and a means of terrorism with high economic, social, ecological and
cultural destructive power. This paper likes to ask three simple questions to those who are happy
to see their town among the most visited towns: “Do you know how many dollars did you spend to make
1$ income in tourism?”; “What goods/services did you have to import for investment in tourism?” and
“What is the difference between the zoo and the locals whose lives are mortgaged for tourism and whose
fates are trapped for the taste and gaze of tourists?”

INTRODUCTION
Considering the growing annual volume of international tourist arrivals, the generated total revenue and
the jobs, it is not surprising to witness that governments worldwide take tourism as a panacea to remedy
economic bottlenecks. But, despite its so-called window-dressed benefits, along with ceaseless goodwill
statements and biased claims of politicians and authorities, tourism destinations, particularly in developing
countries, by and large still continue to face with one of these three problems, characterizing classical
mentality of tourism development: That is;
i.

either large foreign capital purchases domestic capital resulting in a change in the status of ownership
and hence the attractiveness of locality (e.g., naturalness, localness, heritage etc.) is destroyed for the
sake of urbanization and rapid economic returns;
ii. employees are kept underqualified, sometimes consciously, and customers are therefore unhappy
due to low quality of services and products, resulting in an increase in bargaining power of tour
operators intimidating locals with shifting their operations to another cost-effective destination; or
iii. that local people are marginalized or excluded from the economy resulting in income leakages
outside the economy fueling community resentment. This “dehumanizing” nature, with a very
narrow biased economic perspective, is notoriously obsessive for creating an “open museum” in
which wealthy and bourgeois visitors enjoy their time while staying oblivious to the real problems of
those who are kept in the social prison against their free will.
Thus far several adverse consequential aspects of tourism development have been studied, including
environmental, economic and socio-cultural. More specifically, tourism and its generally overlooked
negative consequences on locals, limited exchanges between hosts and the visitors akin to master-slave
relationships, rising visitor numbers and diminishing carrying capacities of destinations, as well as,
environmental degradations, social segregations resulting from overtourism, etc., have been much debated
and well documented. However, the individual well-being (i.e., what tourism really triggers in physical,
mental and spiritual states of individuals e.g., holiday makers, locals, employees) has not been deservedly
taken on board. Not surprisingly, voices continue to rise from different parts of the world echoing that
tourism makes life miserable, particularly for residents and locals as employees:

Classical tourism, driven by capitalistic greediness, has reached a point where tourism has become
related to “objects only”, not to the individuals nor to their life. Several dehumanizing examples can be listed.
For example, many men from the western world, aiming to have an opportunity of “good time”, continues
to flock into Asian destinations to choose under-aged Asian girls, who is even unable to make any verbal
communication, for sex encounters and all human related attributes such as names, values, family history

204

are not being exchanged in these encounters. Lives
of Asians are ruined because all tourists, without any
exception, want to feel like a hu“man.” Hence it would
not be wrong to claim that tourism in most of the cases
deprives people of positive human qualities, as broad
range of indignities exist. Subtle (looks, gestures, tone
of voice, disrespect to local customs, patronizing
interactions etc.) or brutal forms of dehumanization
occur not only when one group of people (tourists)
see others as objects not human, but also when the
powerful (tourists) take the very humaneness of
others by trying to manage their economic and social
relations. Arguing that classical form of tourism and
dehumanization stand to be the two sides of the same
coin should not be an overstatement.
Very recently a new concept, humanistic tourism
has emerged from the ruins and mist of the mistakes,
cultural discourses of classical tourism and it has
gently reminded us of we must return being “human”
again. From my point of view humanistic tourism
should indeed defend human dignity in the face of
its vulnerability. To defend human dignity means
to respect for human freedom and be against the
instrumentalization of human beings into human
capital and mere means for profits. In this respect,
humanistic tourism seems to hold a potential as an
experiential tourism activity including characteristics
of both conventional tourism and its own unique
characteristics, particularly the morale aspects
with an aim to help people fulfill their potential
and maximize their well-being. Some view this
new concept as “a revolutionary way of reducing the
negative impacts of tourism and takes into account the
relationship between hosts and guests as based on the
tourist experience” (Bizzari, 2016, p. 110.).
From these flimsy attempts; however, there
arises four intriguing questions.
i. Why now, all of a sudden, the tourism industry
seems to have started to be concerned with
morale issues and spiritual world of tourists?
ii. How so-called “humanism”, a popular
recent movement, will bind up the wounds
stemmed from the destructive structure of
classical tourism which continues to flourish
despite the suffrages (hosts sufferings from
pollutions, crowds, environmental problems,
segregations etc.)?
iii. What are the most important features that
separate humanistic tourists and humanistic
tourism, offered as a new commodity to
consume, from other types?
iv. Will tourism investors control their
economical and ideological urges and change
their attitudes and behaviors at a short notice?

I believe the search for new concepts in
tourism (humanistic, exotic, erotic, ecotic, artic…)
is kind of a game, researchers, marketers, tourist
authorities have been playing somewhat for serving
capitalistic desires. But not all games are harmless!
The consequences of participating in that game
and believing that humanistic tourism etc., is the
exact saver or it is the ultimate remedy will be
disputable. Taking narrow and biased perspectives,
grand narratives and centralized theories of
classical tourism and insisting that this is what it is
to be humanistic, this theory is what it is to explain
humanistic tourism best and this method of analysis
will tell us what it is to be the humanistic effect will
be a fruitless loss of time unless dehumanizing
nature of tourism is recognized, better understood
and accepted. The continuation of the production
of special types to fragment tourism may turn into
an important obstacle that prevents us from seeing
the big picture in the tourism industry. First and
foremost, tourism can no longer be a specialized
consumer product or a consumption type. Tourism
has long changed from being a mortal and a short
ritual to a modality through which ever-increasing
modern life is being organized. It is thus time for us
to perceive tourism as a global social life experience
rather than being seen as the behavior of those who
are far away from home. Secondly, there exists a
fatal desire to exoticize and eroticize tourism but the
current tourism research cannot go beyond “what
other people do in situations away from home”.
Consequently it produces nothing but “formalized
gossips.” Third, humanistic movement may
mistakenly be seen akin to another type of nomadism.
Humanistic tourism cannot be nomadism but it can
be viewed as a migration site for modern nomads.
This tourism movement is not just about leaving
and going back to where it is departed, but it is a the
very mixed emotions, such as being homesick and
yet yearning for a new home, missing the new life
on the way back to home. Fourth, the current state
of “masculinity in how we see the world around us”
is another major issue. Almost everything, which is
being subject of tourism and tourism research is the
produce of the man’s world. If this gendered issue is
the case, how can we talk about humanism? Tourism
at present can be liken to an open museum, in which
all the feminine subjects and objects are thought,
designed, transformed and exhibited to serve the
men, in response to the
01quest for devouring desire
of masculinity: “to give pleasure to man”. Neither
the tourists traveling nor the tourism researchers
have any domestic responsibilities as in the case of
so-called man’s everyday mentality. There is a rising
need for a non-gendered perspective that senses and
embraces the new concepts, social happenings, free

205

will, self-actualisation etc., tenderly before anyone
starts competing with one another. It is high time to
move away a bit from the men domination in viewing
the tourism world. Fifth, the idea that humanistic
tourism should be purely visual is a great mistake,
wrongly assuming that the humanistic individual
almost always has subjective freedom. That is, it is
wrong to believe that humanistic tourism is just a
subjective world in which the tourists would like
to see the artificial structure created for seeing.
The humanistic tourists is in pursuit of a return to
the essence, to the self, and look at things with a
second eye, immerse in the details of the daily life
of the unimportant matters rather than the details
of the artificial structure erected for the tourist
business. Hence humanistic tourism is not just
the consumption of visual repertoire. Humanistic
tourist doesn’t want to separate herself from the real
environment and she does want to merge and melt
within the real environment with her self-styled
manner, not in commercially designed touristic site.
Last but not least, humanism movement should
abandon seeing human beings as homo economous
and should regard them as homo ludens.
In line with Tribe (2006, 2010), tribe and
Airey (2007), Franklin and Crang (2001) I believe
that tourism cannot be understood unless the
present mentality in research, which has made
an unfortunate marriage with marketing and
management disciplines, continues. In particular,
the marriage with these disciplines and the
“positivist ambitions” behind scientific labeling
and classification in research has led to the
emergence of flat-footed child who is unhappy
both psychologically and sociologically. The first,
and perhaps the most important criticism is that
responses of people who are forced to respond to
research questions are considered correct without
considering the possibility and impact of chemistry
change as a result of being on a holiday (Yüksel
2017). It would be a scientific deception to expect
that the chemistry of a man, struggling with jetlag
and / or insomnia after a long journey, forcing
extra tensions to the already crippled cognitive
functions, will produce uncontaminated answers
to the questions. Secondly, the obsession with
“exact certainty” and “generalization through
standardization” inherited from other disciplines
in tourism research are destroying individual based
realities catastrophically that is unique to each
person. Certainty in tourism research is doubtful
since whether human nature is determinist or not
is still a question, an unresolved issue. Thus, the
current logic followed in many tourism research,
largely coming from determinist approach, itself is
extremely controversial. According to the classical

206

logic of this paradigm, one hypothesis is to be
accepted or rejected as true or false. However, to say
fully “yes” or fully “no” for a concerning hypothesis,
that is to be certain about the result for hundred
percent, is not always possible in the real world. Third;
one should start with questioning the “secret whys”
of tradition in which “extreme” values are victimized
and sacrificed for the sake of taking a mathematical
average or standardization. Note that, extreme cases
may contain much more valuable information.
Fourth; the development of good questions has
been abandoned due to the popular culture and
ready-made so called universal sets (copy-paste) of
questions has been taken as a panacea. Note that,
not just the answers but the questions rule the life.
Objectivity in research is much desired but more
diluted condition, an artefact of artificial reality.
Note that, objectivity in research is a subjective
illusion. I must not that what is valuable research
anyway? For a research to be valuable should it find a
difference/relationship or prove that the difference/
relationships (if any) found is coincidental or not?”
Last but not least; the conventional tourism persists
to use a “defective research template”. In fact, this
template produces stale, mostly useless information,
repeats the same issues over and over again. Thus,
thanks to the researchers tourism has evolved into
an effort to classify a series of actions of travel, stay,
and departure, which can be counted as one of a
series of different, local incidents of a ruthless but
sensible economic man. Hence the aim of tourism
research has been shifted to find a subclass under
a general class, the subclass under the subclass, and
the subclass under the prior subclass. This is a big
delusion. As a result, it is assumed that tourism
can be organized and managed through researchbased “to-do lists.” This is a far-fetching dream.
If questionable practices of small sample sizes,
tiny effects, underpowered experiments, invalid
exploratory analyses, flimsy replications and flagrant
conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for
pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance
continue in the humanistic tourism era as it is, then
we will hear the following lines more often:

In sum, research practices should reconsider their
roots in the history, where they originate from
and should not forget that “reasoning” through
observing, thinking and asking questions from real

life is science.Hence, a comprehensive inquiry into the hegemony of current logic and other misconceptions
that prevail in research practices and literature in the name of doing better science for understanding and
explainingtourism phenomenon is warranted more than ever. And I strongly suggest the Nobel Prize
Committee to consider devising a new award/prize scheme or expand the scope of the existing Holberg
prize for social scientists in tourism who dare to replicate his study before publication.

ABSTRACT

T

his study aims to investigate the satisfaction level of the residents in Eskisehir from the tram
services in the city through the European Customer Satisfaction Model (ECSI). Structural
Equation Model (SEM) was adopted in order to test the model. The factors taken into consideration
in the research model are image, Customer Expectations, Perceived Quality, Perceived Value, Customer
Satisfaction, Customer Complaints and Customer Loyalty. For this purpose, 360 passengers waiting
for tram at 9 tram stations in Eskisehir in May 2019 were surveyed. The analysis was based on the data
obtained from 354 survey forms. The research model was analyzed with SEM and the suitability of the
model was evaluated according to various compliance criteria. According to analysis results, the chisquare value calculated for model fit was 176,22 and (χ2/sd) value was calculated as 1,43. As a result of
the study, statistically significant relationships were found between the variables.

INTRODUCTION
Public transport services are considered to be one of the most important factors demonstrating the quality
of a city. It is vital that the residents can go to their jobs and schools easily and do not encounter any
problems related to transportation in their social lives. It has been observed that improvements in public
transport services in recent years affect customer satisfaction and the quality of life. The awareness of public
transportation services has attracted the attention of the scientific world. Therefore, many articles on public
transport services have been published in recent years. Public transport services, especially in crowded
destinations, are a cost-effective solution for traffic congestion. Also its improvement is critical for the city
managers and decision-makers. One of the most important public transport services that facilitate the lives
of residents is the tram (Gronau and Jagermeier 2007; Le-Klähn et al., 2014; Isikli et al., 2017). Thus, the
opinions of the residents are needed for the improvement of tram systems. This view makes up the starting
point of this research.
In May 2002, the Eskisehir Metropolitan Municipality signed a construction and supply contract with
Bombardier Transportation Consortium to construct a modern tram system in the city in line with the
transportation master plan. The project was completed in 20 months. ESTRAM, which won the 2004 Light
Rail System Award of the year in International Transportation, was put into service in Eskişehir in December
2004. In this process, the integration project of ESTRAM and other public transportation services was
carried out. Bus and minibus routes have been determined to support ESTRAM passing through the city
center. The aim is to reduce the traffic density in the city center and increase pedestrian areas. In this context,
the pedestrian zones and public parks were restructured. Eskişehir is the city with the highest rate of rail
system usage in Turkey. The tram system of Eskisehir is awarded by the UITP in 2004. The length of the

208

rail system in Eskisehir is 37 km. There are 37 tram
vehicles in the rail system fleet. According to 2017
figures, passenger capacity is 41.6 million. There
are 7 routes on the 37 km long tram network. These
routes are; Otogar-SSK, OGU-SSK, Otogar-OGU,
71 Evler- Opera, OGU-Çankaya, SSK-Batikent,
SSK-Camlica (Eskişehir Urban Rail Systems, 2019).
In this study, the satisfaction of the residents in
Eskişehir from tram services was investigated with
the European Customer Satisfaction Model (ECSI).
Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to test
the research model.

LITERATURE REVIEW
In order to reach an appropriate level of service
quality in rail systems, service providers should
consider many service quality factors associated
with public transport. Isikli et al. (2017) investigated
key service quality factors that increase passenger
satisfaction in Istanbul’s rail transport network
system using the data obtained from a comprehensive
survey conducted by Istanbul Public Transportation
Inc. The importance of service quality factors has
been evaluated in order to prioritize service delivery
and increase passenger satisfaction by using various
social selection techniques. According to the results
of the research, the main service quality factors for
the public interest are; costs, waiting and crowds.
Mouwen and Rietveld (2013) evaluated several
factors that determine whether competitive
systems in the Netherlands are effective in terms
of service quality, number of trips, timing, speed
and cleanliness. Dell’olio et al. (2011) described
waiting time, cleanliness and comfort as the most
important public transport factors. Redman et al.
(2013) conducted a comprehensive study on service
quality factors in public transport. According to this
study, reliability, price, speed, access, comfort and
convenience are the most important factors driving
people to use public transport. Hassan et al. (2013)
stated that the most desired service quality factors
of public transport services consist of travel time,
travel distance, service time, reliability, frequency,
capacity, price, cleanliness, comfort, security,
personnel and information.
Brouns et al. (2009) investigated the balance
between the impact of access to the station on
passenger overall satisfaction and the factors of
public transport services. It is claimed that the
interest in the railway network can be increased
by improving services in some parts of the public

transport network. Eboli and Mazzulla (2007)
investigated the effect of the relationship between
global customer satisfaction and service quality
characteristics. Another study conducted by Eboli
and Mazzulla (2012) analyses how passengers
perceive different quality factors of public transport
services. According to the results, the most
important factors are speed, consistency, frequency
and cleanliness. Yılmaz, et al. (2016) investigated the
satisfaction of service quality, image and customer
impact on customer complaints and loyalty.

METHOD
This section contains information about the research
model and hypotheses, the universe and the sample
of the research and the data collection tool.

European Customer Satisfaction
Index (ECSI)
Customer and satisfaction are accepted as important
factors in improving the quality of products and
services for companies / institutions / organizations
(O’Loughlin and Coenders, 2002). Customer
satisfaction is a concept that is given importance
by the manufacturers. Higher customer satisfaction
creates higher profit and higher market-share. In
addition, it gives companies a sustained competitive
advantage (Fornell, 1992). Customer satisfaction is
generally recognized as an important determinant
of repeat sales, positive opinion and customer
loyalty. The customers who are satisfied with the
bought products purchase the same product again
and tell their satisfaction to other consumers
(Fornell et al., 1996). Higher consumer satisfaction
has many benefits to companies such as increased
customer loyalty, improved firm reputation, low
price flexibility, lower costs of future transactions
and higher employee productivity (Anderson and
Fornell, 1994).
The ECSI model is a structural model based on
the assumptions that customer satisfaction consists
of a number of factors such as perceived quality
(PQ), perceived value (PV), customer expectations,
and the image of the firm. These factors are pioneers
of overall customer satisfaction. This model also
predicts results when a customer is satisfied or not.
01model consists of a latent
Each factor in the ECSI
structure managed by multiple indicators (Johnson
et al. 2001).

ECSI that was a modified version of the ACSI model considers the European economy as a whole.
Therefore, the countries’ Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) scores can be compared with each other
countries and with the European average (Eklöf and Westlund, 2002). The customer satisfaction PQ, PV,
customer expectations and loyalty structures in the ECSI model are modelled like ACSI. The main difference
between ACSI and ECSI models is the ECSI model contains the company image as a latent variable in
the model. In the ECSI model, the company image is expected to have a direct impact on customer
expectations, satisfaction and loyalty. The image structure evaluates the basic image of the company
(Andreassen and Lindestad, 1998). The image is considered to consist of an important component of the
customer satisfaction model. The image consists of reliability, professionalism, innovation and prestige.
The main purpose of image is to contribute to the society (Martensen, Kristensen and Grønholdt; 2000;
Grigoroudis and Siskos, 2003).
Customer expectations (CE) are identified as the level of quality that customers expect from the product
they want to buy. It is the result of previous consumption experience of a product or service (O’Loughlin
and Coenders, 2002). Customer expectations predict the capability of service providers to deliver quality
products in the future. Therefore, it has a direct and positive relationship with the evaluation of the firm’s
performance.
Perceived quality (PQ) is vital to overall customer satisfaction (Fornell et al., 1996). Perceived quality
is expected to have a positive impact on overall customer satisfaction (Anderson et al., 1994). Perceived
quality is a widely studied and discussed issue (Cronin and Taylor, 1992). In the literature, PQ was modelled
as a direct measure of value (Cronin et al., 2000). Parasuraman and Grewal (2000) asserted that the qualityvalue-loyalty chain is a subject that needs more experimental research. In the literature of management
information system (MIS); PQ has been accepted as the determinant of user / customer satisfaction of
information systems along with information quality, system quality and service quality (DeLone and
McLean, 1992). The quality is expected to have a direct impact on value (Anderson and Sullivan, 1993;
Fornell, 1992). Quality and value are measured and adjusted for the price factor (Anderson et al., 1994).
Therefore, CE and PQ are expected to have a positive relationship (Fornell et al., 1996).
Perceived value (PV) is the level of perceived product quality according to the price paid or the direction
of customer experience (Parasuraman et al., 1988). The value is defined as the ratio of perceived quality to
price (Anderson et al., 1994). The literature of service management has shown that customer satisfaction
is the result of a customer’s perception of value (Hallowell, 1996) and an important measure of overall
satisfaction (Fornell et al. 1996). Also, the addition of PV to the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) model
increased the comparability of results for companies and sectors (Anderson and Fornell, 2000).
Customer loyalty (CL) is defined as the continuous re-purchase of a preferred product / service in the
future (Oliver, 1999). It is important for marketers to understand the consequences of customer satisfaction,
including customer loyalty (Bei and Chiao, 2001) and the intention to continue working with a particular
provider (Burnham et al. 2003). Customer satisfaction leads to more customer loyalty (Anderson and
Sullivan, 1993; Fornell, 1992). Customer loyalty increases future revenue (Fornell, 1992), reduces production
costs (Reichheld and Sasser, 1990) and reduces price flexibility (Anderson, 1996). Customer satisfaction is
considered to be an important impact on the formation of consumers’ future purchase intentions (Taylor
and Baker, 1994). Therefore, it is thought that there is a positive relationship between customer satisfaction
level and customer loyalty.
Complaint is defined as a conflict between the customer and the organization (Yu vd., 2005).
The satisfied customer tells the other potential customers about his or her positive experiences. In other
words, it is possible to make word of mouth marketing (File and Prince, 1992). Fornell et al. (1996) claimed
that the result of increased customer satisfaction is a reduction in complaints and therefore the relationship
between customer satisfaction level and customer complaints should be negative. The relationship between
customer complaint and customer loyalty depends on the complaint management capabilities of company.
The ESCI model assumes that customer complaints have a positive impact on loyalty.

The Results of Structural Equation Modelling
The goodness and acceptable of fit values of the structural equation model is given in Table 2.
Table 2. Goodness of Fit Values of The Structural Equation Model

212

According to Table 2: the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) value calculated for the
fit of the model is 0.035, Goodnes of Fit Index (GFI) value is 0.95, X2 value is 116.30, Standardized RMR
value is 0.038, X2 / df = 116.30 / 81 = 1, 43. When the results of the recommended model are examined, it
can be said that the ECSI model is within acceptable limits.
Firstly, the suitability of the data to the multivariate normal distribution was tested for the selection of
the appropriate parameter estimation technique. The chi-square value was calculated as 600,274 (p < 0,01)
and it was determined that the data set was not distributed normally. Therefore, Robust ML was used as
the parameter estimation method. The standardized parameter estimates of the ECSI model are given in
Figure 2.

Figure 2. ECSI Model for Eskişehir Tram Services

According to results shown in Figure 2, a positive relationship was found between Image and Customer
Expectations variables. One unit increase in the image variable causes a 0.88 unit increase in the customer
expectations variable. On the other hand, there was no statistically significant relationship between Image
and Customer Satisfaction and Image and Customer Loyalty variables. A positive relationship was found
between Customer Expectation and Perceived Quality variables. This result shows that one unit increase
in customer expectations will result in an increase of 0.68 units in perceived quality. There was a positive
relationship between Customer Expectation and Perceived Value variables. This result indicates that one
unit increase in customer expectations will result in an increase of 0.34 units in perceived value. A positive
relationship was found between Customer Expectation and Customer Satisfaction variables. One unit
increase in customer expectation increases customer satisfaction by 0.41 units.
There was a positive relationship between Perceived Quality and Perceived Value and Perceived Quality
and Customer Satisfaction variables. In addition, a positive relationship was found between Perceived Value
and Customer Satisfaction variables. A positive relationship was found between Customer Satisfaction and
Customer Loyalty variables. This value indicates that one unit of change in customer satisfaction will result
in 0.51 units of change in customer loyalty. There was a positive relationship between Customer Satisfaction
and Complaint variables. Accordingly, one unit change in customer satisfaction causes 0.74 units change
in the complaint. There was no significant relationship between Complaints and Customer Loyalty latency
variables.

According to the results shown in Table 5, 77% of the change in customer expectation is with image, 39%
of the change in perceived value with customer expectations and perceived quality, 47% of perceived quality
change with customer expectation, 81% of change in customer satisfaction perceived quality, perceived value
and customer expectation and 55% of the change in the complaint are explained by customer satisfaction.

CONCLUSION
The residents in Eskisehir frequently use tram services in their daily lives. In this context, determining the
quality of service provided by ESTRAM is of vital importance for residents in Eskisehir. The attitudes of
the residents in Eskişehir towards tram services were investigated by utilizing ECSI model and SEM in this
study. ECSI model consists of customer satisfaction, perceived value, customer loyalty, perceived quality,
complaint, customer expectation factors. In the research context, a positive relationship was found between
image variable and customer expectation variable. This result indicates that 01
ESTRAM will have a positive
impact on the quality of service as the relations with customers are established, technology develops and
corporate image increases. No statistically significant relationship was found between image and customer
satisfaction and image and customer loyalty variables and hypotheses were not supported. A positive
relationship was found between the expectations and the perceived quality variables. This result indicates
that the perceived quality level of the tram company meets the expectations of customers. Similarly, a

215

4th International Tourism Congress

significant relationship was found between customer expectation and perceived value variables and the
hypothesis was supported. There is a positive relationship between customer expectations and customer
satisfaction variables. This means that customer satisfaction for the tram company increases as expectations
of customers are met. A positive relationship was detected between perceived quality and perceived value.
In other words, if the passengers are satisfied in the service that they receive, their assessment of the fee that
they pay for the service will also be positive. Similarly, a positive relationship was found between perceived
quality and customer satisfaction variables. Accordingly, it can be said that the better the travel experience,
the more positive their satisfaction will be.
There was a statistically significant relationship between perceived value and customer satisfaction
variables. The satisfaction of the customers who think that the quality of service provided on the tram
meets the fee will be positive. Likewise, a positive relationship was found between customer satisfaction
and customer loyalty variables. Accordingly, as satisfaction of customers increases, so does the loyalty of
customers. There is a statistically significant relationship between customer satisfaction and complaint
latent variables. According to this result, as the tram services offer solutions to the complaints of customers,
the satisfaction of customers increases. On the other hand, there was no statistically significant relationship
between complaint and customer loyalty variables and hypothesis was not supported.

ABSTRACT

T

his study aims to identify the profiles and preferences of business travelers staying in hotels in
Manisa from the perspectives of hotel general managers. Face to face semi-structured interviews
were carried out with ten general managers of touristic hotels in Manisa. Content analysis which
is a qualitative method has been applied to the data that have been gathered through interviews, by using
NVivo 11. As a result of the content analysis, four main themes emerged from the data as “profile of
the business tourist”, “buying behaviors of business tourist”, “types of reservation” and “leisure activities
of business tourist”, and thirteen codes have been identified under those four main themes. The results
indicate that majority of the business tourists staying in the hotels are domestic (Turkish) travelers.
Another significant finding is that majority of the business travelers are on average staying for 3-4 days
and most of them are doing their reservations through employing firms.
Keywords: Business Travelers, Business Tourism, Hotels, Intermediary Firms, Manisa

INTRODUCTION
Individuals are not traveling just with the motivations of entertainment and leisure but also they are
traveling to join meetings or do tasks related to their work and occupation. In this regard, business travel
and tourism (business travel and business tourism are used interchangeably) is one of the oldest types of
tourism (Seebaluck and Naidoo, 2015). Business tourism has an imported role on development of local and
regional economies because it increases the occupancy rates of accommodation facilities during the low
season and the consumption of food and beverage products and helps developing activities (Seebaluck and
Naidoo, 2015; Quariti and Hamri, 2014).
There are many forms of business tourism which is an important type of urban tourism (Uca, 2019).
Major forms of business travel are individual business trips, group trips, meetings, incentive travel,
congresses, exhibitions, team meetings, and training trips (Niculaa and Elena, 2014). Among these business
tourism forms, congresses and meetings are the leading ones with the highest participation rate. According
to Mill (1990) 20% of the business trips are for participating in meetings.
Turkey is one of the leading countries in business tourism thanks to its developing economy and due
to its rich cultural heritage and accommodation facilities with new generation technology. According to
International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) 215 congress have been held in Turkey in
2015. With those statistics Turkey is 18th in the world and 11th in Europe (Kaya, 2017). Major cities with
developed infrastructure and superstructure such as Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya, Ankara are the main centers
of attraction for business tourism in Turkey (Kozak et al., 2017).
Along with these provinces Manisa is also an important province with a vast business tourism potential
due to its geographical location, developed infrastructure and superstructure. Manisa hosts organized
industrial zone where 224 national and international enterprises and factories located for production. In

218

addition to responding to domestic market needs,
these companies export to over 100 countries of
the world and total foreign trade volume amounts 8,1
billions USD (MOSB, 2019). Having an organized
industrial zone gives Manisa a certain advantage
in regards of business tourism. Those enterprises
and factories get many domestic and international
visitors throughout the year for individual business
trips, delivering goods to customers and taking
goods to markets, factory opening, technical service,
consulting, visiting a branch factory, and meetings
and training seminars they host. Those business
related trips and meetings keep province’s business
tourism alive all year. In 2018, 18.589 foreign and
487.599 tourists stayed in hotels in Manisa and
majority of those tourists visit the city for business
purposes (Manisa Provincial Directorate of Culture
and Tourism, 2019).
Despite the fact that business tourism has
a considerable ratio among the overall tourism
potential of Manisa, studies on that subject is very
limited (Özleyen and Tepeci, 2017) and there is
almost no actual statistical data related to Manisa’s
business tourism. In this regard, determining
the general profiles and preferences of business
tourists that visit Manisa and underlining the gap
in the literature can be considered important step
for providing guidance for future research on this
subject. In addition, this study is also important
in regard to preparing action plans for improving
business tourism, and to putting the right strategies
into practice to increase Manisa’s business tourism
numbers in the future.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Business travel is regarded to be the backbone of the
tourism industry because businesspeople repeteadly
travel for purposes related to their work and they
are not price sensitive as leisure travelers (Cook et
al., 2018:54). Direct spending on business travel
worldwide reached $1.33 trillion in 2017 and is
forecasted to grow by 7% in 2019 (Global Business
Travel Industry, 2018). Globalization and economic
activities throughout the world will enhance
business travel and tourism in the future.
Business tourism is defined as the travels of
individuals on issues related to their occupations
(Davidson, 1994). Niculaa and Elenaa (2014) stated
that business tourism is a type of tourism which
includes the business travels of individuals related
to their business fields and includes participation
in the activities organized by various commercial
and administrative organizations. Fairs, exhibition
visits, educational trips, seminars, incentive travel,

international congresses, professional conferences
and conventions are all covered by business tourism.
Individuals who participate in the congress with the
aim of learning different information about their
jobs and for the purpose of personal development
are also included in the scope of business tourism
(Uca, 2019).
Business tourist who is coming for conferences,
seminars, exhibitions, and congresses spend 2.5 to
3 times more than regular tourists do (Quariti and
Hamri, 2014). It is a known fact that leisure tourists
spend on average 750-800 dollars while business
tourists spend about 2000-2500 dollars (Kaya, 2017).
Business tourists are mostly young and middle aged
males and their income level is high (Cook et al.,
2018). Further, along with their business activities,
business tourists also participate in leisure activities
and visit cultural and historical places within the
destination during their leisure times.
Business travelers are critical for the success of
most tourism service providers, therefore managers
of these service providers need to know more about
business travelers. Previous studies found that
business travelers are more experienced users of
hotel products and sevices and they are more critical
of service quality than leisure travelers (Radojevic
et al., 2017). Business travelers will probably endure
to be more demanding of hospitality and tourism
services as they hope to get at a minimum the
current level of services and offerings as a standard
level of performance (Cook et al., 2018:54). Hoteliers
offer a wide array of benefits and offerings such
as frequent-guest or loyalty programs, corporate
pricings and discounts, special floors and sections
including business centers and upgrades to satisfy
and retain business travelers. The competition
among the hoteliers are intense, and the winners
will be those who constantly identify and respond
to the needs and wants of these demanding visitors.
Hotel selection for business travelers is mostly
determined by the convenience of the hotels’
location, proximity to facilities to be visited and
availability of business-related facilities such as
business amenities of the room, business center
with internet access, conference rooms and free
parking. Business travelers appreciate having a
business center and free internet access; they prefer
properties with a fitness center with a gym and a
spa, and with a non smoking policy (Çobanoğlu et
al., 2003, Radojevic et01
al., 2018). Hotels in Manisa
offer similar facilities and amenities mentioned
above to respond to the needs of business travelers.
Indeed, Özleyen and Tepeci (2017) investigated
the satisfaction of business travelers to Manisa and
found that the service standards and attiributes

219

of the hotels contributed to the satisfaction of business travelers. The current study aims to get further
information on the profiles and preferences of business travelers staying in hotels in Manisa from the
perspectives of hotel general managers.

METHODOLOGY
Interview method which is one of the common methods of qualitative research is adopted in this study to
gain a detailed insight on the business tourism in the province of Manisa. Due to the nature of qualitative
research, purposive sampling method is used with a smaller sample to make it easier to inspect the
structure of instances and facts in detail (Miles and Huberman, 1994). The sample has been determined by
a convenience sampling, which is one of the purposive sampling method. With the aim of determining the
profiles and preferences of business related visitors, hotel managers were interviewed.
The sample of the study has been composed of the hotel managers working in ministry licensed tourism
operations (3 to 4 stars) in the center of Manisa (and in Turgutlu and Salihli, districts of Manisa). According
to the data of Manisa Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism (2019) there are 14 hotels in the stated
towns and the city center. The managers of 10 of those 14 facilities voluntarily participated to the study.
Face to face semi-structured interviews have been held with the general managers of the participating
hotels. In semi-structured interviews “the number and the order of the questions are not fixed’’ (Kozak,
2015: 90). Thus, during the interviews, researchers did not strictly stick to the forms and they asked
additional questions to interviewees when further information is needed. Interviews have been held during
July of 2019 and they all have been held face to face in interviewees’ hotel offices. Interviews lasted about 20
to 30 minutes. Prior to the interviews, all interviewees have been informed about the aims of the study and
they have been ensured that their identities will remain anonymous. All participants were asked for their
permission for the use of voice recorders and all interviews have been recorded with the approval of the
interviewees. Researchers had an interview form with them during the interviews.
The questions in the study have been prepared by doing a comprehensive literature review (Cook et al.,
2018; Radojevic et al., 2018) and by consulting two academicians who are specialized in business tourism.

ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
The interviews were recorded with the voice recorder and audio recording was transferred to the
computer and turned into text. The data, which became text, were subjected to content analysis which is
one of the qualitative research methods. Nvivo 11, a qualitative data analysis software was preferred for
the determination of codes and themes in the content analysis. In this context, the interview texts were
transferred into Nvivo 11 program. Content analysis was conducted and compared by two independent
researchers. As a result of the content analysis performed in this program, subcodes were created within
the scope of 4 themes (Table 1). The resource field in Table 1 indicates the number of participating hotels
in which the codes occurred.

Buying behavior of
business traveler

All of the participating hotel managers stated that they did not keep any formal statistics about business
tourism. Therefore, managers were asked to give an approximate number. All managers informed that the
majority of the tourists staying in their hotels were business travelers. When the ratio of the tourists coming
for business purposes in the total number of tourists is examined, it is found that it is between 81% to 90% at
most. This high rate indicates that business tourism is a major market for hotels in Manisa. One participant
manager (# 10) states that the number of business tourists varies during the summer and winter seasons;
the numbers are high in the winter season. When the distribution of business tourists by nationality is
examined, all managers assert that the majority are Turkish guests. The rate for Turkish guests varies from
55% to 95%. Germany, Italy, China, Korea and the United States are among the countries where smaller
proportion of foreign guests (45% to 5%) come from.
Within the scope of the theme, in which the buying behavior of business tourists was examined, it was
found that business travelers mostly preferred (n=7) 3-4 days stays, shorter stays of 1 to 2 days and stays
longer than 5 and more days were realized less. It is stated that the duration of the stay varies according
to the purpose of business tourist arrival. For example, participant manager # 4 comments that “if there
are training groups, the average length of stay is slightly longer but the training groups are not much… for
example, if a machine is installed, the length of stay is generally longer for the business visitor.
Five of the managers pointed out that the extra spendings of business tourists in hotels is high. Within
the scope of this code, there is a daily extra expenditure ranging from 150 TL to 500 TL. In particular, two
hotel managers made a comparison with leisure tourists and expressed that they spend more than leisure
tourists do. As a justification for over-spending, the participant manager (# 4) remarked that especially
the business tourists from Europe have high alcohol consumption. Purchasing power of European tourists
01
is high. Therefore, the prices are reasonable for them. A participant manager (# 10), on the other hand,
points out that the extra expenses of the business tourist varies; some business tourists do everything in
the hotel, some eat at the company’s direction, use the company’s dry cleaner, and prefer the hotel only for
accommodation. In such a case, the expenses fall… Sometimes the company pays the extra expenses of the
guests (in-hotel) and in this case the expenditures are rising.

When the hotel board types are examined, it
is determined that the majority of the hotels (n=8)
serve bed (room) and breakfast and only 2 hotels
serve half board. In addition, for the meals not
included in the accommodation price of the business
tourist, it was found that they mostly preferred the
hotel’s à la carte restaurants (n=7). The location
of the hotel, especially its proximity to other food
and beverage services, is important for the guests
whether they prefer the hotel for food and beverage
services. Looking at the number of people staying in
the business tourist, it is also stated that they usually
stay alone but the number varies. For example,
participant manager # 2 reported that sometimes
business travelers have accompanying people. The
person accompany to them is mostly colleagues. A
business traveler rarely comes with his wife, but he
usually comes with his colleagues.
Within the scope of the booking type theme,
the channels through which business tourists make
their reservations are investigated. The highest
number of hotels was booked through company
channels followed by travel agencies, by person and
online channels. Participants state that the company
reservations are made by department assistants or
general manager assistants in the companies. Some
companies, on the other hand, have established
their own travel agencies due to the intensity of their
business trips. The participant manager # 7 and # 1
said that some factories have their own agencies. For
example, there are X companies and X agencies, both
here and in Istanbul. “Business travelers’ visiting
companies make reservations from their travel
agencies; this practice has been a trend for the last
few years. The reservations come in this way have
a 10% to 15% of share among all bookings. One of
the managers (#8), who states that they also receive
individual direct bookings from the travelers; In these
occasions, the company he / she works for makes the
reservations first, but then for the following visits the
individual traveler calls hotels for future stays.
Within the scope of the theme of leisure
activities of business tourists, codes of preference
for İzmir destination (n=5) and low interest in
the attractiveness of Manisa province (n=8) have
emerged. Most of the managers (n=8) state that
business tourists do not wonder about Manisa’s
tourist attractions and interests. Two participants
stated that they put Manisa’s promotional brochure
in hotel lobbies to increase interest, but these
brochures did not attract attention. One participant
(# 10) observed that business tourists are curious
about the city of Manisa. Business travelers desire to
visit Manisa during long stays, especially the interest
of foreign tourists is more than domestic visitors.
Five of the participants stated that business travelers
222

were more curious about Izmir than Manisa in
summer months; tourists ask questions about İzmir
destination. For example, a manager on this issue (#
2) stated that “İzmir is more attractive to people. It
is preferred more because of the night life in İzmir.
İzmir has become even closer with the opening of
Sabuncubeli Tunnel. You arrive in Izmir in half an
hour. In the same way, business travelers prefer to
stay in Izmir. The number of companies that do not
prefer to stay in Manisa is notable.”

CONCLUSION AND
IMPLICATIONS
The purpose of the study was to explore the
profiles and preferences of business travelers
staying in hotels in Manisa from the perspectives
of hotel general managers. Face to face semistructured interviews were carried out with ten
general managers of ministry licenced hotels in
Manisa. Previous studies mostly included business
travelers as the samples and required them to
provide responses to the questions regarding hotel
preferences and satisfaction (Çobanoğlu et al., 2003,
Özleyen and Tepeci, 2017, Radojevic et al., 2017).
This study reflects the knowledge and opinions
of hotel managers and the study findings benefit
local investors and policy makers as well as hotel
executives and investors and researchers in general.
Because business travelers are repeat customers
for hotels and they spend more on their hotels and
food and beverages per trip compared to other
tourists, it is important to determine the profiles and
preferences of business travelers for the cities to get
a larger share from this tourism segment. According
to the results of the study, majority of the tourists
staying in the hotels are business travelers. Turkish
travelers consist most of those business tourists.
Along with the Turkish business tourists there
are limited number of foreign tourists and their
nationalities are mostly German, Italian, Korean,
Chinese and Americans in descending order.
The length of business tourists’ stay in Manisa
Hotels is varied in regard to their purposes of visit and
majority of them stay 3 to 4 days and they also stay
alone. Business tourists spend on average 150 to 500
TL for such extras as drinks, souvenir, massages and
spas during their stay in addition to their rooms and
breakfast. Hoteliers should provide different services
and activities appealing for business tourists to increase
the length of their stay and the amount they spend for
extras. These offerings may be à la carte restaurants,
live music shows at nights, spas and massages, sport
activities and contests and they encourage tourists to
take part in those activities and events.

It seems that business tourists are showing little
interest to the attractions of Manisa during their free
time and they prefer to spend their leisure time in
Izmir. If business tourists spend their leisure time in
Manisa it helps the economic growth of the province
and the tourism services and enterprises within the
province get benefit of it. In the name of keeping
business tourist in Manisa, restaurants, cafes, bars
with different concepts must be opened, shopping
malls must be built, and events and entertainments
must be held.

ABSTRACT

A

fter the 1960s, traditional museums began to change according to the needs of society. Many
museums have been established at the local level to link with local identity to preserve cultural
heritage factions. Revolutionary concerns in society have emerged with new ideas about the
nature and purpose of museums. The ecological museum was the focus of international discussions on
the purpose of the museums. Within the boundaries of the geographic area or region, Eco museums
offered a strong importance on community membership, meeting the demands of society for conserving
its natural heritage and material culture (Davis, 2011:50).
Hugues de Varine, Secretary of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), coined the term of
Ecomuseum. It emerged from the combination of the concepts of “ecology” and “museum. This concept
was developed in 1971 for the purposes and aspirations of Robert Poujard who is French Minister of the
Environment (de Varine, 1971). Georges Henri Rivière introduced the first definition of eco-museum
in 1985. According to him, an eco-museum is a tool designed and managed jointly by a public authority
and local population. Professionals, amenities and assets provide public authority’s participation where
the local people’s involvement rely on its ambitions, awareness and individualistic approach. Ecomuseums are laboratories that contribute to the past and present studies about the local population
and the environment, and encourage the work of relevant experts in these areas. They are conservation
centres that help to preserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the local population. They
are schools engage and encourage the local population to understand their own future and environment
protection (Rivière, 1985: 182-183).
Eco-museums change and adapt to time, place and most importantly to community in which they
operate, the (local people) and their development needs. Therefore, the definitions of eco-museum
are always evolutionary (Babić, 2009: 245). Classic museum could be described as the sum of culturel
heritage, collections, expert team, building and visitors where ecomuseums much more than these ones
(Figure 1).

Figure 1. Graphical Exhibition of Ecomuseum Concept

224

According to dimensions ecomuseum can be examined in 4 categories which are micro-history, umbrella,
antenna, village ecomuseum.Micro history ecomuseums are usually installed in a single domain and
can consist of many buildings already used for traditional and local activities. The Ecomusée du Pays de
Rennes in Frésnes, the Usson en Forez ecomuseum in France, or the Museum of Peasant History in San
Martino di Bentivoglio in Italy are examples of micro history ecomuseum.
Umbrella eco-museum is developed on a geographical area with a large number of heritage elements
connected together by a common history or common material. It is in an area covering different
municipalities and usually has more than one museum site. The link between the different elements
is governed not only on the designated routes, but also through a regional development project with a
joint local governing organisation. Bergslagen ecomuseum in Sweden is an example of umbrella ecomuseums.
Antenna eco-museum shares many common features with traditional museums. It normally has a single
museum site and is dependent on another authority in its administration. This limited independence
naturally obscures the possibility of being a mirror of the local community.
The village-ecomuseum provides a series of sites grouped together to create a highly contextual
environment. By nature, it is suitable for staging live events. Such eco-museums also allow reconstructed
buildings to be sometimes used as a closer representation to open-air museums or theme parks than to
eco-museums. The d’Alsace ecomuseum in France and the Zuiderzee museum in the Netherlands are
examples of village ecomuseums.
Several studies have explored the effects of ecomuseum (Bowers, 2005; Corsane, 2007; Corsane, et
al. 2008; Dogan, 2010; Dogan, 2015; Palvis, 2017). A study conducted in the north-east England, the
forgotten traditions specific to that region were revived and as a result an increase was observed in the
self-acceptance levels and identity formation of the locals living in the region. In addition, various types
of ecomuseum concepts are highly necessary in terms of sustainability (Corsane, et al. 2008). A study
conducted in Gokceada in Turkey found that an eco-museum has positive results for the stakeholders
(Dogan, 2010). Mencarelli & Pulh (2015) compared traditional museums and new-style museums. In
traditional museums, there is no active participation while people are visiting, but in museums where
active participation is possible in eco-museums, they have concluded that participation is high and
there is an increase in the general consumption levels of visitors. Another study conducted by Liu &
Lee (2015) found that the impact of eco-museums on the region and its contribution to the promotion
of the historical area are great. However, it is stressed that natural beauties and resources were rapidly
damaged in the area. In the light of previous studies it could be said that eco-museum concept has many
advantages in terms of marketing, management and sustainability. On the other hand, carrying capacity
and protection usage balance should be taken account.

A Theoretical Proposal For Modelling Tourist Types and Behaviours

ABSTRACT

W

hen the literature on tourist behaviours reviewed, there we find a basic concept related to
tourists that can be termed as seeking. Tourists seek a variety of experiences and they all
participate in tourist mobility in their way. In this study the concept of seeking analysed in
the light of memetics. Tourist memes have defined as establishing bridges between tourism research and
memetics. The tourist meme is identified as a meme that in a close or wide relation with tourist mobility
which are carrying information about a place, an era or period of time, a culture, sub-cultures, cultural
items, styles, behaviours, individuals themselves, completely imaginary things, a religion or a belief,
an event, events or other memes and so on. It is accepted in meme/gene analogy when a meme spread
into a brain, it associates with other memes in a kind of package or other words, in a memeplex. For
this reason, tourist types re-identified as tourist memeplexes and tied theoretically with the concepts
of awareness, focus and goal. Kanerva’s conception of focus is used to more broadly define what a
meme was associated with, as Gabora does. In this statement, memes have accepted in the form of
information patterns encoded within the focus indicating the scope and experiential quality of the
individual’s awareness. The proposed theoretical model consists of three dimensions: tourist memeplex,
focus and goal. With this proposal, it is aimed to assess different types of tourist experiences together
which were defined by different authors. On the other hand, this model gives a chance to develop a new
and complex taxonomy to assess various types of tourist experiences in a single framework.

INTRODUCTION
One of the earliest interpretations of seeking in tourism, travel and leisure sciences is used by H. P. Gray
(1970) to define sunlust and wanderlust. In his words, ‘the pleasure traveller or tourist will be forced to seek
new areas further afield irrespective of whether s/he seeks wanderlust or sunlust activities’ (H. P. Gray, 1970,
p. 131). Regard to his construct, in sunlust, tourists seek ‘domestic amenities and accommodations’ and in
wanderlust, they seek ‘different culture, institutions and cuisine’ (H. P. Gray, 1970, p. 14). Within the same
period, a similar thesis with sunlust was suggested by Williams and Zelinsky (1970, p. 565) under the term
‘heliotropic’ and defined as a factor ‘namely a strong southward surge of sun-seeking, cold-shunning tourists’.
Later, Cohen (1972, p. 176) suggested on the drifters, as they seek ‘the excitement of complete strangeness and
direct contact with new and different people.’ One another concept mentioned by MacCannell (1973) as the
‘search’ for the authentic experience which is also mentioned in the introduction section of this study. Then
he adds that, almost everyone ‘in search of authentic experience, roots and self-awareness’ (MacCannell,
1977). Addition to this, Dann (1977, p. 188) suggests ‘related to anomie’ that tourists seek ‘to overcome the
humdrum, the normlessness and meaninglessness of life with more satisfying experiences’. Then we see this
again in Buck (1978) as pleasure-seekers who are ‘seeking escape from egalitarian affirmative action norms’.
Later, Cohen (1979) exactly defines tourists as seekers. For example, his ‘experimental tourist is in search
of himself ’. S/he ‘seeks to discover that form of life which elicits a resonance in’ him/herself. He thinks that
‘such seekers… experiment with among the alternative lifeways’. One another interpretation made upon ‘the
recreation-seeking tourist’ who ‘thrives on what Boorstin (1961) call pseudo-events’ (Cohen, 1979, pp. 184,
189). These kinds of studies are studies that try to understand the phenomenon from an anthropological
perspective.

There are also some business-driven perspectives which are based on psychological insights such
as the study of motivations. One of the earliest papers on tourist motivations studies has written by
Waugh (1956) related to tourist data use. In that paper, there are some concepts such as satisfaction,
expectation, decisions, likes, dislikes were used with the concept of motivation. These concepts are still
used as basic concepts of tourist behaviours. In addition to this, these concepts are also used above in the
section that tourist memes were defined. Another paper related to travel motivations is mainly about the

227

4th International Tourism Congress

transportation business. In that paper Hurst (1969)
also talking about satisfaction, decision making,
behaviours, attraction, perception. It is also
possible to find other pioneer studies related to the
study of tourist behaviours in tourism, travel and
leisure sciences. For example, in a study on travel
behaviour, interrelated concepts such as desire,
satisfaction, motivation, decision making were
used in a planning perspective (Gilbert, Peterson, &
Lime, 1972). At this point, it is useful to talk about
a cornerstone study written by Crompton (1979),
in which ‘the concepts of pull and push’ is reevaluated. He defines motives for pleasure vacations
in socio-psychological terms and classifies as: an
escape from a perceived mundane environment;
exploration and evaluation of self; relaxation;
prestige; regression; enhancement of kinship
relationships; and facilitation of social interaction
(Crompton, 1979, p. 416). Two years later, Dann
(1981) initiates to unite anthropological, sociopsychological and industry-driven perspectives
in terms of tourist motivations. In that study, he
mentions that ‘tourists seek a variety of satisfactions,
each in its own way contributing to the richness of
the travel experience’ (Dann, 1981, p. 203).
In this study, concept of seeking accepted
as starting point with the perspectives of tourist
motivations. As mentioned above, tourists seek
variety of experiences and they all participate in
tourist mobility in their own way. It is possible
to widen these ways. For example, in Urry and
Sheller’s (2006, p. 207) new mobilities paradigm,
it is mentioned that ‘asylum seekers, international
students, terrorists, members of diasporas,
holidaymakers, business people, sports stars,
refugees, backpackers, commuters, the early retired,
young mobile professionals, prostitutes, armed
forces; these and many others fill the world’s airports,
buses, ships, and trains’. When looking at his
mobility, it is really easy to say ‘all the world seems to
be on the move’. Reasons for these mobilities change
for one to other. When we talk about tourists, it is
possible to classify them under different classes. For
example, Cohen’s (1972) organized mass tourist,
individual mass tourist, existential, drifter and
explorer classification can be accepted as this type
of taxonomy. These examples can be increased with
various types such as adventure tourists, culture
tourists, sex tourists etc…
It can be easily said in the light of arguments have
made above that, tourists are in seeking of various
things such as exotic tastes, quite an environment,
sex –legal or illegal–, drugs, history, landscapes,
scene, adventure, peace, sea, sun, snow, sports and
much more… And these all can be tied with different
focuses such as relaxation, joy, pleasure, intellectual
228

enrichment, satisfaction, being healthy, amusement,
curiosity etc. This concept of focus is the key we use,
to link tourist behaviours with memetics.
From this point of view, it can be said that it is
possible to assess tourist motivations by starting
from a solitary point in the context of memetics (see.
Bayraktaroğlu, 2016). At the same time, analysing
cultural changes and commodification in the host
community is possible too (see. Bayraktaroğlu &
Wee, 2016). But it is also possible to think about
tourist stereotypes, host–guest relationships and
many other research topics under this theoretical
framework. In this study, creating a framework in
the light of memetics is aimed, in terms of seeking
discussed under tourist motivations.

TOURIST MEMES
Memetics, mainly, deals with the ability of ideas
and practices to replicate throughout and between
different cultural entities (Blackmore, 1991). The
definition of such a field of research resembles, in
one aspect, propaganda. This aspect is related with
to shape, at least to manipulate, people’s thoughts.
Propaganda can be understood in such terms, with
the dissemination of ideas and actions throughout
culture a unifying theme within many disparate
approaches to the topic (Sparkes-Vian, 2018, p.
395). On the other hand, in contemporary business
research, these kinds of attempts to persuade
individuals to buy certain goods or services were
called marketing. O’Shaughnessy (1996) asserts
that ‘even in the sophisticated discourse, the
words propaganda and marketing are used almost
interchangeably.’ Resolving this conceptual dilemma
is not the aim of this study since a definition could
be useful. Ellul (1973, p. 61) defines propaganda as
‘a set of methods employed by an organised group
that wants to bring about the active or passive
participation in its actions of a mass of individuals,
psychologically unified through psychological
manipulations and incorporated in an organisation’.
In Sparkes-Vian’s study (2014), propaganda and
marketing concepts were assessed under the
memetic framework and some arguments made
about it. It is also possible to examine ‘post-truth’
with these concepts. But as it was mentioned in the
previous paragraphs, this study is aiming to clarify
how this approach can be used in tourism research
rather than resolving conceptual difficulties (see.
Bayraktaroğlu, 2016; Bayraktaroğlu & Wee, 2016)
Tourist memes, in the context of tourist
behaviours, can be identified as memes that in a
close or wide relation with tourist mobility which
are carrying information about “a place, an era or
period of time, a culture, sub-cultures, cultural

items, styles, behaviours, individuals themselves,
completely imaginary things, a religion or a belief,
an event, events or other memes etc…” by looking
at meme analogy of Dawkins mentioned. These
memes can be; a magazine poster, part of a novel,
a TV advertisement, a narrative or a story that an
individual tells another, part of a documentary or
lyrics, a cartoon frame related Giza Pyramids or
the other things that carrying information about
“the moment” that of screaming individual over the
rollercoaster in Europa-Park when upside-down or
an image of an individual sitting on the rock alone
and watching the sunrise over mountains. Most of the
given examples are the memes that can be observed
within its meditator such as magazine, photograph,
books etc. Another way to observe memes is to
observe meme products, as it is mentioned above.
Maybe, souvenirs can be accepted as a good example
of the products related with tourist memes.
When this was exemplified via Urry (1990), it
can be said that what shaped the tourist gaze was
memes settled in the memeplex of a tourist. When
Cohen’s (1979) tourist typologies are taken into
consideration, for example, it can be asserted that
these typologies are actually the categories that have
been put forward as a result of the classification of
tourist memeplexes with similar characteristics.
Thus, it can be concluded that the new types of
tourists have emerged as a result of the ongoing
evolution of social cultures in general. In particular,
for tourism, post-tourists can be accepted as an
example for this kind of evolution. The point to be
reached here is related to the constant replication
of the memes in the tourist mobility, the change of
shape and the acquisition of new forms.

A MODEL PROPOSAL
Gabora (1997) used Kanerva’s (1988) conception
of ‘focus’ to more broadly define what meme was
associated with. In this statement, memes are
accepted in the form of ‘information patterns’
encoded within the ‘focus’ indicating the scope and
‘experiential quality’ of the ‘individual’s awareness’
(Gabora, 1997: 6). At this point, it may be useful
to explain the concepts of focus, awareness and
information patterns in an example. Gabora’s (1997)
‘cookie jar’ is an open framework for developing
a case. For example, the child is hungry, and this
hunger situation can be described as a need and

also it is a need of the first step according to Maslov
(1943: 370-397). The focus of the child can be
summarized as to satisfy this need. At this point,
that is, to appease his hunger. Now, let’s think that
Gabora’s cookie jar stands on the table in the same
environment with the hungry child. In order for this
child to have the awareness that the cookies inside
the jar can meet her/his needs, he needs to have
information about reaching out to the jar, opening
the lid, taking the cookie in it and eating it; or s/he
needs other kinds of information that help her/him
to predict this information or simply to reach cookies
in the jar (e.g. as breaking the jar). According to this
approach, it can be said that memes are information
patterns coded into the focus of suppressing hunger,
which is forming the idea of eating the cookies
inside the jar that stands on the table.
In Gabora’s cookie jar example, it is mentioned
that memes can be accepted in the form of
information patterns encoded within the focus.
This focus can be a need, a habit or something new.
It can simply be defined as a part of an individual’s
life. When the focus is accepted as self-amusement,
individual’s awareness regard to options of
amusing her/himself is being the main determiner
of the type of experience and experiential quality.
Let’s, think about a sex tourist. S/he seeks selfamusement. And s/he is aware of sexual intercourse
is a kind of experience that s/he can amuse her/
himself. This can be summarized as the behaviour
of a sex tourist. In memetics, it is accepted that this
behaviour of the sex tourist is determined by the
memeplex. And memeplex is defined as a structure
consisting of various associated memes. We can
call this memeplex the sex tourist as the shallowest
definition.
It is time to illustrate this approach through a
widely accepted concept. Cohen’s (1979, p. 184)
‘recreation-seeking tourist’ was found appropriate.
In his words, this tourist is looking for ‘the pleasure
of entertainment’. Now we can add another
concept termed as the goal. Now the goal of the
tourist becomes the pleasure –or ‘the pleasure of
entertainment’ in Cohen’s words–. Her/his focus
can be identified as, entertaining her/himself. We
accept that s/he is aware of recreational activities are
entertaining. And also, we accept that her/his level of
awareness or her/his framework of awareness is the
main determiner of the type of tourist experience
01
and experiential quality.

229

Figure 1. A Memetic Model on Tourist Experiences

In another example, for authentic seekers, self-enhancement, relaxation, entertainment can be defined
as the goal. It is possible to multiply these kinds of examples, but it is not found useful in this study since, the
main objective of this study to develop a memetic model to understand complex tourist experiences rather
than to develop a taxonomy. The crucial point in this framework is the focus, and her/his awareness of the
experience which s/he focuses, will get her/him to her/his goal. This perspective gives a chance to model
complex tourist experiences in a single framework (Figure 1).

CONCLUSION
Memetics is accepted as a steppingstone to understand tourist behaviours in a single complex structure.
With this study, it has been tried to present an approach that will make these initiatives meaningful by
forming the basis of the attempts made to explain tourist mobilities and the reasons underlying the tourist
motives.
MacCannell’s staged authenticity, Cohen’s types of tourist experiences, Urry’s often mentioned postmodern tourists and Adler’s analogy of travel as a performed art, have failed to explain the whole tourism
movement and have been critically criticized but they provided very valuable information about the nature
of the tourist mobility. Numerous theoretical approaches such as destination attractiveness and destination
competitiveness have risen on the legacy of these first initiatives. In this study, it is aimed to take this
knowledge to the next stage and to fill some remaining gaps and to make contributions of some new insights
on tourist behaviours research.
This model gave the opportunity to understand various kinds of tourist experiences in a single
framework. In Figure 1, we assess Cohen’s (1979) recreation-seeker, MacCannell’s (1973) authentic-seeker,
Gray’s (1970) sunlust and unspecified concept of sex tourist together. Through this model, it is possible to
assess different types of tourist experiences together which were defined by different authors. On the other
hand, this model give chance to develop a totally new and complex taxonomy to assess various types of
tourist experiences in a single framework.
By its nature, the memetic approach has the potential to provide a new perspective on many issues such
as tourist motivations, tourism marketing, tourism sociology, tourist-local relations, and the socio-cultural
effects of tourism. It is another important aspect that it claims to make explanations about the nature of
tourism by bridging it with the nature of humankind. In this respect, the use of the concept of meme to
understand the nature of tourism does not only provide a chance to explain tourist motives but also opens
up new research areas for tourism marketing and tourist behaviours research.

ABSTRACT

W

hen the developmental process of the tourism sector is examined, it is seen that the progress
in the transportation sector has an important role in the development of the tourism sector.
Technological advances in the transportation sector have led to the expansion of the market
and brought intense competition among transportation alternatives. For this reason, it is of great
importance that transportation companies know the reasons why passengers prefer one alternative
over the other. Customer satisfaction, which is the core of marketing activities for enterprises; is a
psychological concept that expresses the feeling of well-being of customers during the consumption of
the delivered goods or services.
This research was conducted to find out the contribution of Turkey’s High-Speed Train (YHT) project
to creating loyal customers, to measure the quality of delivered goods and services on YHT through
the eyes of passengers and to determine the importance of the satisfaction levels in the intention of
revisiting. In this study, a questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. There are 36 questions in
the survey. In the first part, there are 7 questions to determine the demographic characteristics of the
participants, and in the second part, there are 29 questions designed in the form of 5-point Likert scale
to determine the satisfaction levels of the passengers travelling by YHT. Considering that passenger
profiles may vary, the questionnaires were administered on different rail lines on different days and
times of the week. A total of 400 questionnaires were administered by random sampling method and
311 of them were found to be appropriate and submitted for analysis. In order to determine the thoughts
of the passengers travelling by YHT regarding the quality of the service they receive and the effect of
their thoughts on their intention of travelling again, 4 dimensions were expected to emerge in line with
the dimensions of a similar study conducted by Kılıçlar, Sarı and Seçilmiş (2011). These dimensions
were named “The Effect of Staff Attitude”, “Cleanliness and Comfort”, “Scheduling of Train Hours” and
“Quality of Food and Beverage Services”.

When the relationship between personality variables and satisfaction sub-dimensions was examined,
it is understood that the positive perception of satisfaction sub-dimensions has a positive effect on the
intention of revisit and recommending YHT to others. It can also be concluded that the passengers
whose expectations have been met want to travel again by YHT. In the study, the hypotheses suggesting
that there are significant and positive relationships between satisfaction sub-dimensions and behavioral
intentions were confirmed.

INTRODUCTION
Tourism and transportation, which is a movement of displacement, are two closely related economic
activities. While the development of tourism started and progressed depending on the advancements in
transportation systems, the spread of tourism also developed the transportation facilities. Many studies

232

are claiming that there is a significant relationship
between transportation infrastructure and demand
in tourism sector (Martin and Witt, 1988; Gürdal,
1990; Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008). In terms of
holiday satisfaction, the place of transportation is
very important in providing satisfaction.
In terms of tourism transportation facilities
in the world, airlines are preferred more for long
trips, and railways are demanded especially for
short trips. Railway transportation has become
a means of transportation which is preferred
more than other transportation systems with its
advantages, speed and comfort in recent years.
Railway transportation has become an important
alternative with the emerge of high-speed trains
in order to meet the increasing and diversifying
travel movements in line with the increasing
globalization (İnan and Demir, 2017).
The rate of car accidents happening on highways
around the World, traffic jam resulted from
busy traffic and the air pollution caused by land
transportation have caused railways to come to the
fore and to be popular in most Asian and European
countries (Kızılırmak, Kaya and Çifçi, 2014).
Turkey has started to gain momentum in rail
transport since the early 2000s in parallel with the
related developments in the world. When we have a
look at the history of railway development in Turkey,
it is seen that it began with the construction of the
İzmir-Aydın railway line in 1856. During the last
periods of the Ottoman Empire, 4100 km of railways
were built in 68 years (1856-1918) when today’s
borders are considered. (Darkot, 1972). In the first
years of the Republic Period, railway construction
was given importance and in the first 15 years,
approximately 3000 km of railway line was built. In
1989, the length of the constructed railway line was
10,382 km. The railways, which were forgotten after
1950, were re-considered as state policy and railway
construction campaign was started in 2003 as done
in the first years of the Republic. The most important
indicator of this is that the railway investment, which
was 483 million TL in 2003, increased by 14.5 times
in 2015 and reached 8 billion TL. Between 2003 and
2011, 1,085 km of new railway lines were built. 2.078
km high-speed and conventional railway line is still
under construction. Establishment of a core highspeed rail network covering the lines of İstanbulAnkara-Sivas, Ankara-Afyonkarahisar-İzmir and
Ankara-Konya, keeping Ankara in the centre, has
been identified as the primary target of the new state
policy. In this context; the Ankara-Eskişehir section
of the Ankara-İstanbul High-Speed Railway Project
was completed in 2009, and the Istanbul section
was opened to the High-Speed Railway Operations

in 2014. Thus, Turkey has been among the major
countries with high-speed train technology. While
Ankara-Istanbul travel time has decreased to 3.5
hours with YHT, the other YHT line, Ankara-Sivas,
which is still under construction, continues to be
completed rapidly in 2019. On August 24, 2011,
passenger transportation started in Ankara-Konya
High-Speed Railway line.
It is expected that railway transportation will
continue to improve in the next years. In order to
sustain this positive development in the railways,
customer satisfaction should be measured and
service quality should be increased accordingly
(Kızılırmak, Kaya and Çifçi, 2014).
Customer satisfaction, which is the focus
of marketing activities for enterprises is a
psychological concept that expresses the feeling of
well-being of the customer during the consumption
of delivered goods or services (Pizam and Ellis,
1999, 327; Choi and Chu, 2000, 119). According
to Oliver (1997: 37), customer satisfaction is the
evaluation of the customer’s post-consumption
experience based on the relationship between the
perception of a service or product by the customer
and the objective elements of that service or
product. According to Parasuraman et al. (1994:
202), customer satisfaction is usually one-time
customer satisfaction. Service quality is an attitude
that emerges as a result of long-term performance
evaluation (Eleren and Kılıç 2007: 241). In order
to understand the concept of “service quality”
accurately, the characteristics of the service must
be well known. Various scientists have evaluated
the quality of service in different dimensions.
While Gronroos (1984: 37) considered service
quality as technical, functional and reputation
quality, Lehtinen and Lehtinen (1982: 6) evaluated
interaction with physical and institutional quality
dimensions. Hedvall and Paltschik (1989: 11)
defined the quality of service in their study and
focused on willingness, serviceability and physical
and psychological access to service. While the
quality and performance indicators of concrete
products are easy to measure, it is more difficult
to measure quantitatively how service companies
perceive and evaluate the quality of the abstract
services provided by the enterprises (Eleren and
Kılıç 2007: 237; Ardıç and Sadıkoğlu 2009: 170). In
addition, Sachdev and Verma (2004: 96) reported
that service quality could
01 be measured in terms
of customer perception, customer expectation,
customer satisfaction and customer attitude.
The most appropriate approach in evaluating
the quality of service is to measure the perceived
quality of the service by the customers due to the
reasons such as abstract nature of the service and

233

4th International Tourism Congress

lack of objective measurement tools in evaluation
(Türk 2009: 401). Providing services in order to
meet the demands and needs of customers is a must
for providing quality service. Only with his way,
businesses can meet their customers’ expectations
and increase the quality of the service perceived
by the customers (Okumuş and Duygun 2008).
After receiving the service, customers compare the
perceived service quality with the expected service
quality. If the perceived service quality is lower
than the expected service quality, customers may
lose their interest in the business and the service
provided. If perceived service quality meets the
expectations, customers continue to purchase that
service (Kotler 1997). The fact that companies have
loyal customers is an indispensable element to have
a competitive advantage (Piplani and Yonghui,
2005, 598; Avcıkurt and Köroğlu, 2006, 6).
Customer focus, which is defined as
unconditional customer satisfaction, aims to meet
the needs and expectations of customers during
and after-sales and to ensure customer satisfaction
continuously. In this way, it can be ensured that
satisfied customers tend to receive the product
or service from the same provider and become
loyal customers (Xu et al., 2002, 442; Öçer &
Bayuk, 2001, 26). Having consumer satisfaction
helps positive behavioural intentions to emerge.
The concept of behavioral intention covers the
customer behaviours in light of what they think
about the service after receiving. Behavioral
intentions are generally seen in the literature as
re-buying, re-visiting, recommending to others,
and encouraging positive thoughts. The increase
in satisfaction leads to an increase in behavioral
intentions (Liu et al., 2005).
Based on the above-mentioned literature,
a model has been developed to determine the
opinions of the passengers travelling by YHT
on the quality of the service they receive and
the effect of these thoughts on their revisit and
recommendation intention. With this model, it
was seen that 5 dimensions could emerge from
the above-mentioned literature. These dimensions
were named as “Effect of Personnel Attitude”,
“Cleanliness and Comfort”, “Scheduling of
Departure Hours”, “Price” “Quality of Food and
Beverage Services”. Satisfaction level of each of these
dimensions is thought to have a direct and positive
effect on behavioral intentions. Accordingly, the
following hypotheses were created and tested in
the study:
H1: There is a significant relationship
between passengers’ satisfaction of the service
personnel and their behavioral intentions.

234

H2: There is a significant relationship between
the passengers’ satisfaction of cleanliness and
comfort and their behavioral intentions.
H3: There is a significant relationship
between passengers’ satisfaction with the
scheduling of departure hours and their
behavioral intentions
H4: There is a significant relationship
between passengers’ satisfaction with food
and beverage services and their behavioural
intentions.
H5: There is a significant relationship
between the passengers’ satisfaction with
the prices of the YHT and their behavioral
intentions.
With this research, railway transportation
which has been gaining popularity as an alternative
in tourism was investigated through the eyes of
YHT passengers. In this context, the satisfaction of
the passengers concerning railway transportation,
organization/scheduling, personnel behaviors,
cleanliness/comfort, price and food and beverage
opportunities are discussed and alternative
suggestions for railway transportation are presented
based on the results to improve railway services.

METHOD
Sampling and Data Collection Tool
The population of the research is High-Speed
Train passengers travelling on Ankara-EskisehirAnkara, Ankara-Konya-Ankara and AnkaraIstanbul Ankara lines. From this population, the
trains numbered 81001, 81003, 81005, 81010,
81009, 81209, 81205, 81207, 81055, 81058, 81057,
81053, 81015, 81004, 81002, which are thought to
be the busiest ones were chosen. The questionnaires
filled by 311 passengers who volunteered were
considered in the study for further analysis. In this
study, the questionnaire technique was used as a
data collection tool. There are 36 questions in the
survey. In the first part, there are 7 questions to
determine the demographic characteristics of the
respondents, and in the second part, there are 29
questions in the form of 5-point Likert scale to
determine the satisfaction levels of the passengers
travelling in the YHT. In the survey form, in
which tourists were asked to mark the option that
best represents their opinion choosing the option
ranging from “1= Strongly Disagree” to “5=Strongly
Agree”. The questionnaires were completed by faceto-face interviews with the passengers travelling by
YHT between 10 May - 30 May 2019.

Purpose and Significance of the Research
The study aimed to find out to what extent meeting or failure in meeting the expectations of passengers
travelling by YHT, which is one of the most popular projects of Turkey, affected the passengers’ satisfaction
with the other services and their behavioural intentions. This research will contribute to the determination
of the wishes, needs and expectations of the passengers, the satisfaction levels of the passengers and the
effect of this satisfaction on the formation of loyal customers by examining the YHT case as is it is used by
more and more passengers with new lines coming into service every year. In the literature, there are studies
in the literature examining the relationship between service quality dimensions, customer satisfaction and
behavioural intentions. However, the main difference of this study from the other studies in the literature
is that it determines the relationships between passengers’ perceptions of satisfaction and behavioral
intentions travelling by YHT which has been an emerging tourism transportation tool. Considering the
size and objectives of the project, it is important to carry out such studies on YHT.

Data Analysis
In the analysis of collected data, the latest statistical programs in the field of social sciences were used. The
results obtained from the study were tabulated with the Weighted Mean, Standard Deviation, Percentage
and Frequency Method used in almost every study and comments were made in the light of the findings.
It is important whether the structure that is measured in any research has the same values continuously in
order to move onto the next stages of the research. For this reason, this study used the scale of the study
conducted by Kılıçlar, Sarı and Seçilmiş (2011) “A research on the reasons why passengers prefer highspeed train”. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were used to calculate the reliability of the scale. Cronbach’s alpha
was found to be between -1 and +1. As the value gets closer to +1, the reliability level of the scale increases
(Kılıç, 2016, s. 47). Cronbach Alpha coefficient calculated for the whole scale was found to be 0.823.
In this study, correlation analysis was conducted to determine whether there was a significant relationship
between passengers’ perception of satisfaction and behavioral intentions. A positive correlation coefficient
indicates that there is a linear relationship between variables, and a negative correlation indicates that there
is an inverse relationship between variables.

FINDINGS
The findings obtained from the questionnaire administered to the passengers travelling by YHT were
evaluated under three headings as “the findings related to personal variables”, “the findings related to the
evaluation of scale items” and “the findings related to the relationships between satisfaction dimensions and
behavioral intentions”. The findings regarding the control variables are presented in Table 1. When the age
distribution of the visitors was examined, it was seen that the young people aged between 18 and 30 had
the highest proportion with 53.1%. According to this result, it is seen that the majority of the passengers
travelling by YHT are between the ages of 16 and 30, and it could be concluded that young people generally
travel in YHT.

It is seen that 1.6% of the participants in the study are primary school graduates and 19’9% of them had
a post-graduate degree. The rate of those with an undergraduate degree is 47.9%. These results show that the
education level of passengers travelling by YHT is high. Moreover, 59.8% of the participants were male and
40.2% of them were female. When the occupations of the passengers were examined, the officers ranked
the first with 29.6% and the students ranked the second with 25.1%. According to these results, it could be
concluded that passengers travelling by YHT mostly travel for business and education.
Table 2 shows the average participation level of the survey participants in the satisfaction related items
towards the YHT and the kurtosis and skewness values regarding these items. The skewness and kurtosis
values of the items were found to be between -1,813 and + 1,998. The fact that the skewness and kurtosis
values of the data are between -2.00 and +2.00 means that they have a normal distribution. (George and
Mallery, 2010).

Behavioural Intentions

The highest level of participation among the statements related to the effect of personnel attitude in
the survey was in the item “the high-speed train personnel are kind, friendly and helpful” with 4.44. The
statements regarding the attitude in the survey had high participation rates. It is seen that the passengers
are satisfied with the attitude of YHT personnel towards them. This result reflects that YHT personnel are
conscious of their work and this situation is perceived positively by the passengers. Passengers participated
in the statements regarding behavioral intentions with a score well above the average. The statements with
the highest participation rates in the survey are the statements related to the effect on behavioral intentions.
The average level of participation in the statement “I will recommend the High-Speed Train to my friends
and relatives” is 4.39; The average level of participation in the expression “My habit of using railway services
has increased with High-Speed Train” is 4,43. And these two items are the ones with the highest participation
rate. These values show that passengers positively perceive YHT as a means of transportation. Among the
01
items in the questionnaire, the one with the lowest participation average is “music and video services in
High-Speed Trend are sufficient (3,11).

Correlation analysis was conducted to find out the relationship between the sub-dimensions of
satisfaction with YHT and behavioral intentions. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4.
There are positive relationships between all sub-dimensions of satisfaction variable except satisfaction
with staff and satisfaction with food and beverage services. As the satisfaction of the passengers with YHT
increases, their positive behavioral intentions also increase. When the correlation coefficients of the study
variables were examined, it was found that the lowest correlation coefficient was r: 0.229 and the highest
correlation coefficient was r: 0.564.
There was a very low, positive and statistically significant relationship between behavioral intentions
and satisfaction with food and beverage services (r = 0.229; p <0.05), and satisfaction with staff (r = 0.487;
p <0.05), and There was a low, positive and statistically significant relationship between price satisfaction
(r = 0.382; p <0.05), satisfaction with cleanliness and comfort (r = 0.500; p <0.05), and satisfaction with
scheduling and organization (r = 0.564; p <0.05).
According to the results of the correlation analysis conducted to find out the level of relationship
between the perception of satisfaction sub-dimensions and behavioral intentions, it was found that positive
perception of satisfaction sub-dimensions affected behavioral intentions positively. It can be concluded
that the passengers whose expectations were met in the sub-dimensions which form the satisfaction are
willing to travel again by YHT and tend to recommend YHT to others. As seen in the research findings,
the hypotheses suggesting that there are significant and positive relationships between satisfaction subdimensions and behavioral intentions were confirmed.

DISCUSSION AND SUGGESTIONS
In this study, the factors that determine the relationship between passengers’ satisfaction levels and
behavioral intentions travelling by YHT were investigated. The research data were collected through a
questionnaire and only the statements regarding the revisit intention and satisfaction dimensions were
included in the questionnaire. When the relationship between the dimensions obtained from the satisfaction
scale and behavioral intentions was examined, it was found that the positive perception of satisfaction subdimensions affected passengers’ behavioral intentions positively.
When the results of the study are examined, the positive behaviors of the passengers such as re-using
the transportation service or recommending these vehicles to their friends are related to their perceived
satisfaction. In the light of the analyzes, it has been shown that the value of services delivered in the
transportation sector has an impact on the future behavior of the passengers. That passengers save time and
that YHT trains are comfortable are the most effective factors in passengers’ revisit to YHT.
These results obtained with this study partially support the findings in the literature (Seçilmiş, Kaşlı,
Kılıçlar and Sarı, 2011; Kılıçlar, Sarı and Seçilmiş, 2011). According to the findings obtained from the
study, the strongest factors affecting the behavioral intention of the passengers are good departure hours,
organization, price, cleanliness and comfort. Especially in recent years, the rising prices on the highways
have made the railways even more inviting. Besides, YHTs are much more comfortable than passenger
buses. Improving the quality of services, cleaning, increasing the quality of food and beverage services are
very important in establishing the intention to revisit and creating customer loyalty. Likewise, the attitude
of the personnel is an important factor in the intention of a revisit. Therefore, by giving more importance
to the education of the personnel of YHT, personnel could be explained what the meaning of creating
customer loyalty for the enterprise is and how they could play a role in creating customer loyalty. While
working hard to establish customer loyalty to YHT, it should be remembered that different expectations
of customers arising from their characteristics will also affect their satisfaction. If customers with different
expectations are offered the same services, some customers will be satisfied and some others will not. For
this reason, YHT needs to diversify its services and increase its quality level.
The reflection of passengers’ high level of perceived satisfaction on their behaviours is that they
recommend YHT to their friends and define themselves as loyal customers of YHT. In brief, high satisfaction
creates loyal customers for companies. The perceived high satisfaction creates loyal customers for the YHT
and ensures that the passengers who are satisfied with the means of transportation voluntarily advertise
YHT. As a result, in the transportation sector, where there is intense competition, enterprises need to give
importance to their passengers’ perceptions to gain an advantage over their competitors.

ABSTRACT

U

rban tourism is becoming significant contributor of city’s economy and urban waterfronts.
These destinations perform diverse functions for the visitors, therefore they have to be
developed as important tourism precints. Environmental barriers constraint disabled tourist to
join tourism activities at urban waterfronts. Disabled people is a niche consumer market for the urban
tourism industry and so governments have to take responsibility to provide suitable arrangements
for these consumer segment. Accessible waterfornts allow disabled tourists to gain travel experiences
and participate urban tourism activities. Kyrenia city is the tourism capital of North Cyprus and it has
designed sea front which becomes main attraction pole for residents and many tourists of Cyprus Island,
due to its various architectural, cultural and historic points of interest. Tourism industry has been one
of the important sectors of North Cyprus’ economy. Disabled people and their families are potential
market for the tourism development. The purpose of this paper is to examine accessibility of Kyrenia
Sea Front for physically disabled tourists and explore the significance of accessible tourism at waterfront
precints. For the study, a qualitative research method, systematic observations, were used to make an
exploratory review on perceived environmental barriers in urban waterfronts by tourists with a range of
mobility capabilities. The research findings showed that Kyrenia Sea Front possesses physical and social
barriers, which represent challenges for its visitors, particularly disabled tourists still experience traces
of urban space exclusion. Accordingly, recommendations were given for maintaining accessible tourism
in Kyrenia Sea Front. The study highlighted the needs for further research that examines nexus between
waterfront design and accessible tourism activities.
Keywords: Accessible Tourism, Waterfront, Physically Disabled Tourists, Kyrenia Sea Front, North Cyprus

INTRODUCTION
According to statistical datas; in 2008 more than 600 million (TURSAB, 2008), in 2009 more than 650
million (Darcy and Pegg, 2011) and in 2011 more than 758 million (WHO, 2011; Pehlivanoğlu 2012)
people are disabled in the World. The current statistics shows that over one billion people, out of seven
billion population, lives with some form of disabilities in the World (Worldbank, 2019). If it is considered
that those people need special care and are travelling in the company of others or their families, this number
increases.
Disabled travellers market have subsequently a great potential ‘consumer market’ and to grow out of
significant ‘niche market’ for countries tourism industry (Son, A., 2010). Although the disabled customer
market is significant sector for tourism industry, academic research related to the travel of disabled people
has been scarced (Yau, McKercher and Packer, 2004; Öztürk and Yeşiltaş, 2007). In last decade, the issue of
accessibility in tourism has been a concentration of a few studies such as; an accessibility in accomodation
places (Darcy,2009; Öztürk et al, 2008); accessibility in tourist sites (Israeli 2002; Sen and Mayfield,2004);
accessibility of senior tourists (Alén, Dominguez and Losada, 2012); the
01significance of promoting
information for an access (Eichorn et al.,2008); and disabled tourist’s experiences (Daniels, Rogins and
Wiggins, 2005; Poria, Rachel and Brandth, 2009; Shaw and Coles, 2004; Yau et al.,2004; Son,2010)
In recent debate, an accessible tourism issue gain greater importance in the inquiry of environmental
design and practices. The accessibility is become one of the important concerns in the urban tourism
precintcs, in such fields providing barrier-free tourism become to be the main responsibilities of govermental
authourities, legal arrangements on disability rights in tourism industry come into force by the various

241

4th International Tourism Congress

countries. For that reason; disabled people began to
gain effortless travel experience and attend tourism
activities more (Pehlivanoğlu,2012).
The broad literature is revealed that handicapped
people are among the high potential visitor segments
of the tourism sectors, such segments requires
accessible attractions in urban tourism precints (Sen
and Mayfield, 2004). Those precints must be visitor
friendly urban waterfronts, there is a need to confirm
that well-designed features of the built environment
provide barrier-free tourist destinations. The urban
tourism precintcs such as waterfronts have to be
accessible to all visitors, therefore they ought to
be arranged with adaptable solutions that enables
people having different background in terms of age,
gender and capability.
The City of Kyrenia, as the tourism capital of
North Cyprus, having designed sea front which
attracts almost all visitors of the Cyprus Island
(Güvenbaş, 2008). Although; the Kyrenia Sea Front
is the most important remarkable destination place
of tourists, declining official tourism figures shows
necessity of favorable solutions for the tourism
industry. Tourists with disabilities are significant
potential market for the Kyrenia City’s tourism
industry, their families can doubtly involved in this
figures. The purpose of this study was to examine
quality of Kyrenia Sea Front with reference to
environmental design considerations on accessible
tourism development.
The paper proceedes in the following ways.
Initially, it was concentrated on literature review
related to the disability, accessible tourism and
urban waterfronts and tourism industry in North
Cyprus. Then, the methodology of study was given.
Following that, the findings of the research is put
forward that proved accessibility performance
of Kyrenia Sea Front for physically disabled
tourists. In the final section, it was aimed to put a
contribution for the accessible design solutions and
planning polices for designning of accessible urban
waterfronts.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Literature review, concerns concepts of disability,
accessible tourism, urban waterfronts and tourism
industry in North Cyprus, will be given at following
lines.

242

Disability, Accessible Tourism and
Urban Waterfronts
Urban tourism precints have been classified into
different typologies which includes recreational or
tourism business district; tourist shopping villages;
historic or heritage places; ethnic precints or
quarters; cultural precints or quarters; entertainment
precints; red-light districts or bohemian quarters;
waterfront prercints and festival marketplaces
(Griffin, Hayllar and Edwards 2008). In such
specific types, waterfronts are among the significant
tourism precints that are extensively issued to
redevelopment for tourism and recreational
activities, due to attractiveness of their location
(Craig and Smith,1995).
Waterfronts, as a part of urban tourism product,
major elements of leisure setting of urban tourism
destinations and so they can have a critical role
in attracting visitors to a city. Waterfront areas
offers diverse function such as housing, industry,
commerce, transportation, recreational facilities
and numerous leisure (Craig and Smith, 1995). The
characteristics of being waterfront setting, makes
these places interesting for tourism uses (Adamietz,
2012). Concerning potential of waterfronts on
tourism-related facilities, accessibility, parking,
open-space activities, water quality, sport areas must
prefer high performance for the tourists’ usage.
High quality in pedestrian access and open space
features offers visitors to engage in various facilities
(Adamietz, 2012).
The inaccessibility of destination areas as
waterfronts constraints disabled people to enjoy
the same destination experiences that other tourists
can enjoy and are compel to make accessibility
major determinant of destination choice (Darcy,
2002; Market and Communication Research, 2002).
Urban space accessibility is concern issues of relative
power and powerlessness which necessitate to alter
mechanism in the direction of modify environment
that allows their freedom (Griffin et al. 2008).
Disabled people are encountered with various
constraints and barriers when they are travelling
(Ozturk et al.,2008; Yau et al. 2004). Design-related
barriers impede disabled tourists to participate
contemporary urban life and waterfront facilities.
These barriers can be classified under two main
headings; physical and social barriers. Physical

barriers involve high kerbs and/or lack of dropped
kerbs, steeps without gradients or ramps, uneven
paving slabs, rough of cobbled surfaces, slippery
surfaces, narrow pavements, poorly placed street
furniture, congested pavements, steps without
adjacent ramps, dropped kerbs on roads not adjacent
to each other, difficult chamber on pavement, deep
gutters along roadside, impeding crossings, busy
roads, lack of resting places on slopes or ramps,
handrails not provided on ramps, insufficient
designated road-crossing places, drains near to
dropped kerbs, cars parked adjacent to dropped
kerbs, raised manholes, poor pathway maintenance
(Ungar,2008; Barış and Uslu, 2009). In addition
to these; inaccessible building entrances, public
transportation facilities, and inaccessible toilets are
among the significant physical barriers that limits
function of inviduals in urban environment (Barış
and Uslu, 2009).
The urban space is not produced in a naturalistic
way and so it is not possible to obligate process of
space production that involves extensive sociopolitical procedure and value systems. Accessibility
problem is also emerged by social environmental
barriers involving institutional barriers (lack of
legistlations and regulations on access features,
discriminatory policies on design issues, missing
knowledge of design practitioners, absence of
participatory planning actions), cultural barriers
(societal attitudes) and economic barriers
(unaffordable prices of urban space facilities),
(Goldsmith,1997).
The terms of tourism and accessibility were
initially mentioned by the Manila Declaration
and then particularized by the World Tourism
Organisation in 1980. The declaration have
appreciation for tourism as an essential right and
main tool for human development. “it recommended
the regulation of tourist services to member states,
highlighting the most important aspects of tourist
accessibility”. During the late 1980’s other term
“tourism for all” was intended to denote to tourism
for people with disabilities who can achieve full
integration with environment containning activities
on tourism (Alén et al. 2012)
Accessible tourism enables people with access
requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing,
and cognitive diemensions of access, to function
independently and with equity and dignity through
delivery of universally designed tourism products,
services and environment. This definition is inclusive
of all people including those travelling with prams,
people with disabilities and seniors (World Health
Organization,2007).

According to Rains (2004; ed. in Darcy, 2009)
for the tourism industry to adopt universal design
principles as a foundation to achieve greater social
sustainability (Darcy, 2009). Universal Design,
also referred to as inclusive design, design-forall, or lifespan design, originated as an concept
for the built environment in the United States, as
produced by wheelchair-using architect Ron Mace
(Green, 2011). The concept of universal design
asserts to minize the need for specially adapted
and segreated facilities while including all into
planning for equivalence (Bromley at al., 2006).
Nevertheless, each stakelholders interests to built
environment design and practices ought to adopted
a universal design principles in the provision of
built environments toward all-inclusive population.
An integrated access allows all visitors and
building users, whether able-bodied or not, to
use the same route throughtout. Meeting these
objectives minimizes the stigma attached to
disability, and reduces the segregation, frustration
and disappointment disabled people can experience
when they cannot get to or find where they need to
be” (Foster, 1997,4). Consequently, the accessible
destinations for tourists are accessible for residents
as well that supports the commonsurate benefits in
social engagement, health outcomes and economic
welfare (WHO, 2007a; ed. in Darcy et al, 2009).
In order to achieve accessible tourism
development; tourism operator should adopt
strategies together with the inclusive design
principles include the following:

In spite of that in various countries, the framework for developing accessible tourism or implementing
universal design through disability discrimination law, building codes and accessibility standarts still absent
(ESCAP,2008; Darcy et al. 2010). Universal design has urgently become a central issue in the development
and understanding of accessible tourism (Darcy et al.,2010)

A Brief Overview On Tourism Industry in North Cyprus
Cyprus is one of the Mediterranean Island and it has a long history, cultural heritages, hot climate and
clean beaches that make the island attractive for tourists. In Cyprus, tourism is an effective and foremost
sector which can facilitate to rise and ameliorate the economic situation by adopting sustainable tourism
development that is based on the quality ( Kiessel et al., 2011; Vehbi B.O., 2014).

Figure 1. Location of Cyprus

The current population of North Cyprus is around 286,000 (SPO, 2006). According to Tourism Planning
Department’s figures that shows tourists’ statistics belong to six months of a year (January to June); in
2018, 846.272 tourists, in 2019, 791.408 tourists visited the North Cyprus. The official figures revealed
that tourism industry has been one of the main sectors of North Cyprus economy (Tourism Planning
Department,2019).
North Cyprus is not able to offer distinguished tourism products in contrast with other Meditrerrenean
states, being unrecognized island state in the World obstacles tourism development in the country (Statistical
Yearbook of Tourism, 2009). Therefore, rules and regulations on tourism industry must be revised, produce
to gain competitive advantage via differentiated tourism product (Erdoğan, Kashif and Ivanov, 2010).
Incorporating accessible tourism development can generate competitive strengh for the North Cyprus’
tourism industry. Disabled people and their families are potential market for the North Cyprus tourism
industry and opening up this market will produce economic returns for the tourism market. Hence; the aim
of this study was to determine the accessibility performance of the urban waterfront for disabled tourists.
This research is help to determine the current situation of North Cyprus’ tourism industry in terms of
accessible tourism issue.

METHODOLOGY OF STUDY
Methodology of study will be explained in terms of sample site and data collection and analysis.

Sample Site
Kyrenia Sea Front, which is a kind of waterfront, is one of the most significant public open spaces in North
Cyprus. It is located in the city of Kyrenia, which is a linear coastal settlement on the north coast of the
island. Kyrenia is famous with its Castle and Yacht Harbor that partially define the Sea Front. Besides,
Kyrenia Sea Front is defined by historical and contemporary buildings at the center of the town. Kyrenia Sea
Front which offers various opportunities to its users; resting, recreation, shopping, eating etc., is a designed

244

public open space by the Local Municipality. It is an attraction pole for not only all the tourists coming to
the island but also the local people and the other people living on the island (Güvenbaş, 2008).
In this research; the main square of the Kyrenia Sea Front, Atatürk Square which is a significant node
attached the seafront with the town center, was selected as a representative sample. Ataturk Square is a civic
and quay square where people generally used for getting together in terms of realize diverse activities such
as meeting, sitting and other socializing events. The square is also significant node that connects the sea
front with the town center. Users of Kyrenia Sea Front are mainly completed their visit at this focal point.

Data Collection and Analysis
The qualitative research carried out through structured observations. Observations on-site activities and
physical traces, were used to gain a whole sense of participation in waterfront facilities, and contributed to
evaluation of accessibility performance of disabled tourists by directly observing real site conditions. The
observation forms were designed to document required data. During each observation session, problematic
01were listed under the main
features have been detailly documented on the form. Each determined problems
determinants; physical and social barriers. For the physical barriers, the quality of three sub-components
including building entranceways, pedestrian routes (sidewalks, curb ramps, pedestrian crossings), and
urban furniture and amenities (resting facilities, ATMs, lighting elements, garbage bins, signage, traffic
bollards, public toilets, bus stops) were evaluated. For the social barriers, three sub-components such as
political values (maintenance and management services), socio-cultural norms (societal attitudes), and
socio-economic-issues (affordability of urban waterfront activities) were examined.
245

4th International Tourism Congress

The study is only held for people who have a mobility restrictions like wheelchair users, people with
cane and walking stickers, elderly and others as parents with prams, pregnant women, children under seven,
people with heavy luggage who needs same arrangements in the built environment.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
In the further paragraph the research findings related to physical and social barriers will be explained.

Physical Barriers
Physical barriers were examined in order to three components; building entranceway, pedestrian routes,
and urban furniture and amenities.

Building Entranceway
The quality of entranceways was evaluated in terms of width, gradient, floor covering, and ramp location.
Problematic width arrangement, surface material selection, and level differences of entranceways present
problems to disabled tourists. The results revealed that single-steeped entranceways without ramps and
narrow thresholds create obstacles for wheelchair or scooter users, also negotiate parents with pushchairs
and ambulant disabled people to enter buildings with their self-control. Lack of handrails and non-slip
floor surfaces are handicapped ambulant disabled person and older adults who faced with problems regard
to maintain their balance while using those entrance ways. In addition to these; there was a bank building
entrance owning an ideal ramp gradient which unsuitably covered and diemensioned without handrails.

Figure 4. Unsuitable Arrangement Of Building Entrances Restrict Physically Disabled Tourists’ Access At Atatürk Square.

Based on the research results it can be stated that the quality of entranceways is negatively effected
disabled tourists’ usage at Atatürk Square. Building frontages and entranceways must be redesigned with
suitable inclusive design considerations. The proper ramps should be added instead of single-steeped
platforms. Floor covering materials and door openings must also changed with suitable form.

Pedestrian Routes
Availability of pedestrian routes such as sidewalks, curb ramps, pedestrian crossings was studied. Disabled
tourists are not able to move around Atatürk Square, especially wheelchair users must be accompanied by
someone else when they are travelling. The square is covered with tiles that are slip-resistant, but the joint
between the adjacent tiles are not appropriate in terms of accessible design features. Sidewalks are wide
enough, but unsuitable configuration of street furnishing elements obstacled pedestrians and do not allow
free passage for them during overcrowded usage periods.

246

Figure 5. Improper Design Of Curb Ramps Are
Troublesome For Disabled Tourist’s Access.

Figure 6. Joints Between Ceramic Tiles Create
Danger For Wheelchair Or Scoother Users.

The results indicated that pedestrian routes restrict disabled tourist users’ mobility in the Atatürk Square.
The overcrowded sidewalks were principal obstacle and sometimes obliged pedestrian to use vehicular
routes. Accordingly, sidewalks and pathways are inaccessible and unusable for tourists with limited mobility.
The quality of these components have to be improved by complying with contextual pedestrian volumes
and the principles of barrier-free access.

Urban Furniture and Amenities
Atatürk Square’s street furnishing elements include resting facilities, ATMs, lighting elements, garbage
bins, signages and traffic bollards. In general, the urban furnishing elements do not offer convenient or
flexible usage. The configuration of street furniture elements as lighting elements and garbage bins along
the pathway cause safety problems.

Figure 7. Oversight Location Of Street Furnishing Elements Create Danger For Pedestrians.

Sitting elements are not suitable for the uses of every people, because some
01of them are out of standart
and inclusive design requirements. Folding chairs offer problematic usage for the tourists with mobility aids
or having hand and arm disability. Benches without backrests are not comfortable or safe for elderly people
and pregnant women.

247

4th International Tourism Congress

Figure 8-9. Views From The Sitting Elements İn Atatürk Square

ATMs were generally placed on stepped platforms, do not have enough space for frontal approach, and
the height of mailboxes slot are troublesome for wheelchair users and very short people.

Figure 10. ATM Machines Were No Suitable For Disabled Tourists’ Uses.

The legibility of signage was in a good condition because signs that were placed in the square were
predominantly designed based on the inclusive use standards. Moreover, lack of illuminated signage is not
appropriate for night usage of the public space. Traffic bollards were placed for pedestrian safety, but they
are open to probable pedestrian accidents instead of protecting pedestrians from hazards. More useful and
accessible street furnishing elements are urgently needed in the Kyrenia Sea Front.
Public toilets are far from the Atatürk Square and they are frequently located below street level. Improper
design of such amenities creates problems for disabled tourists. The seamless travel is critical to provide
accessible tourism activities over transport chain and in that chain continuity of travel depends on the
availability of public toilet provision. Otherwise; travel of disabled tourists results with failure.
In addition to these; any bus stop arrangement were not determined in the Atatürk Square. The unique
bus stop was located at the enter of town center and there is a large distance between the Atatürk Square and
unique bus stop. Public transportation system must be revised.

Social Barriers
Apart from the physical barriers, social barriers were evaluated in terms of political values (maintenance and
management services), socio-cultural norms (societal attitudes), and socio-economic-issues (affordability
of urban waterfront activities).

248

Socio-Polical Values
Periodic and routine maintenance plays an important role for sustaining inclusive urban waterfronts for
disabled tourists. Poor maintenance facilities creates problematic usage, particularly uneven and cracked
paving slabs are not safe, create risks for pedestrian accidents. Besides; deficient parking control prompt
motor vehicle drivers to flout rules by parking prohibited curb side zones in front of the square. Whereas
there is double-yellow line along the vehicle lane, drivers still use towaway zone that means weak parking
control increases accessibility and usability problems.

Figure 11. Poor Maintenace Facilities Create Danger
For Disabled Tourists.

Figure 12. Parked Vehicles At Towaway Zone Restrict
Disabled Tourists’ Usage.

In order to achieve accessible tourism, it is essential to provide a range of statutory powers and
legislation providing mechanisms for right and proper arrangements in support of issues like urban space
management, design control review, public transportation management/control and parking management/
control.

Socio-Cultural Norms
Disrespectful behavior of able-bodied society
restrict tourists function in Atatürk Square and its
close environment. Although tourists with mobility
limitations can find well-designed curb ramp, their
accessibility are troublesome by the parked vehicles.

Socio-Economic Issues
In terms of socio-economic status of tourists, the
research outcomes has shown that tourists with
varied income level prefer to use distinct zones of
Atatürk Square. While tourists with middle income
mainly sit at cafes, tourists with low income prefer
to rest on a bench without purchasing. It was also
perceived that tourists with high incomes prefer to
go restaurants which has expensive prices. Within
the boundaries of a sample area, there was not any
bus stop, if people become to be more tired they can
easly take taxi, because taxi station was located in
the square. However; the prices of taxi services are
too expensive.

In the Atatürk Square, affordable facilities are
rare, so it is vital to take precautions to control
economic barriers to Kyrenia Sea Fronts’ inclusive
use. To achieve accessible tourism, strategic
transportation plans could be re-envisioned and
appropriate public transportation investments
would provide positive economic returns.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Tourism is one of the important foremost sector for
Kyrenia City, particularly existence of waterfront
create high potential to generate economic returns
from the tourism sector. Kyrenia Sea Front reflects
the characteristics of commercial, recreational and
historic waterfront and has attractive shoreline which
offers various activities for the visitors of Cyprus.
This research focused on the accessible tourism
issues for tourists with physical disabilities at
Kyrenia Sea Front. The research findings revealed
that the tourism industry is not suitably arranged
for the disabled customer market. The case study’s
evidence discloses accessibility problems which
produced by environmental barriers. Both the
physical and social environment have components
that are far from the accessible tourism
requirements. Based on the research findings;
a number of recommendations are given for
providing accessible tourism in Kyrenia Sea Front:

built environment should be designed inclusively to
all people who wants to participate facilities in the
urban waterfronts.

ABSTRACT

I

n the second half of the 20th century, the concept of sustainability came up with the claim that
social, economic and environmental needs are at risk. Till then, it aims to protect the vital resources
and values, and transfer them to the future by eliminating these risks. This approach reveals the
importance of protecting and sustaining the urban, architectural, social and cultural values of historical
textures in the context of social, economic and environmental development.
The Anatolian geography we live on has many historical textures that need to be preserved with their
traditional architecture and cultural structure. Transferring these historical textures to the future
with a sustainable conservation approach is one of the important discussion topics of conservation
discipline. Although the preferential objective of this discussion is to strengthen the subjective qualities
of our cultural heritage and to carry them to the future, the usage of these cultural areas to integrate
them with current life and to support the economic development is highly addressed. At this point,
the issue cultural tourism as a tool for cultural sustainability and economical development comes into
prominence.
In this framework, this study tries to point out the tension between preservation and economic
development by examining the impact of cultural tourism activities on heritage places through the
historical settlement of Birgi. Birgi, as an important heritage site with its qualified urban pattern,
traditional architecture and intangible cultural values, has been transforming into a cultural tourism
destination in recent years. Within this transformation process, the determination to maintain the
cultural values of the settlement and the interest in tourism activities as a means of economic development
forms the dual structure of the discussions related to the future of Birgi. In accordance with the current
discussions, the preservation studies and touristic activities had been examined; the social impact of
these activities such as the perception of the local people, the tolerance limits related to the touristic
activities and the reformation of the traditional life with the visitors was questioned, and the positive/
negative impacts of tourism in the context of sustainable preservation was discussed. As a result of all
these discussions and findings, it has been significantly noted that, although cultural tourism in heritage
places is useful by strengthening the economical and usage values of historical textures, it should only
be implemented as if it prioritizes the sustainability of the urban and architectural pattern by means of
character, meaning, arts and crafts while sustaining the local socio-cultural structure.

INTRODUCTION
The preservation and rehabilitation of historical environments is an important discussion topic of the
conservation discipline. The conservation discipline, which has been developing and expanding since the
19th century, has extended its content from the preservation of historic monuments to a holistic approach
that aims to preserve the historical texture and the environment as a whole with all natural and artificial
elements (Jokiletho, 2002). This approach foresees the preservation and continuity of cultural areas which
are defined as heritage sites with their tangible and intangible values and points out the importance of
sustainability in architectural conservation.

252

The concept of sustainability has emerged with
the awareness of social, economic and environmental
requirements are at risk. The issue of sustainability,
which has become one of the important discussion
topics of the scientific and social environments
since the half of the 20th century, aims to protect
the vital need resources and values that need to
be transferred from the present to the future by
eliminating the risks (Brundtland Report, 1983).
This approach reveals the importance of protecting
and sustaining the urban, architectural, social and
cultural values of historical textures in the context of
social, economic and environmental development.
According to the Italian architect and city
planner Cervellati, sustainable and holistic
protection can only be actualized by preserving the
community that maintains the heritage place further
to the restoration of historic buildings (Arısoy,
2014). In a similar vein, sustainable conservation
works aim to ensure the continuity of the sociocultural structure beyond the protection of objects,
and foresee that the continuity of the socio-cultural
structure should be supported by economic
development. At this point, tourism, which is one
of the important economic development tools of
the 20th century and especially the cultural tourism
activities focusing on historical, cultural and local
areas come to the fore (Ashworth, 2000).
Tourism activities that focuses on the historical
textures, enable the economic development and also
expand the awareness of these areas (Girard and
Nijkamp, 2009). On the other hand, uncontrolled
and overstain tourism activities have significant
risks for the protection of cultural heritage. Touristic
activities that will take place in historical areas,
which are important parts of our cultural heritage,
should not be an aim but a tool for sustainable
protection of the area. For this reason, the
preservation of the heritage place and the balance
between the preservation and usage should be taken
as the priority within forming a sustainable tourism
planning in historical places.
In this framework, this study tries to point out
the tension between preservation and economic
development by examining the impact of cultural
tourism activities on heritage places through the
historical settlement of Birgi. Birgi, as an important
heritage site with its qualified urban pattern,
traditional architecture and intangible cultural
values, has been transforming into a cultural
tourism destination in recent years. Within this
transformation process, the determination to
maintain the cultural values of the settlement and
the interest in tourism activities as a means of
economic development forms the dual structure

of the discussions related to the future of Birgi.
In accordance with the current discussions, the
preservation studies and touristic activities had been
examined; the social impact of these activities such
as the perception of the local people, the tolerance
limits related to the touristic activities and the
reformation of the traditional life with the visitors
was questioned, and the positive/negative impacts
of tourism in the context of sustainable preservation
was discussed.

LITERATURE REVIEW
The term sustainability is defined as meeting our
own needs without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs (Collin,
2014). By the end of the twentieth centuries,
many of these ideas had come together in the call
for sustainable development. In 1983, former
Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland
run the World Commission on Environment and
Development (Brundtland Report). After four years,
the ‘Brundtland Commission’ released its final
report, Our Common Future. It defines sustainable
development as: development that meets the needs
of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs. The
commission successfully unified environmentalism
with social and economic concerns on the world’s
development agenda. Within all these concerns, the
term sustainability met the preservation discipline
and the context of sustainable preservation
discussions was began.
According to Burra Charter (2013), the term
conservation was defined as all the processes of
looking after a place so as to retain its cultural
significance. Cultural significance was defined as
aesthetic, historic, scientific, social or spiritual value
for past, present or future generations. Cultural
significance is embodied in the place itself, its fabric,
setting, use, associations, meanings, records, related
places and related objects. This approach highlights
the multi-component issues of preservation that
consists of physical (urban, architectural, artificial
and technique), socio-cultural and economical
concerns.
Within the preservation discipline, sustainable
preservation contains variable heritage issues such
as; preservation of tangible and intangible values,
01 of rural and urban places
singular buildings, texture
and cultural landscapes. The aims of sustainable
conservation is to maintain all of these heritage
issues to the future with their aesthetic, historic,
scientific, social or spiritual value. Within this
framework and aims, economic development needs

253

to be in relation with conservation discipline in order
to strengthen the sustainability of heritage places.
The social dimension of sustainable development
emphasizes the need to improve the quality of life
for all citizens by raising base levels of material
income and by increasing social equity, such that
all groups have fair access to education, livelihood
and resources. This dimension is most relevant to
the need to consider built cultural heritage as part
of sustainable development. Of particular relevance
to this discussion is the notion of inter-generational
equity through which the current generation
preserves cultural capital (Bourdieu, 1984) for the
benefit of future generations (UNIDO, 2005)
In the context of sustainable preservation,
the continuity of the economic value and
correspondingly the continuity of socio-cultural
values have to be taken among the main objectives.
With this point of view, tourism and especially the
sustainable tourism came forward as an important
issue. Sustainable tourism is defined as a kind of
tourism activity that respects the participation of
the public, prioritizes the local concerns in policy
making and sensitive to cultural and environmental
influences (Mccoll and Moisey, 2008).
The concept of sustainable tourism remains
the subject of vigorous debate. It is variously
interpreted and its validity is questioned in many
quarters. These discussions focus on the lack of
clarity and meaning while points out the aims and
methodology. Definitions abound, to the extent that
‘defining sustainable development in the context
of tourism has become something of a cottage
industry in the academic literature of late’ (Garrod
& Fyall, 1998: 1999). Such definitions fall primarily
within two categories; those which are ‘tourismcentric’(Hunter, 1995), focusing on sustaining
tourism as an economic activity, and those which
consider tourism as an element of wider sustainable
development policies (Cronin, 1990). Sustainable
tourism has also been referred to as an ‘adaptive
paradigm’, encompassing a set of meta-principles
within which ‘several different development
pathways may be legitimized according to
circumstance’ (Hunter, 1997: 859). The main idea
that reveals the need for sustainable tourism is to
ensure that environmental and cultural values that
constitute the source of tourism are used in a longterm manner without degrading or minimizing the
negative effects that may arise. At this point, the
relationship between cultural heritage and tourism
comes forward. When considered from this point of
view, the role of tourism is significant to reach the all
aims of sustainability conservation as long as it will
be taken a tool not a goal.

254

Within the framework of these discussions,
the aim and scope of the study is to examine the
impact of sustainable tourism, which is one of the
most important tools of economic development,
on historical settlements through the historical
settlement of Birgi.

METHOD
The discipline of preservation still has doubts
about the positive and negative effects of cultural
tourism by drawing attention to the commodifying
effect of tourism activities. However, the approach
that sustainable protection can be achieved by
strengthening the place in physical, social and
economic terms reveals the positive effect of tourism
activities as being an important tool of economic
development. At this point, this study constitutes a
discussion about how to ease the tension between
preservation and tourism. With this aim, the
historical and contemporary dynamics of the place
are determined and the elements constituting the
quality of cultural heritage are defined. After then,
the preservation implementations and the touristic
activities; the perception of the local community
to these activities and their tolerance limits to the
visitors and the dynamics of new social life are
evaluated.
In this framework, firstly, a comprehensive
literature study has been conducted. With this
study, the concepts that determine the items of the
discussion, and the historical development and
cultural quality of the place have been investigated.
In order to update the data obtained from the
literature studies, field studies were conducted in
Birgi in 2019. In this context, the findings on spatial
transformation of the place were gathered through
observations and interviews, while the opinions
and the judgments of the public on conservation
and tourism activities. Within the scope of the
interviews, fifteen local people, two tradesmen, five
operators of the touristic places and the officials
of ÇEKÜL Foundation, who had an impact on the
conservation activities in Birgi, were met.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS
ON BİRGİ
Birgi is an historic settlement that located on the two
slopes of Mount Tmolos, where Gediz and Küçük
Menderes plains are separated from each other.
The region with its fertile agricultural areas and the
strategic importance by being on the transportation
networks, has been inhabited since ancient times.

Birgi has reached to a city scale at the Roman
period in the 1st century AD, though it owned the
characteristics and colors of a typical medieval city
during the Byzantine Period. In Byzantine period,
the city has assumed the function of an important
cult and religious activity center since it became the
Episcopal Center. The place undertook the function
of the administrative center of Aydınoğlu Principality
established in 1308 in Menderes Basins. With the
accession of the Sanjak of Aydın to the Ottoman
lands in 1426, the settlement which was captured
by the Ottomans, became the second largest city
of Western Anatolia. In the very beginning of 20th
century, the city faced with wars and demographic
change. As such in all over Anatolia, the people of
Birgi fought for independence during the last period
of the Ottoman Empire and kept on living under the
rule of the Republic of Turkey.
Despite the historical process of the settlement,
the greatest change in the spatial and functional
identity of Birgi took place in the 19th century.
After the construction of İzmir-Aydın Railway, it
remained outside the trade route and lost its identity
as a trade and cultural center and undertook the
function of a ‘rural charactered settlement’ whose
economy was based on agricultural production
activities. Another important threshold within the
urban history of Birgi was the first quarter of 20th
century. The city has lost some of its traditional
urban texture within the fire happened in 1922. After
then, the demolished neighborhoods were rebuilt in
accordance with the architectural understanding of
the republican period.
When the socio-economic structure of the
settlement is examined, it is possible to say that
migration movements are limited and have an
inward character in terms of social structure. This
situation affected the formaition of place identity
formation in two directions; the tarditional urban
and architectural character and the weakening of the
economy. Due to the changes in the transportation
networks of 1970’s, Birgi was enclosed and had
the chance tos tay away from the uncontroled
urbanization of 80’s. Thus, the settlement could
preserve the ‘traditional urban fabric’ and
‘architectural character’. On the other hand, due
to the weakening of the economic volume, tle
local community and especially the young people
migrated to Ödemiş and nearby cities such as
İzmir. Though the lack of internal migration and
building pressure of urbanization, many traditional
structures have been abandoned due to the loss of
users and physical degradation (Gülhan 2016).

The preservation activities, which carried out
to strengthen the inheritance of the settlement
were started by the registering a monumental
resident, (Mansion of Çakırağa) as a cultural entity.
After then, due to multilayered cultural structure,
monumental buildings and 18th century traditional
residential architecture, Birgi was registered as
an urban-archaeological-natural site in 1977 and
conservation development plan was approved in
1996. As for being an important heritage site with
its intangible values and natural environment as
well as its qualified traditional residential fabric
and monumental structures, Birgi has been chosen
as one of the self-preserving cities by the ÇEKÜL
Foundation and nominated for Unesco World
Heritage Temporary List in 2012. The conservation
activities happened in Birgi aimed to preserve and
maintain historical and cultural values. With this
aim, restoration of traditional residential buildings,
re-functional interventions related to these entities
and rehabilitation studies related to the urban
texture has been actualized.
The rehabilitation works, which came to the
forefront as an intervention method in urban
scale, started primarily in center and it’s nearby
neighborhoods such as: Cami Kebir, Kurtgazi and
Sarıbaba in 2000’s and Taspazar neighborhood
in 2019. These rehabilitation studies have made a
positive contribution to the maintenance of Birgi’s
historical urban character and strengthen the place
identity while caused to increase tourism potential in
terms of economic development. On the other hand,
restoration and re-functioning implementations
related to the traditional houses have been carrying
on in the site. The most of the traditional houses
have been renovated by refunctioning such as; cafes,
restaurants, pensions. It is possible to say that, the
new uses of historic houses was determined by the
tourism potential of Birgi that based on its historical
and cultural values.
However, these conservation implementations
and tourism activities transformed the physical and
social structure of the city center and caused a dual
life in the heritage place. Today, the city center has
been mostly used by the visitors and the local people
cannot experience this district in their daily routines.
Most of the traditional houses have lost their original
usage and transformed into service areas that are
temporarily used. Therefore, the city center which is
used above potential in01
the high season becomes subpotential other times and the locals maintain their
lives in the periphery while the visitors experiencing
the traditional local life in the center without the

255

locals. In addition, the rural life is almost dismissed
though it is one of the main goals of sustainable
preservation and also one of the tools of sustainable
tourism. It shall be appropriate to encourage the
cultivation of local agricultural products such as
figs, olive oil, potatoes, chestnuts and Japanese
persimmon by the locals and expected to contribute
to the economic development of Birgi in the context
of sustainable preservation and rural tourism.
As it has been informed above, the preservation
studies happened in Birgi have strengthened the
place and made the local community proud of their
places, while the tourism activities has increased the
awareness, strengthened the economic value of the
historic houses and helped in feeling proud of the
place. However, the perception of the locals related
to the tourists is negative. The interviews have
questioned the tolerance limits of locals, the effects of
tourism in the local life, and the contribution of new
functions to social, spatial and economic aspects.
As a result of all these negotiations, it has been
determined that as long as these activities contribute
to the economic development of the local people,
their tolerance to tourism and tourists is high. Seven
of the interviewees of local people’s opinions about
tourists were positive, since they thought tourists/
tourism in Birgi gave a chance to introduce and
sell their handmade local goods and Birgi’s local
products. However, due to the conservative nature
of the locals, this tolerance was low against to the
public houses and even they tyrannized over the
local and central administration and forced them
to terminate the activity. Five of the interviewers
of the local people’s opinions were firmly negative
about usage of public houses, since they thought
public houses affected their local life unfavourably.
Another reaction of locals is against the daily trips.
Ten of the interviewees from local people thought
that daily tours can harm their daily life as well as
their local sustainable life balance. Daily tours are
one of the main reasons of over potential usage of
Birgi and threaten the sustainable preservation
model that is taken as the priority.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
In addition to the traditional architectural
patterns, historical sites are important parts of
life as a holistic product of social, environmental
and economical inputs. In historical places that
need to be protected, renewed, revitalized and
even rehabilitated, it is necessary to adopt these
works by the local people and provide solutions
to the spatial, cultural and economic needs of the

256

users. Projects that aim a sustainable and holistic
preservation should be created with an approach
that prioritizes the continuity of the local character
and seeks to respond to the needs and expectations
of the local community. This approach points out
that tourism activities, which are the means of
economic development, should be tools rather
than goals in the rehabilitation of historical sites.
Although this approach is theoretically accepted, it
is observed that tourism planning is not prioritized
regarding historical textures. It is observed that
settlements such as Çeşme, Bodrum and Şirince,
which stand out as important tourism destinations
in addition to their historical qualities, are planned
with an approach that prioritizes the increase of
economic value and visitor expectations. With
this perspective, the re-functionalization of Birgi’s
historical buildings with appropriate usages, the
integration of new usages with traditional and rural
character of the place and the strengthening of it,
and the perception of tourism activities by the local
users of the area were evaluated.
As it is observed in Birgi, it is quite important
that the new uses of the re-functionalized historical
buildings should maintain the architectural
character of the structure. On the other hand, in
order to achieve a holistic approach, the preservation
of intangible cultural heritage values has to be
considered among the main objectives. With this
perspective, conservation activities in Birgi can be
assumed as positive in terms of the adoption of
new functions and functional predictions by the
local community. The tourism activities have been
provided the re-use of obsolete buildings as a hostel,
restaurant or café, and it also provided employment
opportunities in terms of economics. The placement
of these activities that concentrated in the historic
center and its nearby where monumental buildings
are located can be respond positively as it allows
the traditional living routines to continue in the
periphery traditional housing areas. However, these
activities have negative effect by having similar
opportunities and characteristics, and offering the
economic benefit to a limited group. This point
of view envisages the use of re-functionalized
historical structures to be in accordance with the
architectural potential and to functionalize these
buildings by main tools of cultural tourism such
as: accommodation and gastronomic activities, and
to ensure the management of these commercial
activities with a cooperative management model.
Besides, it is important to emphasize the objective
of experience in the foreseen touristic activities and
to make this experience with a view that emphasizes
the traditional and rural character of the place. For

example, instead of boutique hotels, it is possible to
encourage home boarding and to enable the visitors
to experience the local life of Birgi together with the
locals. On the other hand, limiting the possibilities
of accommodation in terms of scale and sharing
the income through a cooperative management
model will enable the usage of historical buildings
in accordance with the architectural potential of the
buildings and the appropriation of the activities by
the local society.
Another issue that emerged within the studies
is the determination of tolerance limits of locals
both for the touristic activities and the visitors. The
local community of Birgi is heavily conservative.
This makes it necessary to carefully determine
the location of new uses and options that will be
installed on the historical site. For this reason, it is
very important to determine the spatial and social
dynamics of the place within the tourism planning
of the settlement, and to define the activities in terms
of service diversity, scale, quality in accordance with
the spatial character of the heritage and the social
structure of the local community.
Consequently, it can be clarified that the
preservation and rehabilitation implementations
and the cultural tourism activities carried out in
Birgi; been positively affected the sustainability of the
traditional fabric of Birgi by establishing the balance
of protection/use of the historical settlements. By
now, tourism activities have been strengthen and
put forward the traditional, rural character of Birgi.
However, in order to sustain and strengthen the
social structure, the socio-cultural issues such as
place identity, sense of belonging and memory have
to be taken into concern in the further expectations
of Birgi.

euse of military building typologies is a relatively recent tendency in Skopje, the capital city of the
Republic of North Macedonia. As in different regions and countries around the world, especially
after the fall of the Berlin Wall and starting of the new political realities in Europe in the late 80s
and the beginning of 90ties, former socialist countries such as Macedonia and its military heritage is
becoming common part of the civil society used for various cultural purposes rather than emphasizing
the military heritage as leading stream. These former facilities that remained in a good physical condition
and applied contemporary reuse projects are being part of the new cultural networks and routes, even
promoting varieties of values of the “smart city” concept. This former military building (“Public Room”)
is located on the “cultural route”, connecting the old (The Old Town and Bazaar) and new parts of the
city. The conversion from the rigid and neglected military building typologies that are existing nearby
the former Railway Station into new cultural hubs, centers for design and innovations are offering vast
multi-layered benefits to the cultural mainstreams. With the case study of the “Public Room” building Center for Design and Innovation; cultural, social, economic, environmental, aesthetical, technological
and functional benefits are achieved not just within the building itself but on the urban levels as well.
It creates new paradigms of smart city co-creative platforms such as urban patterns that are promoting
the contemporary urban culture and cultural tourism. This paper aims to interpret how the benefits are
achieved through the applied adaptive reuse project and decision-making process in the case study of
“Public Room”; offering and promoting up-to-date multicultural activities and events to the locals and
tourists, without any bias towards political, ethnical or religious orientation.

INTRODUCTION
Buildings have always been adjusted or modified to a certain extent. Although the adaptation of buildings
is not a new procedure, their conversion to contemporary uses on a regular and larger scale is more a recent
occurrence. In the past, there was evidence of only occasional building conversions starting up from the
Roman era up to the late Medieval period, whereas between the 16th and 19th centuries conversions and
other forms of adaptive reuse approaches became more common (Cunnington, 1988).
Nowadays, even though many existing typologies including the industrial/military buildings that are
potentially still in good physical/structural quality, unfortunately, they are redundant or neglected due to
various influential factors (Gregg and Crosbie, 2001). It would be a loss of valuable built assets to destroy
such structures because demolition is itself a non-economic, wasteful, hazardous, polluting, disruptive
and costly process (Douglas, 2006). Adaptive reuse of military buildings as part of the industrial building
heritage in the cities received a lot of attention in the previous century especially after II. World War and
changings of the political systems in Europe and worldwide. The redevelopments and reuse of abandoned
industrial sites and buildings, which are often located in the core sections of urban areas, have huge potential
to improve quality of life in different manners in the cities (Li, H & Lui, W, 2013).
The industrial heritage (warehouses, factories, gas-stations, mills, railway stations) is becoming more
suitable to host various uses that are matching the contemporary way of living, such as art galleries, design
& cultural centers, offices, theaters, etc. Moreover, their building characteristics and spatial volumes, the
legislation and by-laws are allowing designers to have freedom in the context of importing different use,
concepts and functions. Usually, conversions to other uses are more attractive than same-use conversions.
The new use may involve minimal spatial, interior and functional requirements that are not differing
much from the original. Usually, this building typology requires structural and interior modifications so to
accommodate the changes easily (Douglas, 2006).

258

These reuses and changes of the industrial heritage buildings covers another aspect of urban
developments, especially in the domain of the mainstream culture today: the “creative cities” concept. As
Harrison and Donnelly are going to emphasize in their significant essay about the theory of smart cities by
analyzing recent developments and changes:
ićFTF DIBMMFOHFT MFBE UP FYQFSJNFOUT XJUI OFX BQQSPBDIFT UP UIF QMBOOJOH  EFTJHO  ĕOBODF 
construction, governance, and operation of urban infrastructure and services that Smart Cities are
broadly called”. (Harrison & Donnelly, 2011)
In the case of Skopje, this prism is becoming possible after starting with the steps for creating National
Strategies on Creative Industries (Creative Industries Mapping in the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje, 2016)
that was initiated and performed basically by the Ministry of Culture. On one side, this explains the level
of institutionalized influence in the process but on the other side it is not limiting the creative potential
that influences the recent culture and art production, but instead promoting art and culture as basic hubs
for collecting creative potential that participates in the concept of the city creativity, cultural networks
development, and cultural routes definition. In this context, the same point of “smart cities” appears to
influence tourism, cultural tourism, adaptive reuse of heritage buildings and many other forms of creative
existence on an urban scale.
Many other examples confirm a tendency of recognition of the cultural, thus promotional and touristic
potential of these buildings typologies. As stressed in detail in the PSFK platform – (The Future of cities,
2013) they even elaborate recent trends, which are responsible for the sustainable growth and effective
management of the smart cities as they respond to the exceptional challenges by the rapid urbanization.
These trends are mostly,
“aided by connected technologies, social platforms, and flexible design thinking, cities at the forefront
of these progressive solutions are creating a compelling blueprint for ensuring that their citizens, businesses
and public institutions thrive” (PSFK- The Future of cities, 2013).
Some of the emphasized values and topics coming from the above-mentioned report coincide with the
main topic of this research and presentation of the case study of “Public Room”, such as pop-up culture,
creative clusters, urban canvas, artistic endeavors (PSFK- The Future of cities, 2013)1.
With this approach, it is possible to reach to the point to ask questions such as: Who does the city work
for? What the emergent and creative third places are in cities? How do future scenarios of cities seduce
policymakers, decision-makers, planners, and designers? How does the complex decision making process
is provided? (Tsakarestou, 2013)
Possible answers are again leading the traces back to creativeness, reuse, co-creation, urban patterns
and cultures, tourism developments, city branding…

LITERATURE REVIEW: DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN ADAPTIVE
REUSE
Particularly in the adaptive reuse field, development and decision-making process, many professionals from
both the public and private sectors are required to ensure that all of the necessary elements are coordinated
and the tasks are completed. Because of their specific roles, expertise, and backgrounds, the stakeholders
naturally approach the adaptive reuse process differently, with different ideas, strategies, and methods than
the experts (Bond, 2011). Adaptive reuse process of industrial/military building typologies reflects with
complexity, creativity, design thinking, co-creative, and collaborative planning which includes involvement
of various factors, strategies, and approaches such as:- stakeholders(building owners, authorities, planers,
institutions, companies, communities, etc.);
1

POP-UP CULTURE: “Architects and planners are experimenting with temporary venues designed to be quickly deployed and
assembled to host temporary events like performances and films. These flash experiences connect with an ever changing
01
audience, while highlighting locally sourced content and bringing cultural enrichment into people’s lives”.
CREATIVE CLUSTERS: “As a way to breathe life back into forgotten corners of a city, there has been a renewed push to develop
an artistic and cultural infrastructure like galleries, studios and workshops within transitional neighborhoods. By highlighting
educational programming and creative self-expression, these grassroots efforts seek to build a strong anchor for the surrounding
community that is attractive to both residents and visitors. As these areas establish themselves as destinations, they open the
door for further social and business ventures, adding to the collective benefit of a place”.
URBAN CANVAS: “Artistic endeavors and considered redevelopments that make the city landscape feel more vibrant and
alluring, while engaging citizens around shared experiences and conversations”.

Furthermore, by applying these important
steps of adaptive reuse decision-making process,
the final result and the new uses, functions for
existing industrial / military structures could
be advantageous from many aspects such as: its
function, users, the building itself (aesthetics,
maintenance and protection) and on urban levels as
well (Mine,2013). Most common benefits that could
eventually come from the properly applied adaptive
reuse strategies and decision-making process
can be categorized as cultural, social, economic,
environmental, technologic, functional, and
aesthetic benefits common for both communities
and the city (Johnson, 1996).

Former Military Heritage in Skopje
After the fall of Yugoslavia in 1991, in R. N.
Macedonia as a former socialist country, many
military and industrial facilities remained
abandoned. In Skopje, especially in the central
zone near the former Railway station (existing
before the devastating Earthquake in 1963, today
functioning as Skopje City Museum) that was
from enormous importance for the economic and
industrial development for the country and the
capital city, many warehouses and storage facilities
built between 1919-1936 stayed in good structural

260

condition (Multimedia centre “Mala Stanica” –
National Gallery of Macedonia, n.d.).See Fig.1.The
structural qualities and capacities of these facilities
are not prone to premature physical obsolescence
due to the durability of the construction made for
industrial and military purposes.
To some of the buildings were given the
purposes of the Ministry of Defense to be used for,
yet some of them were completely demolished and
some remained locked, empty and neglected. In the
recent decade, these typologies of buildings became
attractive topics for experts to open discussions
and debates (since they were not used actively and
sufficiently) about their possible future reuse and
creation of new cultural routes, connecting the old
and new parts of the city so to contribute into the
cultural and urban life of Skopje. One of the military
warehouses located the nearby left side of the
building Public Room(See Fig.1)is one of the initial
reuse projects that were applied to this typology of
buildings and today successfully is functioning as
part of the National Gallery Network of Macedonia,
as “Multimedia and Cultural center, Mala Stanica”.

Research Process
In that sense, the main objective and research
question of this paper is to present and show how
multi-layered benefits are achieved through the
new contemporary reuse approaches applied on
the former military building facility, today socalled “Public Room”. Moreover, this research aims
to examine how the reuse strategies and project
influences and improves the urban context through
the proposed program and gives irreplaceable and
up-to-date values to the city. The methodology that
will be used in this research will be qualitative and
presented through a purposeful selection of a case
study (Public Room) through applied adaptive reuse
project presented from its earlier conceptual stages
up to its final executive stages and decision-making
process.
Furthermore, the data collection was provided
through personal analysis and observations, archive
research, applied the decision-making process of the
project, interviews with experts and stakeholders
and final results. With this article the focus stays
only on the decision-making process of the case of
Public Room (Center for Design and Innovation);
the achieved benefits and will not elaborate other
industrial or military facilities that are part of the
urban cultural network of the city.

EARLIER CONDITION
The former military building located nearby the Former Railway Station (today Skopje City Museum) socalled “Vardar”, was initially constructed in 1921, functioning as a military stable during the period between
the two World Wars. Later on, according to the needs of the military, it was used as warehouse storage
together with an administrative part in the ground floor. The structural system is made from reinforced
concrete (columns and beams) and remained in good structural condition (Josole Engineering, 2015). The
building has a total capacity of 1440 square meters and has ground floor, first floor, and attic.
Moreover, in recent years the facility owned by Ministry of Defense, unfortunately, remained in derelict
condition (interior-floor, walls, stairs and exterior-façade – not renewed and full with graffiti, openings,
chimneys, roof, details and ornamentation, accessibility), used only for minor administrative purposes only
in the ground floor (See Figure 2-3). The pitched wooden roof structure stayed in critical condition as well;
wooden beams (roof construction) are slightly damaged and needs to be replaced/strengthened. The roof
construction was to be replaced to be able to hold heavier weights in the future such as solar panels so to
enable energy efficiency of the building. Another problem with the attic is that the existing roof structure
is not providing any natural ventilation/light. For that purpose, restructuring and consolidation of the roof
had to be considered.

Public Room Organization

01

Public Room is an active non-governmental organization and non-profit civil and urban society organization
in R. N. Macedonia, Balkan region and beyond. The activities and the program they are providing to the
community is to empower the non-profit sector from the region, influencing the national cultural policies
and intensifying the cooperation in the field of culture, arts, design, and architecture in relation with the
business sector. Public Room exists as a non-profit organization from 2007 while producing the most
tangible results from 2008 in the focus sector – Design (URL 1).

4th International Tourism Congress

From that year till present the organization is hosting and organizing the most important event in the
cultural domain such as “Skopje Design Week”, in the historical building – “Kurshumli Han” in the Old
Town of Skopje (See Figure 4-5). Moreover, this organization has organized various international exchanges
and presentations, production workshops, training, and management courses in the field of design.

Requirements and Program
As popular NGO and non-profit organization in Skopje, in 2014, Public Room required new space /
building (with previously estimated location and spatial characteristics) that will respond to the needs for
creating new a Center for Design and Innovation and organizing Skopje Design Week in a new facility that
will actively contribute to the community with its urban and cultural profile as well.
The program of the new Center for Design and Innovation has consisted oflobby and reception
desk,restaurant (bistro) and bar,kitchen and storages,prototyping roomwith separate entrance for supplying
and delivering goods with truck (wood department, metal department, upholstery department, modeling
department and storage, separated but still to be visible for visitors from the restaurant and bar area).
Moreover,toilet units,multifunctional spacesto host various types of events such as seminars, workshops,
presentations, screenings, debates, exhibitions, public and private events;concept store + shopping
room,private roomwith small bar and kitchenette,open room,administrative zonewith advertisement
agencies, working stations, design studios etc. (Velinovski, 2014). These requirements are given to the
stakeholders and expert’s team (architects, engineers) as well as a conceptual design program to be able
to fit in the existing military heritage building to be converted into a new center in Skopje for Design and
Innovation. Furthermore, in the next chapter, the decision-making process of conversion and adaptation of
the building will be explained.

Decision-making Process (conceptual and executive stages)
The building “Vardar” located on the “50th Division” street is governed by Ministry of Defense (previously
used as storage and administration for the military purposes, but not sufficiently used and neglected). Due
to the lack of use and poor conditions of the building, after major analysis of the space and estimation
from authorities, stakeholders and experts (evaluation of the existing physical condition, documentation,
measuring and drawing, preparation of a conceptual project), the Public Room organization find the
building suitable to host the appropriate program.
The conceptual project of the facility was presented by Public Room organization to the Ministry of
Defense and Ministry of Culture. The project showed the design program and possibilities and benefits
from reuse of the facility in the domain of cultural industries of the city. According to the national strategies
of the Ministry of Culture for promoting the awareness in the design sector in Macedonia and the region,
the Ministry of Defense in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture and Government of Macedonia

262

approved its reuse and it transferred the ownership
of the facility to the Public Room organization for
cultural activities purposes and maintenance for the
period of 20 years (Vecer, 2015). The support of the
Ministry of Culture will allow future development
of the creative industries together with the business
sector of the country.
When it comes to the legislation and regulations
in the further design process, there is no strict
protection that especially applied to the building
and it is not categorized as an important industrial
heritage of the city. In collaboration with experts and
authorities, it was decided that the facility should
preserve the original envelope with possible minor
additions such as shading elements and definition
of the entrance, changes of the openings and color
of the façade.
After finalizing the decision process of the
conceptual project, it was continued to the execution
of the project in two phases. The first phase was
about providing: structural reinforcement on the
roof and repair work on façade, openings (new),
additions (shading elements, entrance definition stairs), painting, floor replacement, stairs (interiorexterior) changes in the inner division, lightning,
HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning),
electricity. Due to the lack of finances, the second
phase was executed later on including structural
reinforcement and replacement on the roof and
roof floor, in order the attic space to be used for
advertisement agencies, working stations, design
studios and administrative purposes of the facility.
In the second phase the interior design of the
conceptual store, the prototyping room, and the
meeting rooms were executed as well.
After a long and complex decision-making
process of negotiations and approvals with
authorities, stakeholders and experts (interior
designers, architects, engineers), conceptual and
executive phases of the project were finalized. After
the period of one year, the adaptive reuse project
was completed on 28 October 2015.
The significant opening of the new Center for
Design and Innovation – Public Room, marked a
new beginning of the urban and cultural activities
that will be supported by the regional Balkan Design
Network and European Union. In the next chapter, a
new condition of the facility, its offer to the citizens
and designers and its benefits will be presented.

PUBLIC ROOM NEW
CONDITION
After the long and complex decision-making process,
today the new center for design and innovation is
offering various urban events, happenings in the
cultural and design domain such as: free co-working
spaces for freelancers, concept store, prototyping
room, library, commercial bazaars, fine arts and
photo exhibitions, seminars, workshops and creative
courses for children and adults, business meetings,
presentations and celebrations.
Public Room is a pure hybrid and multifunctional
place that offers realization of ideas, open and
friendly access to the public, local and international
companies, organizations or individuals. Moreover,
the new condition of the building is promoting
leisure activities like local and international cuisine,
mezze bar, live music and DJ performances (New
Center for Design and Innovation - Public Room,
Skopje, 2015).
The improved new condition of the building is
both in the exterior and interior. In the exterior, it is
possible to witness from some parts on the façade the
previous condition and function by the emphasized
structural system with grey color and the details
with the hooks (that served for caring the heavy
objects). The contrasting contemporary touches
on the façade are the wide openings on the ground
floor as well as the shading element and stairs for
the definition of the main entrance (see Figure 6).
The interior design reflects with the same attitude:
the structural elements (columns and beams) from
the previous condition are visible and clear. The new
additions, the furniture, and fixture are reflecting the
contemporary and urban living of the 21st century.
Furthermore, the interior design enables working
spaces for group/team or individual works.
The constant and active use of the facility (interior
and exterior), by locals and foreign visitors, is a
proof that the new condition and offered program/
management are successful in many aspects (see
Figure 7). In other words Public Room completely
resembles as apop-up culture(hosting temporary
performances and bringing cultural enrichment
into people’s lives),cultural cluster(breaths life
back into forgotten corner of the city) orurban
canvas(engaging
citizens
through
shared
experiences, platforms, gastronomic events, co01
creative spaces and conversations) in the city. In the
next chapter, the results and the achieved benefits
for the reuse project will be elaborated.

Results and Benefits
As a result, the achieved benefits from the reuse project are evaluated on a micro (unit) scale and macro
(urban) scale (See Table 1). The benefits are categorized as:cultural(unit scale: gastronomic events, hosting
design week and various exhibitions, promoting local and international events in the cultural domain;
urban scale: pop-up culture, cultural cluster, urban canvas, cultural route, cultural tourism)social(unit
scale: offering various events for the citizens and visitors (all ages), co-working spaces, raising community
awareness, organizing Skopje Design Week; urban scale: attracting local and foreign visitors, presenting the
urban culture of the city and the region, preserving the collective memory),economical(unit scale: renting
the spaces, buying designer products from concept store, bar and restaurant; urban scale: reduced costs for
materials and transportation, no rent to pay to the authorities),environmental(unit scale: saving energy from
new systems applied; urban scale: no demolition, reduced pollution),functional(unit scale: multifunctional
spaces with sub-functions; urban scale: connected into a cultural route with surrounding facilities in the
cultural domain),technological(unit scale: new innovations and designs, new systems implemented; urban
scale: improving the context by presenting new technologies in the field of design),aesthetical(unit scale:
new façade that still reflects the previous condition, contemporary and urban interior design; urban scale:

CONCLUSION
As a summary, it is possible to conclude that the adaptive reuse of industrial/military building heritage no
matter their location can bring back life in a forgotten corner of the city and be invaluable and beneficial
for the structure itself and many other aspects. Even though the reuse strategies/projects, depends on the
complex, long-term decision-making process by involving various influential factors (locals needs, expert’s
opinions, administrative and authorities approvals, stakeholders, managers) it will not allow premature
redundancy or obsolescence of the existing heritage structures. Instead, they will extend their life and
continue to contribute to the communities, preserving the collective memory and showing the need for a
smart update that will easily accommodate the rapid changes in the urban developments.
Moreover, properly applied adaptive reuse projects will result with multi-layered benefits (cultural,
social, economic, environmental, technological, functional and aesthetical) on the unit scale and urban
scale as well. The case of Public Room in Skopje is an successful example of a military building typology
that was converted into a new Center for Design and Innovation bringing above all cultural benefits, popup culture, urban, smart and contemporary content to the city of Skopje offering to the citizens and visitors
many new events in the field of design and cultural enrichment.

ABSTRACT

S

tructural changes that began to be observed in the global economy in the 1970s and neo-liberal
economic policies moving towards developing countries from developed countries have led to
changes in employment patterns. In Turkey, neoliberal political-economic has been the main
determinant with January 24, 1980 Decrees. The reflections of these policies on the tourism industry
are shaped by the Tourism Encouragement Law No. 2634 published in 1982. As a result, tourism
investments and employment have increased significantly. However, precarization of labour as a result
of the influence of neoliberal policies has led to the emergence of a new social class which is called
the Precariat in Standing (2012)’s framework. Precariat is an emerging mass class, characterized by
inequality and insecurity. These practices grouped under the terms of atypical, nonstandard, marginal
and unstable employment such as semi-permanent positions, fixed-term employment contracts, shortterm employment (until the end of the work) and working in multiple jobs. Especially, it can be said
that this type of work is common in the tourism sector where flexible work is seen. This study aims to
describe the development of tourism precariat and its structural features in Turkey. According to the
findings, three types of structural employment identified in tourism enterprises. These forms are; (1)
permanent, (2) seasonal and (3) one-day employment. It can be seen that in the form of permanent
employment, legal rights can be partly exploited and that the precariousness in the forms of seasonal
and one-day employment is observed at a high level. It can be said that there is a tourism precariat which
does not have trade union memberships in general and which lacks many basic rights and employed
precariously. These findings overlap with the structural features of the precariat defined by Standing.

INTRODUCTION
The conventional distinction between work and home emerged through the process of industrialization.
The proletariat worked in places such as factories and mines, which the capitalist defined as the workplace,
and then returned to their homes. Recent days, even though the conventional distinction between work
and home continues, transformations have begun (Standing, 2011: 199). Within this process, a concept
called precarization began to attract attention. x and y were evaluated among the leading indicators of
precarization. Flexible labour contracts, temporary jobs, labour as casuals, part-timers, or intermittently for
labour brokers or employment agencies were widely evaluated as the prominent determiners of precarization
(Standing, 2014b). Standing (2011) than coined the term ‘precariat’ and defines this phenomenon as a ‘new
dangerous class’. According to him (2011: 20-21), the precariat is deprived of rights which proletariat has,
such as stable, long term and fixed-time work, trade union rights and, collective agreements. They are not
even the middle class because they do not have a fixed salary, status or basic rights. These people are in a
precarious situation and have no job security.
Four developments have had an impact on the growth of global precariat. The first of these is the spread of
01 some of them were pushed
women’s labour in the labour market. Thus, the value of male labour decreased and
out of the labour market. The second is the re-entry of the third age into the labour market. Because the elderly
who do not have enough money, prefer to join the labour force. Third, a significant number of adults have
disability status. These people, of course, those who can be able to work, try to be recruited and most of them
are employed in precarious jobs. Finally, it can be considered that for any reason, persons involved in crime are
joined to the precarious army by being pushed out of employment (Standing, 2011: 154).

The economic recession following the 2008
global crisis paved the way for decreasing the
number of full-time workers and the temporary
employment of more people. (Standing, 2011: 65). In
Turkey, until 2018, a portion of public employees in
the status of contract workers were employed longterm, some of them were employed temporarily.
In 2018, with a regulation made in the law, longterm subcontracted workers were transferred to
tenure track as 4/D workers in state enterprises.
Although it is an important step for the work and
life security of public workers in state enterprises,
the employment of temporary workers for three
months continues in various ways. It is not possible
to realize this development for the private sector
as a result of market pressure under the following
conditions. Because the trend of flexible working in
the world is spreading.
Today, businesses are looking for ways to
eliminate the problems caused by ‘routine’ by
creating more flexible structures (Sennett, 2013). In
addition to the increase in informal employment,
flexible employment increased the employment
rate of women. However, it weakened the organized
labour movement (Aykaç, 2009: 42). This is one of
the practices that bring the exploitation of labour
to a higher level. The tourism sector is one of
the branches of business where flexible working
practices are seen intensively. Part-time work
and seasonal work are examples of these types of
practices. Especially for the employee, precarity has
negative effects on career and wages.
In this study, it is aimed to show the employment
forms and conditions of the tourism workers and the
difficulties they are dealing with. For this purpose,
some answers have been tried to be formed for
these basic problems and sub-problems. The related
answers were tried to be described with the findings.

THE CONCEPT OF PRECARIAT
The term precariat is coined by Standing (2011) as
a social class. The term is obtained by combining
the words ‘precarious’ and ‘proletariat’. The precariat
consists of people living through insecure jobs
interspersed with periods of unemployment or
labour-force withdrawal (misnamed as ‘economic
inactivity’) and living insecurely, with uncertain
access to housing and public resources. They
experience a constant sense of transiency (Standing,
2014a: 21).
According to Standing (Standing, 2011: 107),
almost ‘everyone’ is a potential precariat. When we
lose our assurances in the event of an accident or a
crisis, we can become a member of the precariat. It can

268

be said that in the public service are noticeably better
but especially for the private sector, precarity is likely
to happen. Precarization affects the exposed person
deeply; blurs the future and prevents expectations for
a rational future (Bourdieu, 2017: 109).
Temporary forms of employment have cost
advantages for enterprises. Because low wages reduce
risks (Standing, 2011: 61). The flexible workplace
consciously exploits the situation of job insecurity,
which contributes to its strengthening. The goal of
reducing costs is made possible by constantly leaving
the employee at risk of losing his job (Bourdieu,
2017: 110). The reason for this is the contracts that
provide the ease of layoff a temporarily hired person
for any reason. These contracts are legally granted
to enterprises. The reduced rights of workers reduce
the value of labour, which is already the biggest cost
element in the hospitality sector. Thus, the capital
makes more profit, but also leads to the exploitation
of labour. This makes it easier to control temporary
workers through fear. If they do not fulfil the
demands of management, their dismissal is only a
matter of time (Standing, 2011: 61).
Just as in many European countries today,
when the unemployment rate is very high and
precarization affects the majority of the population
-including workers, industry and trade employees,
journalists, teachers, students etc.-, work becomes
rare and desirable at any cost. This leaves the
employees at the mercy of the employer so that the
employer not only use this power as witnessed every
day but also abuses it (Bourdieu, 2017: 111).
In one aspect, this can be accepted as one of
the domination practices that are encountered in
working life. The domination form described above
consists of two parts. The first of these is the state
and the second is the enterprises. First, the state
allows temporary employment through the legal
rights it provides. Thus, it protects the employer
through contracts (made between employer
and employee). Hence, the enterprise with a low
contract termination cost does not hesitate to
layoff it’s employees. Besides, high unemployment
rates strengthen the employer’s hand. The worker
who faced with the danger of layoff inadvertently
accepts the exploitation. Thus, the competition
in the recruitment stage is continuing with the
competition in maintaining the job owned. This is
a kind of competitive reaction to protect the job
at all costs against the layoff blackmail, which is
sometimes confronted in the workplace. At this
point, it can be interpreted that precarization is a
new form of dominance, which aims to establish a
continuous situation of insecurity that will compel
workers to obey and accept exploitation (Bourdieu,
2017: 113).

Unemployed people endure additional costs in
job search and training processes. After working
temporarily, they are trapped in precarity. There is
low profit and no professional loyalty, and there is
no stability in the use of time (Standing, 2011: 89217). In this study, this condition is accepted as a
contemporary problem in labour market employed
in the tourism sector. For this reason, the frame
of this phenomenon was tried to be drawn in the
context of Eskişehir.

METHOD
In this research, a qualitative method was used to
obtain in-depth inferences. Face-to-face interview
technique was used to collect data. The interview is
the most commonly used data collection technique
in qualitative research (Yıldırım and Şimşek, 2011:
147). Also, it is a technique in which questions are
asked for the purposes that are important for the
researcher (Glesne, 2014: 140-141). In this technique,
the researcher can obtain more in-depth findings
with the question of ‘how?’ rather than ‘what? or how
much?’ (Büyüköztürk et al., 2014: 240).
The data obtained through face-to-face
interviews with employees in hotels in Eskişehir.
31 hotels which are operating in Eskişehir were
included in the research. This data obtained from
the Governorship of Eskisehir in July 2018. The
distribution of accommodation enterprises which
was certified by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism
has presented in Table 1.

To obtain in-depth findings for the research,
7 semi-structured question was prepared. Semistructured questions provide both direct answers
and in-depth inquiry in the relevant field. At the
same time, it has advantages such as providing

convenience in analysis and allowing the participant
to express her/himself as s/he wishes (Büyüköztürk
et al., 2014: 152). Expert opinions were obtained
from two researchers to check the content validity
of the questions. Necessary corrections were made
after expert opinions.
After the interviews, the records were deciphered
and turned into text. Subsequently, the data analysis
phase was initiated. In this research, interview texts
were analysed with the content analysis technique.
Content analysis is a qualitative data analysis
technique that provides access to concepts and
relationships that can explain the collected data.
It is aimed to identify the data through content
analysis and reveal the facts that may be hidden in it
(Yıldırım and Şimşek, 2013: 259). At this stage, the
codes and themes that make sense for the research
were obtained from the data collected.
The credibility of the research is accepted as one
of the most important criteria of scientific research
(Creswell, 2014). In this context, the following steps
were taken to increase the credibility of the research:
t -POHUFSNŔOUFSBDUŔPO At the beginning, the

The researchers contacted the participants
by telephone to explain the content of the study
and explained the interview questions before the
interview. The interviews were conducted by the
researchers between July 26, 2018 and August 7, 2018
with five participants. Participants were informed
about audio recording during the interview. All
participants responded positively to the audio
recording during the interview. Throughout the
interview, statements 01

FINDINGS
In this study, which is designed to understand the forms of employment in hotel enterprises and to describe
the situation of employees, the data analysis is based on the concept of precariat. The forms of employment
used by the enterprises are divided into three as daily, seasonal and long-term.
The high unemployment rates in Turkey, creating pressure on employees, hence, enables enterprises
to reach labour at low costs. Unemployment pressure is the driving force behind hard work in order not
to lose their jobs but also allows them to accept low wages. This is an opportunity for businesses, and they
do not hesitate to use this mechanism. In this way, it can be said that also the state has to play a role, albeit
indirectly, in the exploitation of workers. Because workers’ rights cannot be protected at a level that can
eliminate precarity.
Kemal: ‘Obligatory… Unemployment dragged me here. We did not know this aspect of the tourism
sector, hence we entered with peace of mind. But… I never stop, I’m looking for alternative jobs now. I
am dragging my feet in workdays. Not only I, 80% of all hotel staff thinks so.’
It is seen that the severance payments which are the legal right of the employees are not given. In order
to avoid severance, pay, hotel businesses apply various kinds of pressure on employees and force them
to resign. It should be mentioned that the hotel staff are in a total precarious position at this point. The
statements of the participants are as follows.

It is seen that the workers in the hotels in Eskişehir are working precariously, there is a high employee
turnover rate, and the managers also get used to this situation. The hotel staff stated that they did not see a
future in the hospitality industry because they did not have any guarantees on job security. The statements
of the participants are as follows:

in the profession, because, this profession, actually, is not a profession, at all. I think being a bellboy is
a job for the swaggies, frankly. I don’t work in a place like Eskişehir, relying on the tip. I have no job
security, and also I see no future.’

270

Although the hotel employees do not belong
to any labour union, they do not know that there
are labour unions in tourism, hospitality or travel
sectors. When the employees were asked whether
the company would create a problem in the issue of
labour union membership, it was stated that those
who applied to the labour union in the past were
faced layoff. The statements of the participants are
as follows:

us. We didn’t think much about it either. Or
rather, we didn’t think of it, at all.
Uğur: When I look at the current situation,
actually it is more advantageous to be
a civil servant compared to the private
sector. One of them has job security unless
you commit a disgraceful crime. But in
the private sector, there is no job security.

industry, and the public sector seems to be

trade union, so it - the private sector- remains
precarious. So, he can’t apply, if he does, he’s
gonna go to court. Also, there is a shortage of
livelihoods.
Temporary / flexible working methods provide
cost advantages to enterprises. Because, while the
wages of temporary workers are low, enterprises get
a cost advantage in employment when they employ
workers according to the workload. This practice,
which is very profitable for businesses, means
labour exploitation for employees. Temporary
workers cannot benefit from social benefits such as
severance pay because they are employed on a daily,
seasonal basis. They are easy to layoff when they
make a mistake or show resistance to exploitation.
This puts pressure on temporary workers.
Temporary workers, who do not have a chance to
pursue a career, have to do jobs that are ordered.
Thus, it can be said that they work for peanuts. The
state has a significant influence on this. Inadequacy
in legal regulation and supervision increases the
exploitation in enterprises.

CONCLUSION
Precarization shows its presence in the tourism sector
as observed in the general public. It is particularly
high in the coastal tourism enterprises that provide
seasonal services. In this study, precarization in
hotel enterprises in Eskişehir is discussed. During
the interviews, precarious practices were found,
although at a lower level compared to seasonal
destinations. The only reason for this is that the
hotels in Eskişehir operate 365 days a year and
there are no large fluctuations in demand. Hence,
the seasonal employment form is not very common
in Eskişehir. However, as a result of interviews and
observations, it was determined that the turnover
rates were high. The fact that the student population
in Eskişehir is more than job supply strengthens the
hand of enterprises; allows the managers to dismiss
the employee who claims his rights or exhibit
resistance to improper practices. Because there is a
reserve army with their diplomas or their training,
who are waiting for jobs (Bourdiue, 2017: 109).
During the busy periods in Eskişehir, it has seen
that there are daily forms of employment, which
have expressed as ‘extra’. Especially in the service
department of the hotels, it has observed that the
waiters or pages have employed on a daily basis and
that no insurance payment has made. This is the most
concrete case of flexible/temporary employment,
which is the foremost feature of precarization.
Personnel expenses, which are the most important
cost element in hotels, have been reduced through
flexible employment pools (Sennett, 2013) created
under the name of extra.
Employees who are anxious about the layoff and
working under precarious circumstances cannot
exhibit resistance. One of the main reasons for
this is the lack of unionization. Because employees
are unaware of the existence of labour unions in
tourism, hospitality and travel sectors. Employees
can neither claim their rights nor look with hope
for the future. Being able to work in a job is shown
as almost a privilege for the precariat (Bourdieu,
2017: 109-110). Because several assurances that
the employee can lean his back have disappeared
(Standing, 2011).

ABSTRACT

M

ardin has become an indispensable route for cultural tours, especially in Southeastern
Anatolia in recent years. Considering the tourism potential of Mardin, It can be said that
the tourism attractiveness of city is composed of different kinds of components pertaining
to Mardin Old City and the provinces around Mardin as well. In the present study, it is attempted to
evaluate the walkability of Mardin Old City from the tourists’ perspectives. The data of the study were
collected by applying a face to face questionnaire from tourists who had walked in Mardin Old City. The
survey was conducted in March and April 2019, and 480 valid questionnaires were obtained through
using survey. Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis of the obtained data. The study concludes
with the discussions and suggestions made in the light of the data obtained from the research.

INTRODUCTION
Walking is an important factor in increasing social recognition of healthier, environmentally friendly and
active communities (Moura vd., 2017). Walkability is a multi-dimensional concept that often determines
the degree to which any environment is walkable and at the same time is pedestrian-friendly (Hall & Ram,
2018). Certain discussions of walkability are generally made on several elements or conditions such as
traversable, compact, physically attractive areas and safe that provide walking (Forsyth, 2015). The concept
of walking is considered as a multi-disciplinary research area which is evaluated from different perspectives
(Hall vd., 2018). In this context, previous studies dealing with the concept of walkability have been examined
under different disciplines such as architecture, public health, transportation and urban design (Henderson,
2018). The issue of walkability is very important for tourist destinations.
Given that the studies in the current literature regarding the concept of walkability in touristic
destinations it is seen that more than one factors determining the walkability of any tourist destination. In
their study, Gorrini and Bertini (2018), demonstrated that the walkability level of the Venice destination
is shaped by many components. According to this; the lack of basic services, the presence of mass tourism
flow and the lack of road signs were found to be significant determinant factors. It can also be said that the
concept of walkability represents an important component in terms of creating value and satisfaction levels
for tourist destinations (Küpers & Wee, 2018). The aim of the present research is to explore that to what
extent Mardin is walkable for visitors along with examining factors affecting the walkability of tourists who
01
visited the old city of Mardin.

LITERATURE REVIEW
In the relevant literature, there are several studies
that were conducted to measure the walkability of
touristic destinations. Findings derived from these
studies revealed that there are several different
determinants of the walkability concept. In other
words, it was observed that any touristic destination
was formed around more than one variable/factor
rather than a single criterion in determining the
quality of walkability. In this sense, given that
the existing relevant literature Walk Score index
method is one of the commonly adopted methods
in walkability analysis (Ram & Hall, 2018a).
Arslan, Durak, Gebesce, and Balcik (2018)
conducted a research in Bursa by using both
qualitative and quantiative surveys to pedestrians
within the context of walkability assessment. Based
on 200 quantitative surveys that were applied to
pedestrians the authors found accessibility, comfort
and use, environmental aesthetics, safety and
security and connectivity as the most important
factors affecting walkability.
By analyzing visitors’ reviews on TripAdvisor
Hall and Ram (2018) conducted a study examining
the most important attractions in the UK in the
context of the relationship between walkability and
successful tourism indicators shaped by the number
of visitors. In the study Walk Score® index has been
utilized to measure walkability. In their study, the
authors concluded that there is a weak relationship
between walkability and visitor numbers for the top
330 tourist attractions in the UK and the number
of walkability and TripAdvisor ratings. Besides,
although there was a weak relationship between
walkability and TripAdvisor ranking, no significant
relationship was found between the attractions of
the city.
By employing a mixed-method approach, Ujang
ve Muslim (2014) carried out a study in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia. In the study, the authors found
connectivity, comfort, feeling while walking, safety,
attractiveness and pleasantness as the most valuable
components of the walkability. Similarly, Mansouri
ve Ujang (2016) implemented research in Kuala
Lumpur through using a questionnaire survey that
was distributed to 330 tourists walking in the city.
The research revealed that accessibility, connectivity
and continuity yürünebilirlik were significant
indicators in the formation of expectation and
satisfaction in terms of walkability.
By employing principal component analysis,
Samarasekara, Fukahori ve Kubota (2011)
established six walkability dimensions that have
influence on determining walking decisions namely

274

safety from traffic, the comfort of walking area,
environmental appearance, activity potential, shade
and exploration.
In another study which was conducted in Istanbul
by Gören and Santinha (2017), it was examined that
the components of accessibility and mobility in
terms of walkability from tourists’ perspectives. The
result of the study is that there are some important
problems in urban planning. Moreover, it has been
found that there are connection problems with the
places which are connected with the routes and have
some important tourist attractions and in some
cases, the pedestrian crossings do not allow the
continuation of the walking paths.

area where the research was conducted, the scale
used as a data collection tool, and other information
about the population and sample of the research.

STUDY AREA
With its several natural and cultural attractiveness,
Mardin is known as one of the most most important
cultural destinations of Turkey for both domestic
and foreign visitors (Atsız & Kızılırmak, 2017). It
attracts a large number of tourists in the region,
as it contains many different kinds of beliefs and
worship centers belonging to different beliefs and
cultures and possesses the characteristics of cultural
heritage (Günal, 2005). As a tourist destination, the
city is known for its cultural, religious, cave and
camping tourism features (Aydın, 2008). It can be
said that as a result of the rich culinary culture of the
city, it has come to the forefront as a gastronomic
tourism potential with some local foods (Bucak &
Aracı, 2013). Particularly, the city is distinguished
from other cultural destinations due to its authentic
touristic products (Kaygalak, Usta & Günlü, 2013).
According to data released by the Ministry of
Culture and Tourism, the city was visited by 231.335
domestic and international tourists in 2017 (Mardin
İl Kültür ve Turizm Müdürlüğü [Mardin Provincial
Directorate of Culture and Tourism], 2019). The
reason why Mardin was selected as a research area
is that tourists visiting the city can walk around the
ancient city, which is partially closed to traffic, which
is one of the best ways of enriching the experience.
In other words, walking is seen as an integral part
of both the transportation and the yielded tourist
experience in everyday life for tourists and local
people in the city.

INSTRUMENT DESIGN
The scale used in this study consists of a walkability
questionnaire derived from different dimensions by
examining the scales used in previous studies. The
survey used in the current research was based on a
5 point Likert scale consisting of 31 items ranging
from “very unimportant” to “very important” and
32 items (“Bad”, “Moderate” and “Good”) pertaining
to second part that has been developed after
extensive review of relevant literature. Overall, the
questionnaire generally consists of 3 sections. The
first part generates the demographic characteristics
of the respondents and the second part comprises of
travel habits while the third part related to decision
items affecting walking in a tourist area. In the
second part of the questionnaire the items were
developed by adapting the previous studies (e.g.,
Samarasekara, Fukahori and Kubota, 2011; Ariffin
and Zahari, 2013; Hall and Ram, 2018; Minhas and
Poddar, 2017; Karupiah and Bada, 2018; YazicioğluHalu, 2010; Audi, Byorkman, Couture and Najem,

Ng, Lai, Liao, Lao, Lau, Govada and Spruijt, 2016;
Tekel and Özalp, 2016; and Alfonzo, 2005).

POPULATION AND SAMPLING
The population of the study consists of tourists
visiting the ancient city and tourist attractions in the
center of Mardin. The number of domestic tourists
visiting the city in the first six months of 2019 is
248.421. The most visited periods of the city are
known as Autumn (September-October-November)
and Spring (March-April-May). (Mardin İl Kültür ve
Turizm Müdürlüğü [Mardin Provincial Directorate
of Culture and Tourism], 2019). To achieve the
aims and objectives of the current research, the
data were collected by one of the authors who had
the experience of collecting data by convenience
sampling method in the most visited April and May.
After the purpose of the study was explained to the
participants, they were included in the research
process based on their voluntary participation.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

CONCLUSION

REFERENCES

The present study was an attempt to examine to
what extent the city of Mardin is walkable for
visitors along with investigating factors affecting
the walkability of tourists who visited the old city
of Mardin. The results derived from the present
research show that the walkability has a wide variety
of factors those are consistent with prior studies
(Hall & Ram, 2018; Samarasekara et al., 2011)
creating expectation which has a significant effect
on the satisfaction levels of the tourists visiting the
city, and also this level of satisfaction determines
the quality of the experience received by the tourists
(Mansouri & Ujang, 2016).

The present paper has some useful managerial
and practical implications. The findings of the
current research have also revealed that the majority
of travelers preferred to use the internet as a source
of information before their visit to the city after
which TV comes then the second most important
source of information. This result supports the
idea that the marketing and promotional campaign
of the destination is immensely made and can
be improved the internet and TV respectively. In
other words, electronic word of mouth through
(eWOM) the internet and TV can be considered as
the most powerful supporting tools in developing
and strengthening the image of the destination. As
such, along with the use of the internet, marketing
managers of destinations should be aware of
the importance of the impacts of movies and
documentaries as an effective marketing tool that
spread through TV.
It has been also illustrated that walkability
is constituted by different dimensions will most
likely to have substantial impacts on the evaluation
of walkability as well as on the determination of
walking decision. Moreover, it can be claimed that
the quality of walkability is determined by the
cultural and historical landscape in urban areas
where travelers are mostly engaged in experiencing
mass tourism which is also complies with the
previous research studies (Gorrini & Bertini, 2018).

ABSTRACT

M

ICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) industry is rapidly growing segments
within the tourism industry, generating millions in revenues for cities and countries across
the globe. The aim of the study is to understand the probable expectations of the congress
market in the light of the MICE organizers’experiences. Because of the economic, social and cultural
importance of event and congress tourism and also the lack of studies on this topic in existing literature
have caused the need to carry out this research. Due to its rich cultural and historical heritage and
being the center of national and international political traffic, Ankara has a significant potential for
MICE tourism. Considering this potential, the population of the study consists of the hotels and travel
agencies as hosting and organizing establishments, in Ankara. So, purposeful sampling method was
used in the selection of the sample and qualitative data collected through 8 semi-structured interviews.
Fifteen questions were asked (such as kind of meetings, expectations and priorities of the guests,
problematic issues and dissatisfaction cases, expectations of the MICE guests etc.) about the congress
tourism. These questions are typically asked of each interviewee in the same way and in a systematic
order, but the questions are semi-structured in that the interviewers are allowed freedom to diverge
slightly from the script. The research model is “descriptive case study” and this type of case study is used
to describe an intervention or phenomenon and the real-life context in which it occurred. Data was
analyzed by using descriptive analysis and along with the conventional content analysis, word frequency
analysis was performed using NVivo 12 to draw a word cloud of the most mentioned words in the
interviews. According to the results, social programs and recreational activities were underlined as the
most important factors encouraging guests to stay longer in the congress destination. The meeting hall,
food and beverage and the hotel were the most mentioned words in both the requested features and the
problems experienced.

INTRODUCTION
Business tourism includes various meetings, seminars, conferences, conventions, symposiums, exhibitions,
prize trips, events that contribute to connecting people and sharing of knowledge and information (Šušić
and Mojić, 2014). MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) industry is one of the fastest
growing segments within the tourism industry generating millions in revenues for cities and countries across
the globe (Banu, 2016). MICE industry has become an emerging area of international business, which has
potential for generating economic benefits to the host destinations (Jago, 2013). Meetings are considered as
the basis of city tourism. The main feature of congress tourism is that it hosts participants having more power
than the average tourists who visit the same place and come with different motivation (Šušić and Mojić, 2014).
Continuous growth of event tourism makes it necessary for host destinations to design, plan and manage the
local, domestic, and international organizations by a professional manner. It is estimated that around 30% of
the total tourism income in the world comes from meeting tourism. Thus, event management has become a
business area where tourist expectations have an important effect on the planning process (Getz, 2008).
The participants interact with the local community around the congress center and accommodation
facility in the region where they are traveling for congress purposes. The people of the destination region
can adopt them by paying attention to the clothing styles, behaviors or various habits of the delegates. In the
same way, congressists can change behavior by influencing the behavior of local people (Aksu, 2013: 21).

280

Congress tourism is one of the fastest developing
and most profitable industries in the tourism sector
(Šilеrova et al. 2013). The increasing number of
national and international companies and the
need for meetings in the globalizing world and the
need to obtain information arising from scientific,
technological and professional developments have
improved the congress tourism (Gülbahar, 2006).
The exhibitions, conventions and meetings
industry, in terms of event tourism, has become an
emerging area of international business, which has
potential for generating economic benefits to the
host destinations (Jago, 2013). The participants of the
congress have various benefits both for the congress
organizers and the host destinations (Swarbrooke
and Horner, 2001). The first of these benefits is that
participants provide economic benefits for the host
region/country through accommodation, food and
beverage, local transport and various expenditures
(Oppermann and Chon, 1997). Secondly, congress
participants usually stay longer and spend more
time in destinations than other types of tourists.
Compared to tourists who visited Turkey in order
to coastal tourism, congress tourists spend much
more money. The expenditure per capita is 2.0002.500 dollars in congress tourism while it is 600700 dollars in coastal tourism. In other words,
the per capita expenditure of the congress tourist
is about three times more than the coastal tourist
expenditure. Therefore, many countries aim to take
more shares from gainings of this tourism type.
Turkey is advancing rapidly especially with İstanbul
in congress tourism list (TÜRSAB, 2013).
Tourism is a social event, as with the twoway interaction, the same is valid for congress
tourism. Meeting tourism contributes positively to
social developments, increasing the culture of the
people of the region and changing the world views
(Aymankuy, 2006: 20-21). Demand intensity of a
six-month period of the tourism season in Turkey,
raises problems of inefficient capacity utilization
and seasonal unemployment. Evaluation of congress
and fair tourism and utilization of the idle capacities
during the winter months are important in terms of
contribution of the sector to the solution of these
problems (TÜSİAD, 2014: 11).
Today, congress tourism is the growing segment
of the market. Because of the globalization,
new markets emerged in the interests of large
international companies, the development of
technology and science, people meet other people
with the same or similar interests, listen and talk
to well-known experts in the field, exchange ideas
or offer a new product because people need to
travel (Dragićević, 2008). Furthermore, increasing

the number of participants is not only the goal of
congress organizers, but also the main destination
of congresses. However, in order to achieve this
common goal, it is necessary to understand
the behavior of the congress participants. The
best way to do this is to understand how and
why individuals make the decision of congress
selection and participation (Zhang, Leung and
Qu, 2007). So the aim of the study is to analyze the
expectations of the congress market in the light of
the MICE organizers’experiences and to develop
recommendations to the literature and tourism
industry. Because of the importance of MICE
tourism on economic, social, cultural and also the
lack of studies about the congress tourism literature
have caused the need to carry out this research. It is
hoped that the results of the study will contribute to
MICE tourism literature.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Congress and MICE Tourism
The “congress” is a Latin word and it includes
the meaning of gathering and meeting. However,
conferences, symposia, seminars and conventions
are being used in the same sense of concepts in
Turkey. Congress can be defined as inviting national
and international people from the same or different
professional groups to exchange ideas or to obtain
information (Aymankuy, 2006: 4). A congress is
a meeting that is limited to one or more days and
requires expertise within the framework of a preagreed program, with the participation of people
coming from outside the gathered place, in particular,
aimed at a specific exchange in scientific fields
or occupational subjects (Çizel, 1999). Congress
tourism is the whole of travel, accommodation
events and relationships resulting from the gathering
of individuals to exchange information on a specific
subject in scientific fields or professions that require
expertise other than the places where they stay or
work (Karasu, 1985:10). As in other types of tourism,
congress tourism is the subject of people going out
of their place. The purpose of such organizations,
which also require travel and accommodation,
is to exchange information and experience from
members of the same field of expertise. In other
01
words, although the ultimate goal of the congresses
is to share information with people in the same fields
of activity, the use of tourist products is the result of
these activities. Consequently, congresses constitute
an important potential for tourism (Özdemir, S. S.
2014: 474).

4th International Tourism Congress

The planning of the congress includes accommodation facilities, meeting rooms, food and beverage
establishments, meeting place, transportation services, stationery procedures and the attendance of the
participants. All the work done from the time the participant leaves the house until he returns home is part
of the congress planning (Çakıcı, 2013 :57).

Ngamsom and Beck (2000) investigated the motivation of the participants in the international
conferences and according to the results of the study, the opportunity to travel to overseas destinations,
outdoor recreation, business or political activities, space exchange, connection and training opportunities
were identified as the most important motives in the international conferences. Rittichainuwat, Beck
and Lalopa (2001) identified the factors of congress motivation as visiting interesting places, personal
development and business/institution activities. Severt et. al. (2007) also highlighted some factors that
motivated participation in the congress, such as activities and opportunities, linkage, suitability of the
conference, educational benefits and products. The promising future of congress tourism may create a
desire to raise education levels in society (Jubayeva, 2013: 30).
The availability of fast, convenient and easy transportation to a country or congress, city plays
an important role in attracting congresses to that region. It is stated that when people decide to travel,
they choose the means of transportation by taking into consideration five basic variables: cost, distance,
experience, income and time (Şahin, Sönmez and Kahveci, 2014: 1205).
Visitors and exhibitors consider visiting new places, with lower cost and easy to reach destinations
(Arslan and Ersun, 2009: 140), having sufficient number and capacity of accommodation facilities,
recreation opportunities (Aymankuy, 1997: 32), cultural needs, acquiring new knowledge and experiencing
experiences (Özkan, 2005: 32), money, time, competence, health (Um and Crompton, 1990: 438),
technological infrastructure facilities and communication infrastructure facilities are flawless, no crime
incidents, geography is closed to natural disasters, health services are completed leadership, connection,
education and professional information factors (Price, 1993: 15) .
Yüncü and Kozak (2010: 118) emphasized that destination-related factors are important for congress
tourism. Especially the image of destination, destination climate and previous experiences for destinations
can be decisive in terms of congress tourism. Timor (2011: 126-127) pointed out the socio-economic
structure as the most important factor in the development of the international congress market in his study.
He stated that tourism develops especially with developing travel opportunities, increase in income and in
leisure time and this affects international congress tourism.
It is important that the city of congress has not only luxury and 4-5-star hotels, but also mid-range hotels
that allow participants from various income and social groups to attend congresses. Today, delegates tend
not only to attend the congress, but also to extend the length of stay in the congress area by participating
in some trips. Therefore, their expectations are higher. That’s why, the congress area should have a good
infrastructure in terms of accommodation facilities among other facilities (Özen, 1996:20).

The International Congress and Convention
(ICCA) maintains and publishes all congress
tourism developments and statistical information
in the world. Looking at the 2016 ICCA Statistics
Report, the USA ranks first with 934 meetings.
Germany ranks second with 689 meetings and the
United Kingdom ranks third with 582 meetings
(www.iccaworld.com). In addition to its positive
impact, congress tourism can have a negative social
and environmental impact in the region. Congress
participants often act massively in a short time,
which can lead to traffic jams, congestion in parking
spaces, restaurants, shops and other places. This is
especially valid for destinations with lower spatial
coverage where the number of participants does not
exceed the destination’s carrying capacity.
Istanbul, Antalya, Ankara and Izmir have come
to the forefront as suitable towns for congress in
Turkey. More specifically, 80 % of international
congresses are held in Istanbul. The quality of the
services provided by five-star hotels and congress
centers in these cities is very high (BAKA, 2012).
Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, creates its
own congress tourism because of the institutional
intensity caused by the parliament, embassies,
consulates, military commanders, political parties
centers, foundations, chambers, educational and
health care institutions (Tayfun and Enes, 2013).

METHODOLOGY
Due to its rich cultural and historical heritage
and being the center of national and international
political traffic, Ankara has a significant potential
for MICE tourism. Considering this potential,
the population of the study consists of the hotels
and travel agencies as hosting and organizing
establishments, in Ankara. So, purposeful sampling
method was used in the selection of the sample and
voluntary businesses were included. Respondents
were purposively selected according to their
organizational roles. Eight respondents were
accepted to join the interview from the different
establishments in tourism industry. It is stated
that (Eisenhard, 1989: 537; Yin, 2003) the number
of samples is sufficient to collect data from 4-12
participants for a case study in qualitative researches
(Konaklıoğlu, 2011: 95).
Semi-structured interview, which is one of
the qualitative research methods, was used for
collecting data. In research interview, participants
provide information about their behavior, thoughts
or feelings in response to questions posed by an
interviewer (Crano and Brewer, 2002).

Research questions were formed by
researchers based on literature review and related
researches. Fifteen questions were asked about the
congress tourism such as type of meetings held,
expectations and priorities of the guests, benefits
of the meetings to the host region, problematic
issues and dissatisfaction cases, expectations of the
MICE guests etc. in addition to some individual
questions (gender, age, position, education level
and field). The questions are typically asked of each
interviewee in the same way and in a systematic
order, but the questions are semi-structured in
that the interviewers are allowed freedom to
diverge slightly from the script (McIntosh and
Morse, 2015).
The questions were also pilot tested on three
clerks working in hotels and travel agents. Interviews
were conducted between April and June, 2019. All
the interviews were conducted in Turkish and on
average, each interview lasted about 20 min.
The research model is “descriptive case study”
and this type of case study is used to describe
an intervention or phenomenon and the reallife context in which it occurred (Yin, 2003).
Content analysis was used to analyze the data.
Content analysis is a research technique for
making replicable and valid inferences from data
to their context (Krippendorff, 1980). It’s a kinf of
observation method. Instead of observing people’s
behavior directly, or asking them to respond to
scales, the investigator takes the communications
that people have produced and asks questions
of the communications” (Kerlinger, 1964: 544).
Content analysis assumes that semi-structured
and open-ended interviews have been carried
out and that those conversations have been fully
recorded by interviewers (Burnard, 1991: 461).
In content analysis; there are four stages: (1)
coding, (2) identifying themes, (3) editing codes,
(4) presenting and interpreting findings (Demir,
2014). Data was analyzed by using descriptive
analysis and along with the conventional content
analysis, word frequency analysis was performed
using NVivo 12 to draw a word cloud of the most
mentioned words in the interviews.

Findings and Discussion
Table 1 exhibits the01individual profile of the
informants according to the variables such as gender,
education, age, position and organization. According
to the Table1, the majority of the respondents were

Most of the informants were highly educated and had tourism education, except for two respondents
who had finance (Inf.1) and design education (Inf.7). Half of the respondents were from hotels while the
remainder from travel agencies (2 informants) and fair organizations (2 informants). And most of them
were senior manager.
Firstly, the participants were asked to introduce themselves and their organizations. Then, informants
were asked as to what kind of meetings do you organize? According to the answers, mostly medicine (%31,3),
education (%18,8) and engineering (%12,5) congress and meetings were organized by their organization.
About the main benefits of MICE tourism for businesses and the host region, informants emphasized
mostly economic (employment, revenue and expenditure), socio-cultural and promotional effects of the
MICE tourism for the host region. For instance:
“Congresses provide the development of congress tourism in the destination. It provides economic
BOETPDJPDVMUVSBMCFOFĕUTUPCPUIUIFFOUFSQSJTFBOEUIFSFHJPO” (Inf.4). “Congresses make a great
contribution to the host region. Cultural interaction is experienced, tradesmen gain and from food and
beverage to souvenir sales are spent.” (Inf.1).
In line with previous research (Dwyer and Forsyth, 1997; Jago, 2013; Kaya, 2016; Lee and Back, 2005;
Oppermann and Chon, 1997; Swarbrooke and Horner, 2001; Yoo and Weber, 2005; Weber and Ladkin,
2004), MICE tourism has various effects for generating economic and socio-cultural benefits to the host
destinations. Previous studies on the events’ impact analysis suggest that they affect the local economy,
society and the sustainable development favorably (Panfiluk, 2015). The economic effects of the events
include an increase in employment (Crompton, Lee & Schuster, 2001), and in local taxes (Thrane, 2002).
In the social area the events contribute to raising awareness and social activity (Kim & Petrick, 2005) and
properly organized, they have a direct impact on creating a positive image of the region (Framke, 2002;
Getz, 1997).
Informants were asked as to what can be done to extend the stay of the guests in the congress destination?
According to the findings, social programs, activities and enrichment of recreational activities are mainly
mentioned. For instance:
“ćF WBSJFUZ PG SFDSFBUJPOBM BDUJWJUJFT JO UIF DJUZ DBO FYUFOE UIF EVSBUJPO PG UIF WJTJU 4P  UPVSJTUT
arrange their meeting schedule accordingly. For instance, Wonderland, is a good example in Ankara”
(Inf.2). “Leisure time activities and social programs are important complementary products for the
congress market” (Inf.8).

284

Similar to our findings, Ngamsom and Beck
(2000) indicated that opportunities for travel to
overseas destinations, outdoor recreation, business
or political activities, change of pace, networking,
and education were important factors which
motivated the respondents in attending international
conferences. Severt et. al. (2006) also identified the
factors that motivated participation in the congress
as activities and opportunities, linkage, suitability of
the conference, educational benefits and products.

4th International Tourism Congress

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
The selection of destinations within the scope
of congress tourism is evaluated by considering
various factors and these factors are mostly related
to the location of the destination, the characteristics
of the congress and meeting centers and the
opportunities it offers (Özdemir, 2014). Around
30% of the total tourism revenue in the world comes
from meeting tourism and is estimated at 250
billion dollars annually. Delegates bring mobility
to the commercial life of the region they visit and
increase their tax revenues (Kaya, 2016: 24). A
better understanding of the motivations, dynamics,
problems and facilitators will help meeting planners
in designing conference programs to better meet the
needs and wants of their customers (Rittichainuwat,
Beck and Lalopa, 2001).
According to the findings, social programs
and recreational activities were mainly mentioned
to extend the stay of the guests in the congress
destination by respondents. Traveling to desirable
destinations is an important attendance motivation
for convention visitors (Rittichainuwat and Mair,
2012). Lim and Zhu (2018) indicated that investment
in the MICE sector includes providing tourism/
recreation infrastructure and more attractions in
the host destination which can benefit visitors and
locals alike (Dwyer and Forsyth, 1997).
According to the results; the meeting hall, food
and beverage and the hotel were the most mentioned
words in both the requested features and the problems
experienced. Lower meeting space capacities place
hotels at a competitive disadvantage, supporting
the tenets of RBV (Resource-Based View) theory.
When structuring hotel management agreements,
management companies should be cognizant of
the negative performance effects of limited meeting
space capacities (Madanoglu and Ozdemir, 2016:
79). On the other hand, Crouch et. al. (2019) stated
that the quality and range of accommodation,
particularly in relation to its proximity to, or
association with, the convention facility itself, also
represented important considerations.
The tourism industry is a holistic sector which
consists of travel agencies and tour operators,
transport services, accommodation establishments,
recreational facilities and food and beverage
businesses in supply dimension (Yazıcıoğlu
and Kızanlıklı, 2018). So the congruence and
complementary features of these components are
very important for MICE tourism.

286

Historical and cultural attractions are
fundamental and powerful charm element for the
potential tourist flow. Although it does not affect
the congress demand for a destination by itself and
at the first degree, it is the reason of choice among
destinations which become similar in an increasingly
homogenous world. Therefore, if a destination can
provide tourists with a culturally and historically
diverse service beyond their daily routine, it clearly
has a competitive advantage (Özdemir, 2007: 21).
In addition to these elements, special infrastructure
and superstructure facilities such as convention
centers, conference centers and congress offices,
simultaneous interpretation facilities must also be
available. One or more deficiencies may prevent the
system from being implemented properly (Arslan,
2009: 42).
Many personal, social and cultural factors will
affect event tourism behavior, and although there is
a substantial body of literature on leisure and travel
in general, the various factors specifically affecting
event tourism have not been well explored (Getz,
2008). So, future research may extend the current
study by exploring the influence of personality
traits and demographic variables of the visitors.
Cross-cultural and motivational studies may also
contribute to the literature.

ABSTRACT

V

irtual reality is a three dimensional simulation model providing mutual communication in a
dynamic setting created by computers and which makes participants feel real-like. Development
of technology reveals applicable examples of new ideas. Diversified virtual reality applications,
each passing day, are important for tourism as they are for engineering, medicine, education and
marketing. The aim of this study is to present the profile of articles about tourism and virtual reality
in Turkey. Besides, suggestions for using of virtual reality technology are developed by analyzing the
usage of this technology. For that purpose, the concept of “virtal reality” is scanned in the data base
of ULAKBIM, with “topic” and “key words” sections. A bibliometric analyze was carried out over 73
articles which were published in ULAKBIM during 1996-2009.
Keywords: Bibliometric, Virtual Reality, Tourism

INTRODUCTION
Today, with the rapid development of technology, internet usage has started to increase. The Internet
accelerates the flow of information around the world and provides advantages in time and space(Aktamış
ve Arıcı, 2013,p.58).However, the trend towards virtual reality programs has also increased. As people make
their lives easier, their interest in the virtual environment has started to increase in tourism sector. This
situation has brought the concepts such as virtual tour and virtual reality together with new and modern
technology. It is possible to benefit from these programs for places that cannot be visited or seen. Virtual
reality is a simulation using computer graphics to create a world that seems to be real. Virtual reality is not
a stagnant world which has been synthesized. Virtual reality is a dynamic world that reacts to user’s input.
Virtual reality programs are a system in which a user can effectively control this simulation environment
through various devices in a computer-generated three-dimensional simulation of a real-world situation.
This technology can be used in many fields and for various purposes.It is inevitable that the tourism sector
will take its share from this technology.Nowadays, with the rapid spread of the concept of virtual tour, in
order to increase the passion of curiosity, the introduction of destination areas
01based on panoramic images
to tourists has become an environment where not only attract products and services but also attract more
customers(Arat ve Baltacıoğlu, 2015, p.105).

Virtual reality has found a wide range of
applications from entertainment to engineering,
from medical experiments to scientific experiments.
Tourism is an important sector where information
and communication technologies are used
extensively. This technology, which has an important
place especially in sharing and spreading tourism
destinations, is rapidly developing today. The use of
virtual reality is expected to increase gradually in the
promotion activities of the country. It is seen that
especially tourism destinations use virtual reality
applications to introduce themselves. It is predicted
that travel agencies will make a difference and be
successful with virtual tours.
In this study, conducted in Turkey and published
on ULAKBIM scientific papers related to tourism
and virtual reality by examining the method of
bibliometric analysis is intended to reveal the profile
of tourism-related articles and virtual realityIn
addition, the use of virtual reality technology in
tourism has been examined and recommendations
have been developed for the use of this technology
in tourism. In addition, suggestions for the use of
virtual reality in the field of tourism were developed
and the research results were aimed to guide future
scientific studies.

VIRTUAL REALITY
As the computer and internet technologies developed,
the internet-human interaction developed and
enabled expressions closer to human perception. One
of these expressions is virtual reality. Virtual reality is
a system in a computer-generated three-dimensional
simulation of a real-world situation where the user
can emotionally perceive this simulation environment
with the special devices she wears on, and can
effectively control this artificial world through these
devices(Kayabaşı, 2005).In virtual reality, everything
is a simulation of virtual, digital or reality. Virtual
reality opens up the gates of the three-dimensional
world, and beyond that, it offers us a realistic
experience. According to another definition, virtual
reality is a three-dimensional, interactive, computergenerated environment that sees information and
human as integrated. They are three-dimensional,
interactive, computer-generated environments. These
environments are models of real or imaginary worlds
(Warwick, Gray, & Roberts, 1993, p. 3).According to
Tepe et al, Virtual reality is a system that allows people
to mislead their senses and feel them in realistic
environments (Tepe, Kaleci, & Tüzün, 2016).It is
based on the principle that the virtual reality viewer
or the user is etiology within an edited time structure
and interacts with it in an advanced image space;
It has been defined as an environment consisting
290

of technological tools such as three-dimensional
image and audio devices, reproducing devices by
simulating sensory effects such as power, motion and
touch, consisting of various data input and output
Technologies (Kuruüzümcü, 2007).According to
another definition, virtual reality is structured on the
approach of combining an environment created with
(virtual) human senses in a computer environment
with graphics, colors, animations and sound effects,
and making one feel like a part of the environment
(Arat & Baltacıoğlu, 2016, p. 17)In the light of the
above definitions, virtual reality can be summarized
as a three-dimensional simulation environment
in which users interact with other objects in order
to have real-life experiences in an artificial world
made by the computer with the imaging equipment
that they wear on their bodies or enter into different
devices (Deryakulu, 1999, p. 78).
Karasar (2014) describes the effects of virtual
reality on participants from Dagit:

in activities within the environment and
multiple users can interact simultaneously in
the same environment.
Virtual reality, headphones, screen, smart
glasses, computers, smart gloves, etc. with the help
of smart devices, such as events in the realm of the
realization of the virtual environment is a technology
that provides a sense of reality. Virtual reality makes
people forget about the real world by immersing
them in virtual environments and drawing them
into virtual environments and enables them to be
active and act as if they were real in the artificial
world (Demirezen, 2019, p. 6).
Interaction devices used in virtual reality may
vary according to their purpose. These; head mounted
presentation systems (HMD), data glove, data
clothing (body suits) and space ball can be counted as
(Tepe, Goalkeeper, & Tüzün, 2016, p. 550-551).
Although virtual reality applications seem to be
a costly technology, the experience of virtual reality
has become desirable and sought after by everyone.
Increasing interest in virtual reality attracted the
attention of mobile technology companies in the
first place and paved the way for the development
of many new mobile hardware and applications
including virtual reality components. Virtual reality
applications have become accessible and usable

especially for mobile operating systems by reducing
the costs of virtual reality glasses. Many free virtual
reality applications that can be downloaded from
PlayStore or the App Store have become easily
accessible to every user with smart devices thanks
to the cost-effective Cardboard glasses developed by
Google (Tepe, kaleci, & Tüzün, 2016 p.550-551).
It is seen that the virtual reality used in many
sectors is now being used in the tourism sector. There
are many examples of the rapid implementation of
this technology, which is used especially in virtual
tours and virtual museums (Arat and Baltacıoglu,
2016).

VIRTUAL REALITY IN TOURISM
Virtual Reality technologies, which are expected to
reach a market of US $ 40 billion in 2020, have found
their place in the tourism industry as in many other
fields (Kanak, Erdoğan ve Yılmaz, 2018).Tourism
sector is one of the sectors that can benefit greatly
from the advantages of virtual reality technology.
With this superior technology, it is possible to see
the places we want to go to, to travel to Mars, to
walk on the Moon, to travel at the speed of light
(Kurbanoğlu, 1996, p. 27).
Two of the important virtual reality applications
in tourism are virtual tours and virtual museums.
It can be said that virtual tours started by being
influenced by virtual museology. Virtual Tour is
a visual application that gives the impression of
three-dimensional image and transfers the latest
technology software and visual media applications
on the photographs, creating a feeling of navigation
for the visitor in the internet environment. Virtual
Tour is the process of creating panoramic images
with special shooting materials and photographing
techniques, and processing these photos and then
combining them to obtain a global image (Koçer &
Uzunsakal, 2015, p. 1).
The development of virtual reality technology
is effective in creating potential tourists in the
tourism sector. The increase in the use of virtual
reality as a means of publicity has given rise to great
opportunities in increasing tourism earnings of
enterprises and states, giving people pre-experience
and influencing decision-making processes
(Durmaz, Bulut, & Tankuş, 2018, p. 39).
Virtual tours can be divided into twodimensional and three-dimensional. Twodimensional virtual tours, contextual, educational
and brochure virtual tours can be examined in three
sections. Three-dimensional virtual tours are virtual
tours in which three-dimensional (3D) models,

which are designed in the same way as the reality,
are created with real-time rendering software called
game engine software. The most important feature
of such virtual tour applications is that it is user
intervention. It is useful in terms of being visual
and creating a sense of reality and is aimed at giving
people more time (Derman, 2012, p. 46).
3D virtual reality technology with the ancient
city in Turkey on a tourist trip in Bergama
Zeus, Athena and Asclepius temple offers 3D
sightseeing opportunities. The province of Mersin
is introduced using the virtual tour method in the
Mersin virtual environment with the Tekno Mersin
Project developed in cooperation with the Mersin
Metropolitan Municipality and the Tourism Area of
Mersin and Surrounding Area (METAB) (Ekici &
Güven, 2017, p. 406-408).
Making all kinds of marketing and reservations
in the virtual environment in tourism is one of the
most important advantages of tourism in today’s
world where internet is widely used. People leaving
their homes, visiting the hotels they want to go with
the virtual reality application, and choosing their
rooms by seeing three-dimensional in advance,
will create a more positive image for the hotel in
the eyes of people than other hotels. Virtual reality
application for hotel staff can also be motivating.
In addition to working personnel, having a device
that shows the guests in all areas of the hotel in 3D
will facilitate the work of the personnel (Arat &
Baltacıoğlu, 2016, p. 110).
Advances in technology, in many forms,
often have a direct and lasting impact on tourism.
Recently, developments in information and
communication technologies have changed tourism
in many ways with its effects in various fields from
consumer demands to management. For example,
many tourists have adopted the Internet as a means
of acquiring travel information. An important area
of ICT is virtual reality, which is widely used in a
variety of fields, including entertainment, design
and simulation training. In fact, virtual reality has
various uses in the tourism industry. For example, a
London-based travel agency marketing an Amazon
eco-tourism river cruise may want to promote
the trip using a fully immersive a head-mounted
presentation system that allows potential customers
to enjoy a virtual simulation of the tour (Demirezen,
2019, p. 7-8).
01
With the introduction of virtual reality and the
significant increase in its advantages, businesses
have turned to using technology in this field. It is
able to provide a pre-experience that is not possible
to be lived in the tourism sector before and enables
the companies using this technology to differentiate

291

4th International Tourism Congress

from other enterprises and create a brand image.
Providing the preliminary experience enables
potential customers to be created, people to turn
to technology-based businesses and consequently
increase demand. As one of the returns of the
increasing demand, the customer potential that
will increase with the formation of feedback will
positively affect the enterprises in the booking
and marketing point with the introduction of
this technology. Companies that keep pace with
technology and are constantly in follow-up will
prevent non-technology enterprises and lead the
tourism industry by creating sector competition
(Durmaz, Bulut, & Tankuş, 2018, p. 38).
Due to the nature of virtual reality applications,
it is valuable to promote tourism. Because tourism
is based on discovering new places and getting
new experiences. Hotels, casinos, theme parks,
special events or virtual sea cruises can be revived
to provide a better feeling and impression of what
the customer has purchased. Virtual reality systems
can exert tremendous persuasive power and provide
a lucrative opportunity to successfully market a
property that is currently in use in the tourism
sector (Demirezen, 2019, pp. 7-8).

METHOD
The aim of this study is to determine the profile of
the article on virtual reality in Turkey. In addition,
the use of virtual reality technology in tourism has
been examined and recommendations have been
developed for the use of this technology in tourism.
In the literature, there is no Turkish publication
attempting to reveal the bibliographic profile of the
concept of virtual reality. The results of this study
will be useful for the creation of future scientific
studies on virtual reality. For this purpose, the
following problems are sought.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Virtual reality technology is an effective concept
that allows to change the laws of time, scale and
physics. Thanks to this technology, which increases
the interaction between human and computer, it
has moved the designer from the two-dimensional
world of mouse, keyboard and monitor to threedimensional worlds where naturalness and intuition
are at the forefront of design (Zafer, 2007, p. 17).
The concept of virtual reality, which has
been used frequently in medicine, architecture,
engineering, education and many other fields, is
progressing towards being a concept that can be
used by businesses in the market in the competitive
sector in which human relations are experienced
intensively. As a result of the literature review, the
contributions of virtual reality technology to the
field of tourism were determined. In this context,
rapid adaptation of this technology to the tourism
sector is expected to be beneficial.
In this study, conducted in Turkey and scientific
articles on virtual reality, which was published
in ULAKBİM it was examined by bibliometric
analysis. In addition, the use of virtual reality
technology in tourism has been investigated. As a
result of the study, the profile of the articles related
to virtual reality was revealed. According to the
data examined within the scope of the research;
The distribution of articles related to virtual reality
in ULAKBİM according to the databases is mostly
determined in the life sciences and social sciences
databases. When the distribution according to

the research disciplines is examined, it is found
that 23 different disciplines are studied. When the
publication years of articles related to virtual reality
in ULAKBİM were examined, it was concluded
that virtual reality has been studied in research
disciplines since 1996. In recent years, it has been
determined that virtual reality is an important field
of study for research disciplines and the studies
are mainly carried out with qualitative research
methods.
Among articles related to virtual reality
published in ULAKBİM, one article was realized
in the discipline of Tourism. When the benefits of
virtual reality technology to tourism discipline are
taken into consideration, all destinations, every
business in tourism area, museums etc. should
adopt this technology. Accordingly, publications in
the field are considered to be insufficient. Therefore,
it may be suggested that tourism researchers in
universities work in this field. Moreover, it is thought
that the use of this technology in tourism education
will contribute to the training of experienced
individuals for the tourism sector.
The results of the research show that quantitative
research methods are less used in scientific researches.
It is clear that focusing on experimental studies in
scientific researches in the field of social sciences
will contribute to the benefits of using virtual reality
technology. This research covers only the articles
in ULAKBİM. In the following researches, other
databases can be examined to determine whether
these results are similar. In addition, international
publications can be examined and comparisons can
be made.

ABSTRACT

W

ith the industrial revolution, the increase in the use of fossil fuels, increasing population,
urbanization, wrong land use, unconscious release of waste, deforestation, human activities
disrupted the flow of the natural system and caused many environmental problems including global warming. Global warming and climate change, which is one of the most important problems in the world, affects every aspect of our lives and creates negative effects on many factors such
as natural ecosystems, the existence and health of living things, and water resources. These long-term
effects (such as melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, displacement of climatic zones, intensification and
effects of severe weather events and related natural disasters, drought, erosion, desertification and consequent shortage of clean water, epidemic diseases, increase of agricultural pests) are expected to become more pronounced in the future. Tourism that uses natural and historical environment as a resource
is inevitable to be affected by this process. Turkey have rich opportunities in terms of tourism potential
with its natural beauties, historical charm, socio-cultural characteristics. In tourism where natural, cultural and historical values are the source, negativities especially on the environment directly affect the
tourism sector.
It is inevitable that tourism will be affected by global climate change, which is also dependent on climate
elements such as temperature, precipitation, wind and humidity and the changes experienced in them.
Antalya, the most important tourism city of Turkey, is one of the cities that will be most affected by
global warming. This will naturally, culturally, socially and economically cause national and regional
damages. Individuals as well as managers play important roles in the fight against global warming and
climate change. It is aimed to determine view of the public of Antalya on global warming and climate
change by using an interview applied to 386 people in the center districts (Konyaalti, Kepez, Aksu, Dosemealti, Muratpasa). In the first sectionof the study, consists of three main sections, the concepts and
definitions, causes and effects of global warming and climate change are presented from the literature.
The second section of the survey consists of determining the sampling size, selecting the questioning
method, preparing the interview, pre-testing the interview and correcting the errors, applying the interview and evaluating the results statistically. With the interview, the causes of the most important
environmental problems, global warming and climate change were asked and the situation of Antalya
(affected or not) by global warming and climate change were evaluated. According to the results of the
interview, the respondents stated that Antalya was also affected by global warming and climate change
and this was understood by the precipitation and uneven season. Among the things that should be
done to prevent these problems, it is stated that the protection of natural areas, support of recycling and
afforestation activities should be increased. In the third and final section of the study, some suggestions
were given in terms of professional discipline of landscape architecture in the fight against global warming and climate change.

INTRODUCTION
More than 50% of the global population lives in
urban areas, in recent years. Worldwide, the urban
area is expected to increase approximately threefold
from 2000 to 2030 (SCBD 2013, Anguluri and Narayanan 2017). The fact that urban areas continue to
increase in the coming years and the rapid growth
of cities in terms of size and density will create significant pressure on the natural structure of the city
(Nor et al. 2017). This situation necessitates the examination of the urban environment.
Urbanization affects the natural resources negatively as it changes the land use, transportation, industrial and agricultural production, consumption
and social activities of individuals. Unplanned cities
concentrating around fertile agricultural areas, forests,
seashores and river resources lead to irreversible losses
in these areas. It is inevitable that landscape planning,
which is also important in terms of conservation and
proper use of our natural resources, will have a place in
the planning process of our country, especially in urban planning (Mansuroglu and Dag 2019).
With the industrial revolution, the increase in
the use of fossil fuels, increasing population, urbanization, unconscious release of waste, deforestation,
human activities disrupted the flow of the natural
system and caused many environmental problems
including global warming. Global warming and climate change, which is one of the most important
problems in the world, affects every aspect of our lives and creates negative effects on many factors such
as natural ecosystems, the existence and health of living things, and water resources. These long-term
effects are (such as melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, displacement of climatic zones, intense weather
events and related natural disasters and strengthening their effects, drought, erosion, desertification
and consequent shortage of clean water, epidemic
diseases, increase of agricultural pests) (IPCC 2007,
Solomon et al. 2007, IPCC 2013) expected to become even more pronounced in the coming years.
Climate change can be defined by taking into
account human activities that increase greenhouse
gas accumulations. The United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (1992) describes “A
change in climate as a result of human activities that
directly or indirectly disrupt the composition of the
global atmosphere, in addition to the natural climate change observed in a comparable time period”.
Global warming, which is used as a concept
similar to climate change, “Since the industrial revolution, especially due to the rapid increase in the
accumulation of greenhouse gases released into the
atmosphere by various human activities such as

300

burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural
activities and industrial processes, the natural greenhouse effect has been strengthened by the effect of
urbanization; (lower and middle troposphere) is defined as the increase in temperature (Turkes 2007).
Changes in climate events are expected to pose
significant risks to communities and ecosystems
(IPCC 2013). In addition to global disasters of global warming and climate change, unique climate risks may arise in urban areas (for example, the city’s
warm island, impermeable surfaces that increase
flooding, coastal development threatened by sea level rise, etc.) (Carter et al. 2015, Gartland 2008, Gill
et al. 2007, Smith et al. 2009, Wilbanks et al. 2007).
Therefore, it is foreseen that all countries, even cities, will be affected by climate change in different
dimensions and will face various adaptation problems. Therefore, Fünfgeld (2010) states that the international community is working to take measures
to mitigate the impact of climate change. Doherty
et al. (2016) state that despite the adaptation of people throughout their environment, climate change
poses new and unique challenges that threaten their
lives and livelihoods.
Climate change will undoubtedly affect human
life in various ways. Some sectors that are in close
relationship with the climate may also be affected
by these negativities. One of the most important of
these sectors is tourism. Considering that the external environment and natural factors have a direct
impact on tourism movements and tourist decisions, it is inevitable that climate changes will affect
tourism. Because Didascalou et al. (2007) state that
the competitiveness of a destination depends on the
ideal climatic conditions appropriate for the type of
tourism sustained. Therefore, climate disadvantaged
areas are less preferred by tourism planners and tourists (IPCC 2007).
Turkey has rich opportunities in terms of tourism potential with its natural beauties, historical
charm, socio-cultural characteristics. In tourism,
where natural, cultural and historical values are used
as a resource, negativities especially on the environment directly affect the tourism sector. Karadeniz
et al. (2018), tourism contributes to globalization
in three dimensions, social, spatial and economic
aspects, and is one of the sectors most affected by
global warming (Viner and Agnew 1999). Turkey
is surrounded by seas on three sides of the climate
can vary in size due to the rugged topography and
local orographic features. The different regions and
regions of our country, which is one of the countries
that will be most affected by climate change with its
diverse climate structure, will be affected by climate
change in different sizes and forms (Ozturk 2002).

In this study, the causes and consequences of
the most important environmental problems of the
world, global warming and climate change, and the
situation of Antalya affected by the global warming
and climate change and suggestions for preventing
this problem were questioned. As a result, some suggestions have been made in terms of the professional discipline of landscape architecture in the fight
against global warming and climate change.

Pre-Testing and Revision of
Interviews

MATERIAL AND METHOD

Data collecting: According to population percentage of inhabitants within Antalya city center,
number of individuals was selected randomly for
the interviews.
Building up scaling system: Indicating a scaling
system was indicative in the selection of question
types.
Analysis and interpretation of data: The interview form covers two main chapters; identify the
effects of climate change and global warming and
socioeconomic character. IBM SPSS 20.0 software
used to assess the relation between scores and levels
of identify the effects of climate change and global
warming and socio-economic characteristics (gender, marital status, age, education level). Following
the evaluation of frequencies and percentages cross
tabs and chi-square test were used to test statistical
significance that accepted as alpha level of 0.05.

This study was carried out in Antalya city. The study
area is an important tourism city of Turkey and located in Mediterranean costal region. The study was
carried out between March and June 2019 to determine opinions of resident on global warming and
climate change in Antalya.
The main objectives of this section were indicating size of the sample population, selecting interview method, design of the interview, pre-testing
and revision of interviews, data collecting and analysis and interpretation of data.

Indicating Size of the Sample
Population
According to the sampling size for the population
over 100 000 justified by Balci (2015) with 5% error
efficiency is 384. In sampling this number was represented with randomly selected 386 people in total
among of citizens in Antalya city center.

Interview forms were develop in cooperation with
experts working on environmental issues and interviews and evaluated under the major processes of
content, construction, interpretation and evaluation. Pre-testing was carried out by the first face to
face interviews with randomly selected 30 inhabitants living in Antalya city center.

For the determination of “the effects of climate
change and global warming” 6 main questions (five
three-point Likert type questions) were asked to
samples. On the “Socio-economic Characteristic”,
relation between the factors of gender, age, profession, education level that effecting socio-economic
characteristics was studied.

There is close relation between socio-economic characteristics and identify the effects of climate change and global warming. Gender, marital status, age,
income and education level on the environment
were investigated in this section (Table 1). Of the
respondents 47,4% were male and 52,6% female
while 21,5% of them were married, 74,6% single and
3,9% divorced. Table 1 indicates the information on
marital status, age, income and education level of
the respondents. Education is a key milestone in
the creation of environmentally responsible behavior. Great majority of the respondents in 52,3% are
between the ages of 18-24, and the majority of high
school (50%) according to their education level.

It is seen that all participants respond to the statement that the effects of climate changes will increase as a
result of scenarios that may arise as a result of global warming (Table 2). Women (98%) responded with a
higher rate of agreement than men (97.3%) and the responses were statistically significant (p <0.001). The
25-34 age group (99%), singles (98.6%), high school graduates (97.9%) and those with 2001-3000 TL income (98.9%) responded with the highest rate of agreement and the responses were statistically significant.

According to these scenarios, there is a statistically significant difference between the responses of the
men that 87.4% agree, 10.4% neutral and 2.2% disagree with the statement that quality drinking water will
decrease and be very expensive (p <0.001). The highest rate of unstable was 15.6% in the 35-44 age group
(χ² = 21.356, p <0.001) and the highest percentage of those who disagreed was 10.6% in the 45-54 age group
and the results were statistically significant (χ² = 17.789, p <0.001) is remarkable (Table 3).

As the result of the melting of the glaciers, coastal settlements will be submerged, while women agree
with a higher rate, while men respond with 21.3% undecided (χ²=150,426, p<0.001). 55-64 age group stated
that I agree with the highest rate (χ²=7,364, p=0,007). As it is seen in the table, it is possible to say that as the
age increases, concerns about the subject increase (Table 4). It is also remarkable that married individuals
(79.5%) responded with a higher rate of agreement than singles (76.7%).

University graduates responded that 95.1% agree that precipitation will become more variable. While
13% of college graduates stated that they were undecided, 90.7% of males and 89.7% of females agreed.
Some of the participants reported that rainfall has changed even in recent years and that the effect may be
felt more in the following years if no measures are taken. There are some who think that irregular rainfall
can lead to flood formation and consequently product loss (Table 5).

Among the participants who stated that the increase in temperatures could affect ocean and sea water
temperatures, 81.3% of the respondents and 76.0% of the respondents stated that the temperature level
could increase. It is among the most undecided graduate graduates (26.3%) about the increase in ocean
and sea water temperature values. However, the percentage of respondents who agree with this statement
(68.4%) was high and the responses were statistically significant (Table 6).

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Where it is determined that the people in tourism cities do not manage global warming and climate change, they have stated that Antalya’s global city’s nature
and climate change have been affected, while the seasons have been disorganized. In addition, the participants stated that the rainfall became irregular and the
temperature and drought increased in the city.
Changes in climate events in tourism cities, the
change of tourism periods of the city’s tourism potential will be able to produce many different results.
Therefore, it is important to take the necessary precautions by considering that the effects of climate
change and global warming are felt in the tourism
sector rather than being considered as a future
event. The effects of global warming and climate
change in the tourism sector can be listed as follows;
t %FDSFBTŔOH UIF UPVSŔTN QPUFOUŔBM XŔUI UIF

As a result, it is considered that on a global scale/
national measures should be taken in the struggle against climate change due to global warming,
which is a global environmental problem, and it is
necessary to carry out studies on diversification of
tourism and performing appropriate tourism activities in different regions of our country in order to be
least affected by tourism, which is one of the important sectors of our country.

The Idea of Divine Mercy and Its Religious Cult in Krakow as Impulse on Urban
Tourism
Paweł PLICHTA
Jagiellonian University
pabloplichta@gmail.com

ABSTRACT

D

espite the secularization and changes in the forms of religiosity of modern man [e.g. Woodhead
2001; Heelas 2002; Tacey 2004; Lynch 2007] religion plays a significant role in modern tourism
[Norman 2011; Dallen & Boyd 2006]. Over the last years, Krakow has become one of the most
visited cities in Central and Eastern Europe. The former capital of Poland with its multicultural history
is now a thriving academic and cultural center [Airey 1998; Hughes, Allen & Wasik 2003; Plichta 2014]
but also religious [Jackowski 2008; Kapera 2011]. The city’s promotional strategies emphasize, among
others, such aspects and spaces as: Kazimierz - Jewish quarter [Ashworth 2002]; Krakow as the city of
Saint John Paul II [Niedzwiedz 2009] and Saint Faustyna Kowalska [Niedzwiedz 2017; Soljan & Liro
2015] and a center of numerous Roman Catholic sanctuaries, synagogues and places related to Jewish
religiosity [Sandri 2013]; a city through which there are several cultural and religious routes including
the Camino de Santiago [Mroz 2014].
The aim of the paper is to present ways of functioning of Krakow as a tourist city through the prism of its
religious heritage and the idea of Divine Mercy and its cult in Krakow. Interesting is the tension between
its cultural heritage and contemporary ideas implemented both with the use of existing religious sites
and the creation of new ones. New media are particularly important in this respect.
The presented paper is a result of in-house and field studies conducted since 2010. A descriptive-analytic
method, a dynamic-comparative method, as well as statistical methods were used to present the study
results.

ABSTRACT

T

he importance of city tourism has been highlighted over the last decade. All national, regional, or
city-based organizations have an important role in the development of city tourism in destinations
and each of these stakeholders spends considerable amounts of money to promote the cities.
Tourism brochures are among the most used tools in tourism promotion (Wicks and Schuett, 1991).
In spite of the advances in information technologies, brochures are still one of the main references for
tourists and widely used before and during the vacation (Andereck, 2005).

Tourism brochures are the key elements to build and represent cities as tourism destinations (Pritchard
and Morgan, 2001). These brochures also exhibit various attractions of a city and arouse the desire of
tourists to visit that city. Besides while traveling the city, tourists widely use city brochures as a reliable
information source. The purpose of the study is to investigate the tourism brochures to evaluate the city
tourism potential of Turkey’s metropolitans. Turkey has 30 metropolitans and Provincial Directorate of
Culture and Tourism (PDCT) of each city usually leads the responsibility of the city’s promotion. Therefore,
a content analysis of the tourism brochures on the PDCTs web page constitutes the basis of the research.
After checking the official web pages of PDCTs, cities that do not have tourism brochures on the web
pages were excluded. In total, 20 cities were analyzed based on the criteria determined by Cibinskiene and
Snieskiene (2015), Güçer, Hassan and Pelit (2013), and Zhou and DeSantis (2005). These criteria include
information about geographic location, climate, history, activity list (what to do, what to eat, what to buy),
transportation to the city, urban transportation, city-map, natural, cultural and other attractions, travel
routes, culture and art, yellow pages, tourism enterprises, and tourism types.
As a conclusion, most of the cities give detailed information about their natural and cultural attractions in
their tourism brochures. By emphasizing their own attractions more, cities allocate more space for these
attractions in the brochures. For instance, while city tourism stands out for Istanbul, Antalya highlights
sea-sand-sun, Adana and Gaziantep underline gastronomy, Şanlıurfa impresses on faith, and Denizli
focuses on culture. On the other hand, cities mostly underestimate information about transportation,
activity list, and city map which are essential for the tourists in a vacation. Most importantly, cities
disregard foreign language option both on the web pages and the brochures.
At last, considering the criteria of city tourism, most of the metropolitans of Turkey have potential in
terms of city tourism. While some of the cities highlight this potential, the majority of the cities pay no
attention. More important is that one-third of the metropolitans do not have a tourism brochure even if
they have a city tourism potential. However, they still give tourism information on the PDCT web pages.
Cultural values in the city centers are the most emphasized attractiveness in the brochures.
The study finally notes the implications for local authorities. As tourism brochures are widely used and
influence tourists, all stakeholders should collaborate to promote the city and make efforts to reach out
to more tourist. Tourism brochures should definitely be accessible to tourists and provide information
that are essential for tourists such as inner and intercity transportation, foreign language option and
accessibility to tourist attractions.

The Need For A Tour Guide While The Cities Get Smarter
Grant Altay TAŞKIN
Res. Assist., Aksaray University
grantaltaytaskin@hotmail.com

ABSTRACT

N

owadays one can easily understand that day by day we are becoming a part of the age of
technology. Humans have accepted and allowed technology to do its own job. The way things
are changing sometimes scares people but on the other hand it makes life easier. In certain
countries artificial intelligence and robots started to appear in daily life and before anyone realises, they
will become a part of our daily routine.
Some day we will only need to click a button and everything will happen for us. But clicking a button
without seeing a face or hearing a voice is something totally different for us. The question is, do we like
to get things done as quickly as possible or do we still look for communication.
The new trend in the tourism sector is the “Smart Tourism and Smart Destinations” which starts with
giving you an idea of how and where to plan your holiday and travel. It also helps you with all other
aspects throughout your vacation. These might be smart device applications like audio guidance,
translation services, direction guidance, making reservations or augmented realities like pointing your
phone towards the scene of the theatre and watch a gladiator fight.
Tour guides, who we call the ambassadors of tourism, may experience problems with the rate of
technological development. Although, taking advantage of technology such as, navigator, smart phones,
kindles, head sets, cameras, altimeters and many more makes the job easier for guides. So if the evolution
of technology continues will there be any need for a tour guide?
The aim of this study is to determine if the job of the tour guide can survive the technological
improvements or even get better and still be preferred by the tourists who are travelling to new places
and new cultures. The methodology of the study is qualitative. A structured interview has been carried
out. The sample of the group only includes tour guides over the age of 50. This is because they are near
to retirement and don’t expect earning their living by guiding people anymore. So their opinions will
be more appropriate compared to young guides who are at the beginning of their tour guiding lives
and need this job for many years to come and would not like to lose the battle against technological
improvements. Also the study will add some suggestions based on the results obtained from the analysis.
Keywords: Tour Guidance, Tour Guide, Smart Tourism, Smart Destination, Technology, Smart City.

Tracing Industrial Heritage: The Case Of Berlin Bicycle Route

evinc.dogan@gmail.com

ABSTRACT

T

he aim of this paper to investigate how the industrial heritage is represented on a cultural bicycle
trail and used as a tool for constructing the tourist gaze. A qualitative case study methodology is
used, where the analysis is twofold. A phenomenological approach is adopted at the first step. The
bicycle route is explored to get first-hand experience and familiarize with the data in the physical urban
context. The second step is the document analysis. Texts are collected and analysed for interpreting
the meaning by digging deeper into socio-cultural context. The cycling route is a form of experience
bridging the spatio-temporal gap between tangible heritage (monuments, landmarks) and intangible
dimensions (symbols and meanings). The findings reveal shifts in meaning drawing on relations between
the physical space and represented space. The cultural routes are of interest as innovative tourism
products. They provide opportunities for creating a strong destination image. Therefore, this research
provides an initial examination of the ways in which cultural routes can shape tourism experience. This
exploratory research provides a framework to tackle with heritage and representation, while offering
further avenues for investigating urban tourism where tourists can be co-creators for adding layers of
meaning based on their personal experience. This helps increasing awareness about urban heritage and
offers an alternative tourist gaze and perception.
Keywords: Berlin, Industrial Heritage Routes, Tourist Gaze, City Image, Urban Experience.

ABSTRACT

D

etermining the contribution of branded cities to the tourism sector which provides an added
value to the national economy is important in terms of socio-economic development. In
this study, which is prepared with this perspective, Turkey and Russia cases are discussed
comparatively. The framework of the study is determined as Antalya and St. Petersburg, which are
defined as culture and art cities. It is aimed to obtain information about the current status of tourism in
the tourism market by examining the contribution of the mentioned cities to tourism. The information
about the cities is obtained by analyzing the data from Antalya Provincial Directorate of Culture and
Tourism, Turkish Republic of Culture and Ministry of Tourism, Russian Federation Ministry of Culture,
Tourism Data Bank June 2019 statistics. In the light of this information, the distinctive features of these
cities which are prominent in tourist attraction have been identified.
Most of the tourists from Russia, Germany and Ukraine came to Antalya for the sea/coast; most of the
tourists from Italy, France and Germany came to St. Petersburg for cultural tourism. As a result of this
study, the importance of city branding had been tried to be highlighted through the two major tourist
cities of Turkey and Russia.

ABSTRACT

T

he study investigates whether the destination preferences of foreign tourists from different
countries, which has chosen to come to Turkey, affect each other’s decision. Cointegraiton
analysis is employed for this purpose on time series of inbound tourist from various countries
to Turkey during the period betwixt 1996m10 - 2017m12. The findings shall be useful in promotion
and advertising policies. If the preference of inbound tourists from two different countries to come to
Turkey affect each other, the advertisement in these countries will have greater effect since the affect
each other. Hence advertising in such country parings will be more effective in the long run.

Not Every Small Hotel is a Boutique Hotel

ABSTRACT

M

any industries have been affected by consumer demands and expectations that have been
changed with postmodernism which become popular in the 1990s. Tourism, which is one
of the important dynamics of the service industry, has also been affected by this change and
businesses have adapted their products and services to the postmodern consumer. New investments
in the tourism industry have also been made according to this change. Postmodern tourists traveling
with the desire of self-actualization started to demand the unusual holiday preferences instead of the
classic ones. The concept of “boutique hotel” which was first used by Steve Rubell in 1984, became
popular with the effect of postmodernism in the 1990s. Today, the demand of boutique hotel which
is an important part of the city tourism is increased by tourists who want to get rid of the limitations
of daily life, seek flexibility, make changes in their lifestyle and desire freedom. The boutique hotels,
which know their guests very well and provide services according to their personal preferences, offer
memorable experiences to their guests with about 20 different concepts. When the related literature is
examined, it is pointed out that there are many different approaches to the definition of boutique hotels.
In Turkey, the obligations for obtaining a boutique hotel certificate are specified by the “Regulation
on Certification and Qualifications of Tourism Facilities” and the boutique hotel certificate is given
to hotels that have these qualifications. This situation causes concept confusion. The main purpose of
this conceptual study is to clarify the concept of boutique hotel, to determine the difference between
boutique hotel and small hotel, to draw attention to the problems of boutique hotel industry and to
develop suggestions for the solution of the problems. In accordance with this purpose, the concept
of boutique hotel, its history and development process, its value and importance for the hospitality
industry, requirements for boutique hotel certificate and the problems caused by the sector have been
examined within the scope of literature. Significant result obtained from the examination of the
related regulations and the decisions of the Tourism Council in 2017 is most of the hotels presented
as boutique have no certificate. This situation is caused by difficulties and even impossibilities of some
of the conditions in the relevant regulation for boutique hotels. On the other hand, in order to benefit
from the popularity of the concept, every small hotel whether suitable or not uses the title of boutique.
This problem was also discussed in 2017 Tourism Council and emphasized that the re-arrangement of
the requirement for the boutique hotel certificate within the scope of the related regulation can solve the
problem. It is thought that the evaluations about the present situation and the future of boutique hotels
that provide significant contributions to city tourism, will draw attention to the subject and contribute
to the related literature with this study which aimed to draw attention to the problems of boutique hotel
industry and to develop suggestions for the solution of the problems.

Consumer Personality Traits and Their Influence on Brand Experience and
Satisfaction

ABSTRACT

C

urrent research within the marketing literature has established that consumers do not buy goods
based on the functionalities but increasingly are making choices based on experiences with the
offers (Zarantonello, Schmitt, & Bernd, 2010). Hence, their satisfaction is largely dependent on
experience with the brands in focus. Among the first to introduce experience concept to marketing
literature were Holbrook and Hirschman, (1982) which has since gained popularity in various fields of
study including consumer behavior (Holbrook & Addis, 2001), economics (Gilmore & Pine, 1998) and
evidently marketing (Schmitt, 1999; Brakus et al., 2009).
Previous studies have established that the experiences consumers have with a brand do have effects
on how loyal they get to the brand and their satisfaction levels (Brakus et al., 2009; Pine & Gilmore,
1999). Furthermore, with reference to previous researches (see Larsen & Ketelaar, 1991; Mooradian,
1996) the relationship between individual affective states and personality has been proven, thus it gives
good ground to propose personality as a salient predictor of experiential consumption (Holbrook &
Hirschman, 1982). In addition, the assumption that experiential consumption can be predicted by
personality dimensions is strongly supported by research that has shown a strong relationship between
sensation seeking behavior and personality dimensions (Aluja, García, & García, 2003). In addition,
Gountas & Gountas, (2006) also established that personality orientations have a direct influence on the
consumer’s evaluation of service satisfaction.
There have been little or no research done on whether the influence of consumer personality traits on
the level of satisfaction is mediated by their experience with the brand. Based on the previous findings,
this study aims to examine the relationship between consumer personality traits and brand experience
whilst also using brand experience as a mediating factor between consumer personality traits and
consumer satisfaction.

Data were collected via questionnaires administered online and offline to consumers who have
patronized various brands in the hospitality service sector e.g. hotels, restaurants, airlines. The model
was further tested utilizing structural equation modelling. Findings in the research indicated that brand
experience partially mediated the effects of personality traits on consumer satisfaction whilst also
establishing strong correlations between personality traits and brand experience. Overall, the research
findings suggested that brand experience plays an important role in influencing consumer satisfaction
and has strong correlations with personality traits.
This research contributes to extant literature on the influence of personality traits on consumers’ level of
satisfaction and the role brand experience plays in mediating this effect.
Keywords: Personality Traits, Brand Experience, Satisfaction.

ABSTRACT

T

ourism sector which has become one of the fastest developing sectors in the world economy is
seen as a means of economic development for developing countries such as Turkey. In addition
to its contribution to the national income, the tourism sector plays an important role in terms of
the economy of the country with its foreign exchange income and its ability to eliminate foreign deficits
and improve the balance of payments. With its feature of creating new employment opportunities,
tourism is an important sector for countries with high unemployment. In Turkey, especially in terms of
number of active foreign tourists, tourism showed a significant improvement since the 1980s. Prediction
of number of foreigners visiting Turkey is important for policy makers, investors and businesses in
tourism sector. Artificial neural networks are machine-learning models successfully used in many tasks
including time series predictions. Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are simplest types of artificial
neural networks in which connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. Long short-term memory
(LSTM) networks are recurrent neural network architectures in which connections between the nodes
have feedback connections and cycles. This feature of LSTM networks makes LSTM architecture
suitable for sequence learning. LSTM networks are successfully used in time series forecasting, speech
recognition, handwriting recognition, human action recognition, grammar learning, robot control
and music composition. In the study number of foreigners visiting Turkey was predicted with LSTM
networks, FFNNs and Box-Jenkins model. Out-of-sample prediction performances of these models
were compared with mean absolute percentage errors. Most accurate prediction performance was
obtained with LSTM model.

ABSTRACT

I

stanbul is among the ten most visited tourist destinations in the world. This study aims at estimating
the tourism demand in Istanbul. Sample of the research consists of the top four countries that send
the highest number of tourists to Istanbul. These countries are France, Germany, Russian Federation
and the United Kingdom.
Based on the quarterly tourist arrival data for the period 2002:1-2017:4 it is possible to gauge
information about the income and price elasticities of tourism demand by analysing the other variables
used in this study. In tourism demand, the choice of a tourism destination is related to the relative price
of tourism products in that destination compared to alternative destinations and income in tourism
generating countries. ADLM Bound Test approach is applied as the empirical method in the study.
ADLM procedure provides long term regression coefficients as well as long-term coefficients in time
series models. In this respect, preliminary tests have been held for time series data. Income and price
elasticities of demand for origin countries are analysed in the short-term and long-term, respectively.
In line with the economic theory, it is expected that income and price elasticities of tourism demand is
greater than one. Tourism is a luxury good and tourists are price sensitive consumers. When there are
substitutes, price elasticity is high. However, as a city Istanbul has not a good substitute destination.
Potential substitutes can be considered as imperfect substitutes. In order to capture substitution
elasticities, price level of Greece is taken, since Athens can be substitute destination. Price index is
created by exchange rate adjusted relative price level of countries. Qualitative effects are modelled as
dummy variables. First qualitative variable is the effect of Global Economic Recession for all origin
countries second qualitative variable is assigned for Russian Federation for the year 2015 which aircraft
crises happened between Turkey and Russian Federation. Third qualitative variable controls the effect of
2016 coup plot and terror incidences. Regression results show that four lagged value of tourist arrivals
is significant. This finding supports the “Word of Mouth” hypothesis. Long-term elasticity results
reveal that German citizens do not consider İstanbul as a luxury tourism destination. For France, while
the income effect is significant, the price elasticity of demand is insignificant. Both income and price
elasticities are significant for the UK. For Russian Federation, demand is significant and consistent in
the overall framework. Findings suggest that political instabilities have stronger effect on tourism than
economic instabilities do.

Readiness the Small Town of Pangandaran – West Java, Indonesia, As a World-Class
Tourist Destination

purboyohp@gmail.com

ABSTRACT

T

he active development of national tourism can open opportunities for expansion and equitable
employment, encourage the utilization of resources owned based on local wisdom that is
characteristic of each region in Indonesia, including in terms of environmental preservation.
Pangandaran Regency is one of the Indonesian National Tourism Strategic Areas (KSPN) based on
the National Tourism Development Master Plan for 2010–2025 with tourist attractions based on the
potential diversity and natural uniqueness of the coastal landscape. Based on the West Java Province
Tourism Destination Development Plan prepared by West Java Government (2017), Pangandaran Small
City Beach Recreational Tourism Area is a priority to be developed as tourist destination that have worldclass service standards. To achieve those standards, the use of natural resources must be supported by
good human resources in order to create sustainable tourism. The consequences of tourism development
on the natural environment itself can occur in the physical environment, ecological environment, the
resources used by humans and the values of quality of life.
The number of tourists visiting Pangandaran is increasing from 2,024,026 in 2017 to 2,827,426 in 2018.
The tourists come to visit the areas directly adjacent to the sea and has the most visited tourist attraction
to date, namely Pangandaran Beach. Area of Pangandaran is 7 square kilometre with its population 11
thousand people. In this area, there are 191 lodging facilities which have 2,979 room units of various
types. The growing number of tourists is also followed by the increasing number of hotels, the greater
the utilization of water resources and the generation of garbage or waste resulting from human activities.
For this reason, it should be the responsibility of the government, private sector such as lodging business
owners and all parties that produce waste must manage their waste with the best possible system so that
it does not cause environmental pollution. As a world-class tourist destination based on the vision
of Pangandaran Regency and West Java Government, several standards are needed to be met by the
Pangandaran Beach Recreational Tourism Area. Sustainable environment is one component of the
aspect of the wealth of natural and cultural resources in determining the competitiveness of worldclass tourist destinations. In this paper Pangandaran’s readiness as a world-class tourist destination be
approached based on the study of the amenities and waste generated in Pangandaran Small City. The
results of field observations and preliminary analyzes are the amenity increases rapidly and it was not
followed by good waste management. Garbage and puddles of liquid waste are still on the road and open
space. This deficiency is one that must be solved to make Pangandaran small city become a world-class
tourist location.

ABSTRACT

C

ities are the most important tourism destination in the world. As a world tourism phenomenon,
cities are seen as a complex process related to culture, lifestyle, and a different set of requests for
holidays and travel. Tourism objects and tourist attractions are the basis for tourism, without the
presence of tourist attractions certainly in the development will experience obstacles. Urban tourism
has other distinctive characteristics, different from tourism in general, whose tourist attraction is
intended only for those who travel. Urban tourists use urban facilities that are also used by city dwellers
as a tourist attraction.
The economic impact of tourism activities or various economic activities can be grouped into three
categories, namely direct, indirect and continued benefits. The priority concept that can be optimized
in the city of Jakarta today is urban ecotourism. That’s because Jakarta requires a unique appeal and
requires a better green environment. This research study focuses on the condition of the city of Jakarta
and the impact of urban tourism on the local economy. The method used is the descriptive method.
By sampling methods Quota sampling techniques using Sampling Insidential election. In assessing the
perception of using Rating Scale and analyzing the economic impact. The results of this research are
the development strategy of urban ecotourism area which the order of priorities is the quality of human
resource development, urban planning, regulations, integrated transportation, and services. Results are
expected to be used as input to government policymakers, private sector and investors in developing
tourism.

ABSTRACT

T

he effect of incivility on employee’s psychological wellbeing has attracted attention, bringing
scholars from different fields. Customer and supervisor incivility remains a serious issue where
cases of uncivil behaviour are becoming burdensome to organizations. Such behaviour continues to
accumulate costs in the hospitality industry and remains the influencing factors for employees’ emotional
exhaustion. For instance, the effects of uncivil act is evident in frontline employees, in the manufacturing
industry (Wu et al., 2012), in restaurants (Han, Bonn, & Cho, 2016), property-management companies
(Miner et al., 2012), universities (Sliter, Sliter, & Jex, 2012), hotels (Alola et al., 2019; Alola, Avci, & Ozturen,
2018), health sector (Trudel & Reio, 2011), and the financial sector (Abubakar et al., 2018). Incivility is a
rude, insensitive deviant behaviour, either verbal or non-verbal, targeted toward another person to cause
deliberate harm. The Nigerian hotel industry is not an exemption to cases of uncivil behaviour, as constantly
is becoming the order of the day in the hospitality industry. This study draws from the Conservation of
Resource Theory (COR) (Hobfoll, 2002) to investigate the objectives. The study aims to verify the effects
of customer incivility (CUST) and supervisor incivility (SUPE) on hotel frontline employee’s turnover
intention (TOIN) and job satisfaction (JSAT) through the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion
(EXXT). The study applied a total of 328 questionnaires from frontline employees of four- and five-star
hotels in Nigeria, specifically in the commercial city of Lagos and the national capital Abuja. The sample
size was determined according to the researcher’s judgment since there was no available data to determine
the survey population (Darvishmotevali, Arasli, & Kilic, 2017). The judgmental sampling method is the
method appropriate for the study. Twelve hypotheses were developed for the study. The study will apply
SPSS and AMOS 20.0 statistical software in conducting the analyses. Ten hypotheses were accepted, two
hypotheses were rejected. Surprisingly, there was no mediating effect of emotional exhaustion on customer
and supervisor incivility and JSAT. The researchers suggest effective managerial framework like employee
and customer training to combat incivility in the hotel industry. The study applies a cross-sectional data
collection style, therefore, generalizing the findings of this study should be done with caution.

Social Production of Street Food Markets in London
Fatos Ozkan ERCIYAS

ABSTRACT

T

his study aims to contribute to the urban food tourism literature by advancing an understanding of
how street food vending reveals processes of ‘place-making’ that shape the social, political, economic
and cultural landscape of London as a developed urban city as well as a thriving marketplace
empowered by its rich multicultural food culture and one of the world’s leading tourism destinations.
Street vending is a widespread practice in densely populated areas in both developing and developed
countries (Bhowmik, 2010; Bromley, 2000). Street food vending forms a source of income and
employment for vendors (who often operate within the informal economy), as a result of the lack of
barriers to employment (Burnett and Newman, 2014). It is generally assumed that the demand for street
food is fuelled by a fundamental need to provide necessary sustenance in an economical manner (Sharit
and Bhowmik, 2005). This study focuses on the unprecedented consumption of street food predicated
on experiential and hedonistic fulfilment (Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982). In line with this approach,
London street food markers are chosen as a context. The scene of street food markets in London different
than traditional street markets of developing countries. In London, food vendors also attract travellers,
tourists, shoppers, students, worshippers – all of whom harbour different culinary preference and
perceptions of street-food. Long (1998) observes how culinary tourists seek to experience the cultural
‘other’ through food as a hedonic pursuit involving the thrill of the unknown.
I will adopt Lefebvre’s (1991), Social Production of Space to examine street food vending as a theoretical
framework. While I apply this triplite to this study, I position social-spatial practice to see how street
vending produces and reproduces daily social relations and experiences between vendors and various
stakeholders; representations of space to understand the ways in which council and urban planners
represent London; representational space to examine how the symbolic meaning and images are lived
and subverted by vendors and its various stakeholders.
Ethnography is used for this study, and I aim to understand movement concerning mind, body and the
environment with the help of interviews, mobile methods and sensory participant observation.
To sum up, in this study, I explore how the social relations between different stakeholders are spatially
played out. I aim to find out the multilayer of meaning and use of space by various stakeholders and how
these meanings and uses contests with each other by using ethnographic methods.

Horizontal Individualism, Authenticity and International Tourist Behaviors

ABSTRACT

D

espite, the four decades passed till the first attempts to adopt authenticity to tourism discipline,
(Maccanell, 1973), the authenticity is still a current issue which Urry (1990) states its pivotal role
in tourism literature. Authenticity is defined with notions, namely, being real, reliable, original,
direct, and genuine. (Ram et. al, 2016:111). In other words, it is an experience which individual is
seeking to interact with their Being via themselves, objects, and their experiences surrounding them
(Knuddsen et al, 2016). In tourism literature, seeking for new experiences and authenticity theoretically
is related to high degrees of individualism (Kim ve Lee, 2000:157; Yeoman et al., 2007: 1131-1132,
Peterson, 2005). Additionally, the tendency to be an authentic tourist is also related to individualism
(Yeoman et al., 2007:1131). Tourists demand on the products and services which provide a sense of
identity and self-realization. This tendency becomes stronger gradually in generations (Peterson,
2005:1094).
Besides the universal values, the cultural context that the tourists are embedded makes an impact on
tourism involvement. In other respects, the empirical research on the cultural context of authenticity in
the tourism literature was missing. This paper attempts to fill this specific literature gap by examining
the effects of individualist values on authenticity perceptions of tourists. Relying on Triandis’s (2001)
individualism dimensions, a theoretical model was designed. The model depends on how individuals
perceive their positions in their embodied values. A significant attribute which distinguishes several
types of individualism is the positions towards power. The horizontal cultures focus on equality when
the vertical cultures emphasize on hierarchies. Therefore, in horizontal individualism, “all people are
equal” and “every individual is unique”. However, in vertical individualism, the differentiation and
“being the best” are the main values (Triandis, 2001: 36). To that end, a structural equation model was
designed and analyzed via the data obtained from 674 international tourists who visited Cappadocia
Region. When the demographic and descriptive analysis was done by SPSS 16.0, SmartPLS 3.1 was
employed to analyze the theoretical construction. We found that individualistic values have an impact
on both the object-based and existentialist authenticity perceptions of tourists. Additionally, the paper
reports the effects of authenticity on tourist satisfaction and the satisfaction predicted the behavioral
intentions of tourists.
This study contributes the literature by suggesting the cross-cultural context of authenticity which is not
undertaken via empirical research previously. Findings indicate the horizontal individualism predicts
authenticity perceptions. Accordingly, interacting with oneself and tourism products with a sense of
autonomy makes an impact on one’s perception of authenticity. The results suggest that planning and
managing cultural sites highly depend on cross-cultural behavior. The authorities might retain the
importance of individualism vs. collectivism when providing touristic goods and services.

The Core Principles for an Effective City Tour Design
Orhan YABANCI
Res.Assist.Dr., Eskisehir Osmangazi University
oyabanci@ogu.edu.tr

ABSTRACT

T

ravel is a service-intensive business that contributes to both global and local economies. As to
the World Tourism Organization, the international tourist arrivals reached over a billion. These
arrivals are fulfilled by various travel and tour companies that make billions of dollars in annual
revenue. The conspicuous economy is generated through the close collaboration of the stakeholders,
particularly tour companies, hotels, governments, scholars, and local vendors.
One cannot deny the contribution of city tours to the striking success of the travel industry. A city tour is
one of the main types of tours that refers to the travel organization designed to make people experience
the good vibes of a city. This concept is worth studying as being a contributor to economic growth.
A successful city tour thrives on strong design. A well-cultivated design is essential for good moments of
truth during touring activity. Henceforth, one should ponder the principles for a quality city tour design
from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In conclusion, there are some concise inferences to
consider when designing an effective tour described as follows;
—

Putting security first; pin security on the forefront of the agenda as it is one of the main concerns
of life. Avoid congested areas as much as possible for the sanity of both tourists and the residents.
Areas of crowds, public protests or upheavals might engage the tourist group in turmoil or even a
terror attack.

—

Learning from the past; infer from the past. Learn from previous experience, whether a failure or
a success, to improve and maintain future tour organizations.

—

Employing talents; people are the most critical source for organizational activity. Hence, hire
competent people and build agile teams to carry out challenging tour operations.

—

Following the dynamics; plan the tour by considering the specific dynamics of the city such as
traffic, crowded areas, urban entertainment districts, local social life, and regulations.

—

Discovering the spirit; design the tour to consist with the vibration of the city, so that it creates
unique moments of truth in due course. For example, it should make a tourist remark — “Now, I
testify that this city is something special.”

—

Being peculiar; every city has its distinctive features that no other city can imitate. Therefore find
the most authentic assets of the city and have them as aces in the hole of the program.

—

Being tourist-centric; never ignore the expectations of the tourist group. Tailor the tour to the
common inclinations of the group so that it conforms well to their expectations.

—

Playing fair; be responsible for the service you provide. Care for your customers. Further, represent
the destination as much as it deserves.

—

Marketing matters; marketing is at the core of many businesses and no exception for travel. Hence,
find the potential strengths of the city and promote them for commercial use.

ABSTRACT

T

his study investigates quantitatively which European Union (EU) countries as well as Turkey have
similar structure in the tourism sector. The study employs time series clustering methods on the
data set, which has monthly frequency, composed of foreigners’ arrivals at tourist accommodation
establishments in EU countries. Although the topic is interesting by itself, the findings have a practical
use. It will provide information about who is the fiercest competition of whom in attracting foreign
tourists for EU countries. In that regard the study will also provide quantitative information on the
closest competitor of Turkey for the foreign tourists. Hence policy makers in Turkey may find it easier
to develop tourism polices to increase Turkey’s international competitiveness in this sector.

ABSTRACT

T

his study aims to assess the future climates of Palandöken Ski Resort, one of Turkey’s largest and
oldest, and the City of Erzurum, a historical town dating back to 4000 BC on the ancient Silk Road.
Ski tourism is under major threat due to spatiotemporal shrinkage of snow cover. Such effect
negatively influences natural snow reliability, hence the financial/economic viability, of ski destinations.
To cope with this, many ski area operators worldwide have started to install snowmaking systems.
However such measure comes with high financial costs and increased environmental footprints as
well as technical limitations due to snow production impracticability at high wet bulb temperatures.
Therefore, other adaptation strategies need to be considered and diversification of the tourism
product is a good alternative for vulnerable destinations. In this sense, as an alternative/supplement to
winter tourism, usually urban tourism does not offer a good offer as ski resorts are usually located at
remote areas at very high altitudes. However, some resorts are most fortunate due to their immediate
proximity to city centers with a strong urban tourism potential as in the case of Palandöken, Erzurum.
In order to utilize urban tourism as an alternative/supplement, the climatic comfort for urban sightseeing
should be assessed in addition to snow reliability assessments for winter tourism. For this purpose,
the Mountain Tourism Meteorological and Snow Indicators (MTMSI) and the Holiday Climate Index
(HCI:Urban) projections of the recently launched Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) European
Tourism are utilized. The MTMSI application provides the user with historical and future skiable snow
durations per 100 m elevation at the NUTS 3 level while the HCI:Urban application displays the climatic
suitability of European towns for urban tourism for each of the four seasons. In this study, the seasonal
HCI:Urban climatologies of the City of Erzurum are coupled with the snow reliability projections of
Palandöken Ski Resort. The results indicate whether the climatic comfort for urban sightseeing outplays
ski tourism as an alternative for the winter season and/or complements the main ski product for yearround tourism throughout the 21st century and according to different Representative Concentration
Pathways (RCPs).
Key words: Winter Tourism, Urban Tourism, Ski Resort, Climate Services, Climate Change Adaptation,

This study is part of the project “Determination of Climate Change Adaptation Strategies for Winter
Tourism in Erzurum with a Participatory Approach” (Grant no. 118K191) funded by the Scientific and
Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK). The authors would like to thank TÜBİTAK for

ABSTRACT

T

his paper reviews the literature and identifies city characteristics as a new developing destination.
Also it is a primary research. The purpose of this research is based on the evolution of city
characteristics of Van which became a popular destination especially for Iranian tourists
visiting in recent five years. Hence, the study analyses the destination characteristics and investigates
the perceptions of Iranian tourists with relation among characteristics, satisfaction and repurchase
behaviour. Research was conducted in 2017 in Van and data collected by the questionnaire form which
contains the statements in Likert scale (5) derived from the literature. 400 questionnaire were distributed
to the tourists originally from Iran and face to face contacted. Only 370 form returned and 292 of those
questionnaire forms were considered for statistical analysis since some of statements were not fill in.
The form and statement were translated by an expert into Persian from Turkish. Reliability and factor
analysis has been found reliable and satisfactory. Some statements which has weak factor loads were
eliminated from the scale and then statistical analysis were implemented. Natural, historical, social
cultural values and distance from origin place were found the most significant elements of city tourism.
At the end of the statistical analysis it has been found that the results showed the significantly correlated
among some dimensions. Also it has been found that a significant regression among satisfaction and
other dimensions in addition to the significant regression impacts of satisfaction and attractions on
repurchase behaviour of tourists.

ABSTRACT

T

he interaction between economic and political decisions taken by countries for various purposes,
and the regulations made within the scope of fiscal and monetary policies have an impact on the
tourism industry as well as in all economic areas. Therefore, the aim of this study is determined
to evaluate the relationship between economic and tourism policies. The republican era was discussed
in five periods. In Atatürk period (1923-1938), the basic economic policy is the foundation of the
republic and economic independency. In this era, tourism policy was based on the governmental and
managerial organization and promotion of the industry.After the II. World War (1940-1960), Turkey
applied conservative economic policies and at the same time attempted to implement liberalization. The
government has worked to improve travel opportunities and increase investments in tourism. In 1963,
Turkey started to prepare central development plans and implement policies through these plans. In the
first period of central planning (1960-1980), main concern was planned development on the economy
side, and boosting number of tourists to increase tourism revenues on the tourism side. In the period
of 1980-2000, liberalization was in the center of economic policies. Along this era, the government
implemented policies to increase investments, number of tourists and tourism revenues in tourism.
After 2000, the central planning approached changed from strict planning to a more flexible, necessity
based strategic approach. Turkey started the EU harmonization process and prepared a special plan
for the 100. anniversary of the republic to improve tourism activities. To investigate the relationship
between economic and tourism policies, tourism investments, as the most concrete reflection of
economic policies on tourism policies were analyzed based on these eras. Bai-Perron (BP) and Carrion-i
Silvestre (CiS) multiple structural breaks tests were employed to analyze the number of accommodation
establishments and the number of beds for both tourism investment and tourism operation licensed
investments by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, in addition to the total number of establishments
and beds using yearly data for the period 1970-2018. All the series show multiple structural breaks,
some at the times of policy shifts, and some after widespread economic crises. Structural break dates
obtained from the BP test were interpreted within the framework of the policies for the relevant period
and recommendations were discussed.
Keywords: Economic policy, Tourism policy, Structural breaks, Bai-Perron, Carrion-i Silvestre.

ABSTRACT

P

lanning a strategy to attract visitors to a destination, whether resort, city, region, or country by
applying the appropriate marketing concepts is called the marketing of tourism. When marketing
a product, the focus is placed on the “four P’s” of product, place, price and promotion. Yet these
four P’s cannot be used as a standard strategy for marketing a city. Because only by travelling, a city
can be experienced or consumed as a product since the product is also the place. Yettravelling takes
considerable time and money. Thus, if the positive image of the city is not communicatedeffectively,
people won’t take the risk of visiting. That’s why it is suggested that when developing a marketing plan to
attract tourists, the emphasis must be equally on developing the city as a product/place worth visiting and
also promoting what the city has to offer. There are many ideas in the literature on how to package and
brand a city as a tourist product by using a city’s already existing tourist attractions, distinctive cultural
features, natural beauty, and/or heritage. These unique features, plus the available tourist services/event
creates the image of the city. This image has to include beauty, excitement, the lifestyles, ethnic culture,
values of its inhabitants. İn short this entire experience must be promoted when marketing a city.
This study which is apractice-based research inquires how this can be achieved? Can we create a
product/event that will provide people with a multiple sensory experiencing of a city, before the people
actually visit the city? How is it possible to compose multiple sensory encounters creating an experience
of living the colors, sounds, tastes, smells of a city and initiating a positive memory about a city before
people decide to visit the city? “A Trip to Bursa: A Multi-Sensory Experience” is the result of our inquiry.

Agri-Tourism Potential of Gazipaşa as an Alternative to Urban Tourism
Gözdegül BAŞER
Assist.Prof.Dr., Antalya Bilim University

ABSTRACT

T

ourists travel for many reasons as they are attracted by many historical, natural, socio-cultural
attributes of tourism destinations. Tourism is a global industry with an average growth rate of 3.9 %
on the global arena (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2019). Majority of tourism activites take
place in big cities which are mostly investigated under urban tourism research. Urban tourism has taken
attention since the past 20 years as a field of academic studies (Ashworth and Page, 2011). This progress
can prevail theoretical debates as well as practical research incredementally. The high urbanization rates
may be one of the reasons for the rapid increase in urban tourism research globally. As an example, in
2018, 55.3 % of the world’s population lived in cities, whereas for Turkey, this figure is reported as 75 %
(World Bank, 2019). However, tourism activities need to provide alternative and sustainable varities. Agritourism (or namely agro-tourism) is one of the sustainable tourism alternatives. Agricultural tourism has
many environmental benefits such as the protection of rural areas and natural resources, the promotion of
environmentally friendly agricultural practices and the improvement of agricultural production (Barbieri
2013; Brown and Reeder 2007; Che et al. 2005). Phillip et al. (2010) states that agricultural activities for
tourists can be examined in various levels. The levels may be passive as an observer of agri-cultural activities
or direct or indirect involvement. Agri-cultural tourism involves a wide variety of activities and can be
combined with other forms of tourism as a package. In addition, agricultural tourism can be considered as
one of the important alternatives of sustainable tourism.
Gazipaşa district of Antalya, Turkey has mainly an agricultural economy. Although being in proximity
to tourism destinations and governing natural, historical, cultural attractions, Gazipaşa preserved its
originality in its traditions and agriculture and has not progressed in terms of tourism. Gazipaşa is only
44 km. away from Alanya which is a very popular tourism district located in Antalya province. The district
was declared as a tourism zone in 1989 and Gazipaşa airport was put into operation (Aşık, 2016). This
research aims to find out the agri-cultural potential of Gazipaşa . The research is designed as a qualitative
methodology. Two focus group studies are made with a total of 17 farmers. Semi-structured interviews are
made with government officers as well as civil society organization authorities. The results point out an
important potential to be developed with many factors to be considered. The farmers are mostly willing to
be involved in agri-cultural activities, however they need information as well as better infrastructure. There
may be u-pick activities and participation in village life. More festivals can be organized in addition to the
current pomegranate festival. Some of the farmers are not in favor of offering home accomodation whereas
some of them are willing to host tourists. Governmental officers mention the need for accomodation
availabilities and think that agri-tourism can only be developed in presence of other hotels. The paper
presents detailed information related to the agri-cultural potential of Gazipaşa. The findings may help for
the future strategies to be followed.
Keywords: Agri-tourism, Sustainability, Rural Development, Gazipaşa, Tourism Policy.

ABSTRACT

I

n this study, a qualitative evaluation was made based on some examples. There are numerous travel
writings, travel narratives, travel programs and geography and cultural documentaries in the media.
The media is very interested in tourism and has positive or negative contributions to the media.
This study discusses the productions of the so-called media on tourism and tourism issues and draws
attention to the positive and negative messages of the media that affect tourism. In the modern era fed
by popular culture, the most common and effective instruments of communication and entertainment
are the media. Media is usually composed of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and the internet.
People follow the developments in their immediate surroundings, countries, the world and the universe
through the media, as well as sharing via the internet and satisfying their egos. The media includes
everything from politics to economy, from private lives to global problems. Tourism is one of the most
profitable sectors of the modern era. Millions of people around the world are constantly traveling
and exploring tourist areas. The main sources of information for people interested in tourism are
brochures, promotional films, especially the internet and other tools. The media are the main reference
and information sources of the modern era. People often turn to the media to have information and
ideas on different topics. Media are the most common instruments of popular culture and all popular
topics. Media has the opportunity to collect and convey a wide range of information and impressions
through its wide networks. The media is often interested in tourism and tourist attractions because of
it is a popularity. Television, which is the most watched media, frequently introduces touristic regions,
features interesting cultures and traditions, and shows delicious food and localities. Some travel
publications in the media, memories from different regions, history and culture publications, curiosity
and interest in people. People who are interested in different cultures, geographies, different traditions
and especially local tastes participate in tourism activities. Different geographies, different cultures,
interesting traditions, tastes that have never been tasted attract almost everyone’s interest and create
the desire to experience these experiences. National and local governments, which constantly promote
publicity to stimulate tourism movements for national and regional gain, often use the media. Tourism
is one of the sectors that earn a lot without spending much money. In this context, the influence of
the media is undoubtedly strong and every organization tries to benefit from the media. The most
easily accessible media, the internet and television, are the instruments that attract the most geography,
culture and food that attract people. On the Internet, people share their travel experiences, especially
attractive photos also contribute to tourism movements. Although the negative comments shared on
the internet also adversely affect the tourism movements, they make the tourism shares realistic and
cause the business owners to correct the mistakes. The horrific events in the news broadcasts, clashes,
wars, rights violations, improper images and dirty spaces are the messages that adversely affect the
tourism movements. The news and publications about negative events in a country, instability, strained
diplomatic relations, violent behaviors towards foreigners, religious and racial bigotry, cultural problems
directly affect tourism. Tourism is the sector where security and peace are the primary condition, where
tourists seek safe places and peace, and want to relax and have fun. Every publication that violates
security and peace in the media has a negative impact on tourism.
Key Words: Tourism, Media, Broadcast, Internet, Attraction.

ABSTRACT

A

s a center of economy and management, cities have a historical and cultural past as old as the
transition to the settled life of mankind. Throughout history, cities have been the center of
societies’ change and social and economic life. The constant change of social and economic life
leads to the corruption of the social and cultural fabric of the cities, and also leads to the globalization
of other cities. Globalization forces people to work harder, to produce more and consume more. This
rapidity not only shapes the economic life but also ensures that the social, cultural and environmental
dynamics of cities are aligned according to the rapidity phenomenon.
Rapidity is a concept against which the concept of calm is opposed and it is thought that this
understanding has emerged from the idea that it constitutes an atmosphere of turmoil in the world.
However, in many settlements where globalization and rapidity cannot be achieved, calmness is seen as
a routine of life. The reason for this is that in these regions, rapid living, emerging as a natural pressure
of globalization, the dependence on technology, the examples that constitute the majority of life are at
the lowest level, and having a comfortable and calm environment which is a part of traditional life can
be prioritized.
This study aims to examine the importance of the slow city concept considering fact that the world is
under pressure for a fast development, globalization and standardization. This study has a potential to
show that slow city can be a tool to solve economic, social and environmental problems stemming from
globalization. In other words, focusing on the tenets of slow city, this study will reveal an alternative
model to fast growing and globalization in the context of cities.
This study is based on an extensive literature review. According to literature review, it can be briefly stated
that Slow City (Cittaslow) is an alternative sustainable urban model developed for cities that are based
on the quality of life and do not reach a certain size in order to prevent globalization, the texture of cities,
the standardization of lifestyle and local characteristics, and to realize the environmentally sensitive
and tourism-based local development. Slow city movement represents resistance to globalization. Slow
living; slowly rushing, with the way the Latin people used it, Speed is moving away from the self and
slowness gets closer to itself, and thanks to the possibilities of today and the future, means to benefit
from the heritage and accumulation of the past.

ABSTRACT

T

atars who came to Turkey years ago, and settled in many different regions have a rich culinary
culture. The inhabitants lived in the Omsk region of Siberia, were forced to emigrate during
the tsarist Russia. They settled in Konya in 1910. They are called Uzbek in Turkistan, Sibirek or
Buharins of Siberia, also called Tatars in Turkey. The majority of the food consumed by Tatars as they
migrate from cold countries consists of pastry foods.

The aim of this study is to investigate the pastries which are indispensable tastes of Uzbek Tatars living
in Böğrüdelik neighborhood of Cihanbeyli district of Konya. The study was conducted with qualitative
research method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with five source people who lived in
Böğrüdelik neighborhood or who had lived for a long time before. Previously prepared questions about
some of the local pastries were asked to the source persons. Interviews were analyzed and reported.
In the scope of this study; “beliç”, “beremiç”, “kaysıbörek” and “bavursak” pastry are investigated. It is
understood from these pastries that “beliç” is made on special occasions and invitations. “Bavursak” is
held every holiday (bairam). Tatars living in the neighborhood of Böğrüdelik do not only make pastries
on special occasions but also any time. In addition, it was found that there were families who consumed
pies once a week or ten days. As a matter of fact, it can be said that pastries are important for Tatar folks.
So much so that they did not marry the girl who used to able to cook 50 kinds of pastry in Siberia.
The country (Siberia) was very cold. That’s why they always put meat in the pies. When they had fried
meat and pastry, they never got cold. Furthermore, the preparation of pastries requires many people.
It strengthens communication between women cooking or baking and provides social solidarity. This
makes it easier for single male mothers to see the skills of young girls. This division of labor is still
continuing at the weddings of Böğrüdelik village. Especially for the production of “beliç” women come
together in the village to help the wedding owner and prepare the “beliç”. “Beremiç (peremeç)” is cooked
in two ways as fermented and unfermented. According to sources, it is seen that there is a “peremeç”
prepared with potatoes. In this way, the potatoes are peeled, washed and boiled. Mashed potatoes are
cooked. Add the onions that fried in oil. It is fried in oil as in meat “peremeç”. “Beliç” pastry is cooked
in the ovens designed by the villagers. “Beliç” is an Uzbek pastry is cooked from unfermented dough
consisting of beef and rice. It is served as a main course at Tatar weddings in Böğrüdelik village. It is
defined as a pie that is baked in the oven by opening the dough with one or more kinds of material and
covering it with the dough again.
In the following studies, it is recommended to make standardization in touristic facilities and to carry
out educational activities.
Keywords: Tatar cuisine, Uzbek foods, Pastry, Borek, Gastronomy.

ABSTRACT

T

oday, people are travelling to different countries and their variable cities for the touristic purposes.
Each person is enjoying from different types of tourism such as environmental, cultural,
health, adventure, recreational and religious. According to the peoples’ expectations, particular
destinations can be selected. When they are visiting new places, tourists are supposed to learn about
the different cultures and their historic and cultural heritages. Thus, heritage tourism is one of the most
preferred types of the tourism. It contains natural, historic and cultural resources of countries. Cultural
heritage is one of the most significant values of a country, which is the reflection of its history, culture
and architecture. During the history, under the influence of the changing political, socio-cultural,
economic factors, the cultural heritage has been composed layer by layer. Governments and people
of countries have been making efforts to preserve cultural heritage. This attempt is very important for
carrying the cultural heritage to the future. Architectural buildings and monuments are most important
resources of countries, which creates the significant part of the tangible cultural heritage and reflect
about their background. Historical buildings and monuments, which are the mirrors of a country, also
constitute its identity. Thus, the conservation of them has a great importance for the promotion of the
countries and marketing of their cities. Nowadays, different countries in the world are in deep studies
to create some policies for renovation, restoration or re-functioning of the historic buildings to re-use
in the contemporary period. These efforts can change the quality of the cities and increase the tourist
attraction in the old and historic parts.
Famagusta is a city close to the Mediterranean Sea, which is located on the east coast of Cyprus. The
history of the city goes back to 274 BC. Famagusta harbor was one of the most important ports of the
ancient period. It was used as a gateway for trade to Europe. Its rich cultural and historic background
has been reflected to the architecture. Today, it is possible to observe great number of historic buildings
from different architectural periods of Cyprus in the old town of Famagusta. Lusignan (1192-1489),
Venetian (1489-1571), Ottoman (1571-1878) and British (1878-1960) are the most significant ones. In
this study, it is aimed to discuss the impact of architectural heritage on the tourist attraction and city
marketing. It is also intended to discuss and present the significant historic buildings from the different
time periods, which are visited and used for the touristic purposes in Famagusta. These buildings will
be categorized according to the uses and the way of conservation. On the base of this, mainly literature
review and physical analysis methods are used for this research. At the end of the study, it is expected
to provide a general review about Famagusta’s historic buildings and touristic activities, which are
supporting the tourist attraction and city marketing.
Keywords: Tourism, Architectural Heritage, Conservation, City Marketing, Walled City of Famagusta.

INTRODUCTION
The meaning of the “tour” is that the travelers returned to their countries when they come to the point
to answer their expectations of this travel. They get seriously motivated by the fund investment and also
cultural purpose from the intention country that is far away from their home countries (MacCannell,
01
2013). In the modern period and modern type of tourism, a social group of people was selected for the
practicing of cultural tourism in terms of economic position and education (Richards, 2001). The function
of tourism changes from ancient times to the present. It is transferred from entertainment to national
income (Diamond,1977). Nowadays developing tourism is one of the main goals of the countries with
specifically archeological sites (Brohman, 1996). Tourism is categorized in different types in the present
world such as ecotourism, leisure, business tourism, family visiting and others (Goeldner, 2007).

Architectural heritage is consisting of various
elements and buildings belong to the different
periods. They are sorted as traditional and historic
monuments and buildings, handicrafts and
museums, old streets and urban spaces (Timothy,
2003). In the contemporary period, one of the
main tourism fields is related to the recognition
of the cultural heritage of the cities and also the
appreciation of the cultural heritage (Richards,
2007). The collaboration between tourism and
heritage has some advantages and disadvantages to
the cities. Some of the advantages are creating more
jobs in the cities, economic growth achievement
for the citizens and government, improvement
of the urban infrastructure, improvement of the
facilities in cities specifically old part of the town,
make the heritage areas be livable, increase the
public spaces, connect the old part of the city to the
new part of the city, restoration and conservation
of the old buildings and spaces and reinforcement
between the local identity and tourists. However, on
the other hand, the threats are related to the poor
quality of renovation and restoration, not using
suitable materials, and destruction an alteration
in heritage monuments, spaces, and buildings. All
of the mentioned disadvantages are harmful to
sustainability in the city (Dümcke, 2013).
The fact of conservation is that it shouldn’t touch
the identity of the objects, spaces or buildings. These
elements should keep in their actual shape, size,
material, colour, and texture. They can be repaired
or re function to be liveable and reusable as a piece
of art belongs to history (Jokilehto, 2017).
The conservation and restoration which is applied
to the architectural heritage can change the historic
part of the city. This issue has a positive effect on the
absorption of the heritage tourists to specifically this
part of the town (Larkham, 2002). The other main
factor that the travelers in the contemporary period
are looking for is good quality transportation and
accommodation system. A combination of good
quality and professional restoration, conservation,
accommodation, transportation, livable events, and
services affect the improvement of city marketing
(Kotler, 2002). Marketing specifically in tourism
has a major role. Architectural heritage can be a
powerful element to improve the marketing of the
cities. A combination of the artifact elements next
to architectural heritages and social events improve
the tourism heritage of a city. The powerful policy
of tourism can effect on the improvement of city
marketing. People can share and present their
culture, nature, and history with the tourist from all
parts of the world to show and keep their culture
(Timothy, 2011).

Famagusta as a port city that belongs to different
historical periods such as Lusignan (1192-1489),
Venetian (1489-1571), Ottoman (1571-1878) and
British (1878-1960) is a good tourism destination.
In the old town of Famagusta, different architectural
heritage buildings and monuments are located which
have different functions such as cafes, restaurants,
bars, castle, bazar, churches, museums, shops, and
others. Some of these historic buildings renovated
and conserved in their original use. However, some
of them were conserved by new uses. Generally, they
transfer to the cafés, bars, restaurants and shops. The
old town of Famagusta is a kind of outdoor museum.
Different activities such as theater plays, music
concerts and festivals are taken place in different
times. In this research architectural heritage in the
Walled City of Famagusta is analyzed in terms of
touristic uses. It mentions about their history and
period of conservation. Besides, in this study, the
architectural buildings that change their functions
during the contemporary period are discussed.

LITERATURE REVIEW
The Role of Architectural Heritage
on Tourism and Marketing of a City
The world tourism is originated by the word “Grand
tour “that belongs to the eighteen century. In that
period the artists and the people who are loved in
literature, art and history from different countries
traveled to Europe as a continent which is specified
as high cultural and architectural cities in the world.
Specifically, the mentioned people choose the Italian
peninsula and Rome city as a curio and classical
antiquity of the Europe continent. The ancient
world and history go to Roman civilization. The
culture of Roman people goes to Renaissance and
Rome city is a well rich sample for the ones that love
historical heritage culture, classic arts and become
an inspiration for them for artistic production of
that time (Choay, 1992).
Heritages and specifically architectural heritage
are the history and culture of the past that the
government and the citizens try to preserve for the
present. They should be also kept and inherited
for the future. Heritage shaped in different social,
cultural and political periods that connect the
present period to the past (Ashworth, 2013).
UNESCO’s did a convention in 1972 about
the world’s natural and cultural heritage and the
protection of this issue. UNESCO classifies the
cultural heritage as Sustainable development
and cultural heritage tourism is the World Trade

Organization (WTO) strategy from the beginning
of the 1970s. “Tourism: the conservation of world
heritage for the new millennium” is the motto of
the 1999 year for the World Tourism Day. It was
also issued a joint memorandum on the “Tourism
and the conservation of cultural heritage” in 1999
between the Organization of World Heritage Cities,
the council of Europe and UNESCO which is done
in Khiva-Uzbekistan (Mc Kercher, 2002).
Based on the variable studies on “cultural
tourism” culture is one of the main factors in
these days related to tourism in a different part of
the world. Also, it is one of the largest and most
developed categories in a different type of tourism on
the world scale (Richards, 2001). This development
brings different opportunities and demands to
increase the number of conserving monuments and
traditional buildings which is not usable, less valued
in the contemporary period. Also, it can bring
back life to historic and traditional environments.
This development causes more appreciation for the
historical environment and understanding more
about the local culture and cross-cultural relation.
Architectural buildings cover the important
part of the heritage in the historic and traditional
environments. Different countries in the world
are obeying the conservation policies to protect
the cultural identity of the past and offer it in the
professional condition as a reference to the future
generation. The policy of conservation is to be
outstanding and to be unique. In addition to these,
the artefacts and architectural buildings that are
conserved shouldn’t lose their identity.
In recent periods, the importance of the cultural
heritage and protection of the heritages gain more
credit from the countries. An increase in the
number of heritage tourists in the world causes
the concern of the countries to create policies to
protect the heritages. They try to protect conserved
architectural buildings and artefacts much more
than before.
The International Council on Monuments and
Sites (ICOMOS) adopted an International Charter
on Cultural Tourism in 1976. The extraordinary
growth of tourism over the last decades of the
twentieth century led ICOMOS to review the
Charter; a new text was adopted in 1999, more
suitable to the demands of the moment. This
introduces concepts and recommendations related
to the proper interpretation and transmission of
heritage values and meanings, with the need to
consider the tourism use of heritage as a tool for the
integral development of host communities through
the idea of participatory planning involving all
stakeholders (Roders, 2011).

Heritage tourism is consisting of two chapters.
One of them is cultural tourism and the other one
is eco-tourism. The quality of cultural and natural
environment affects tourism. Heritage tourism is
including visiting museums, architectural heritage
buildings, national parks, and art galleries (Ritchie,
2003).
There are two main policies related to the
preservation of architectural heritage and urban.
The first one is based on developing the aesthetic and
efficiency of the inherited architecturally planning
unit. The second aim is related to the urban fabric
and the processing of the building gets conserved.
They are not allowing harming architectural
heritage. The challenge is in between of these two
factors is to find sustainable tourism development
(Orbasli, 2002). Sustainable tourism development
happened due to a balance between three factors.
These factors categorized as protection of nature,
economic benefit, and identity of the culture of the
specific city. Cultural heritage has a positive potential
effect for the city related to two main factors. One of
them is based on social impact and the other one is
related to the economic. Cultural heritage specified
on the identity and support of culture. It is bringing
harmonies between the people and also helps to
renew tourism (Mc Kercher, 2002).
The international conservation guideline
and charters try to create some principles due to
keeping the nature of the architectural heritage
and keeping the original form. These principles
are based on an ethical code. These ethical codes
should be based on moral principles. They can help
the conservators to do their job in the best way to
appreciate and understand cultural heritage. These
basic ethical codes are standards for conservation
in the international charter. They are categorized as;
1. Deeply study, analyzing and recording before the
intervention 2. The minimum change in the fabric
of historic places. 3. Bring the risk to the minimum
level due to damage, the uncertainty of performance
and loss through intervention. 4. Make the
interventions that possible to reversible. 5. Retention
of the original structure. 6. Using distinguishable or
distinctive material for the new additional part. 7.
Sympathy in use and interpretation. 8. Respect for
the place and its quality. 9. Use the original materials
and standard in workmanship and 10. Durability in
the result of conservation and finishing (Mansfield,
01 the governments, policy
2008). These are guiding
makers, designers and the local people to improve
the quality of a city.

Conservation works on the architectural
buildings and monuments allow the tourists and the
residence to enjoy more about this fascinating place.
The progress of conservation in the architectural
heritage part of the Walled City of Famagusta
is in progress in recent years. These cause the
improvement in the number of tourist in this part of
the city. Increase in the number of tourist cause city
marketing. Also, city marketing affects the income
condition of locals.
There is a dual mayoral office in Famagusta
that the established of this office goes back to a
century. This office has encouragement support for
the conservation and improvement of the historic
part of the walled city. In this area when each
conservation project finished, it makes the citizens
and government inspired to have more protective
historic sites in the Walled City of Famagusta
and bring back the power to this part of the city.
In parallel, this issue causes the area to get more
touristic and valuable for the visitors (URL 2).
Conservation policy helps the marketing of the city.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Analysis of the Architectural
Heritage of the Walled City of
Famagusta

In 2008 and 2010, the Walled City of Famagusta
specifically the historic part was placed as a
monumental maritime, social and economic historic
part of the world. It drew the attention due to the
spanning centuries of architectural monuments of
the Mediterranean historic city (URL 2).

In the Walled City of Famagusta, there are existing
different architectural heritages belong to the
different historical periods. Some natural disasters
such as floods and earthquakes and also the effects
of time have caused damage to buildings. These
architectural heritages get conserved in different
periods in the history. Although some of the
architectural heritage buildings and monuments
have a rich history behind, still they are ruins. They
need a deep study on them and try to conserved
for keeping them as a cultural heritage of the city
for the next generations. Some of this architectural

heritage which is renovated lost their real function.
They transfer to stores, cafes, bars, and restaurants.
This issue makes the history part of the city livable.
This research is analyzing some of the walled city
architectural heritage buildings which keep their real
function and the ones that change their function.

St. Nicholas Cathedral

minaret added and all the interior walls were painted
in white colour.

city centre of Famagusta. Thus, it is not known enough
by the tourists. Martinengo Bastion was constructed
in the Venetian Period. In that period, Venetians
come to the point that the defence situation of the
northwest corner part of the Famagusta city is weak.
They built this part to strengthen the city for defence
situations. The conservation of this architectural
heritage site is finished in 2017 (URL 8).

Othello Tower
It is one of the most important citadels or tower in
the history of Mediterranean area specifically in
Famagusta city of Cyprus (Fig.6). Walking through
the gateway of the citadel with the lion of Venice after
a hundred years still has a sense of mystery inside.
The citadel is consisting of the different parts as wall
fortifications, connecting walls and also four towers.
Othello tower constructed in the eight towers but
in the years and through the history lost four of
them. This citadel is compromising of the two-part
inner and outer part. The outer part is Venetian
fortifications that the history of the background
of it goes to 1492 parallel to the Lusignan period.
This tower has a defensive key role of the Famagusta
city walls between the port and the sea area. The
renovation of this project is finished in 2015 and
now is open to the tourist to visit the history and
also the story of this tower. Othello Castle is known
as a symbol of the famous story behind in the name
of Desdemona by Shakespeare. Each year once

Famagusta walled city (Fig.8). It is an entrance from
the other part of the city. Also, this architectural
heritage site is a massive construction area in the
middle of the rocks that belongs to the different
periods in history. The construction period goes
back to Lusignans that the tower was constructed.
It is formed in different periods such as Lusignan,
Venetian, Ottoman, and British. This land gate
consists of bridges, passageways and fosses. It
is connected to the outside of the city through

Walls between Arsenal and Sea Gate
Wall of Famagusta was famous through North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe (Fig.9). This architectural
heritage element was constructed over many years in history. It is developed through centuries by changing
the kings to extend the city parallel to protect the city from the wars. The wall is constructed by rubble
masonry core and also sandstone ashlars that both of them are connected with plenty of mortars together
(URL 11).
They are the important military architectural elements in the history that became architectural heritage

Next, to this valuable architectural heritage, several cafes and bars stabilized in the architectural heritage
buildings which are getting renovated. These cafes and restaurants and bars are located in the city centre
next to the main square. These architectural heritage buildings get invested by the locals to preserve the old
city of Famagusta. These converted buildings are named Monk’s Inn café and Bar as one of the most popular
bars in this area, which is located in the side street in the south part of St. Nicholas Cathedral (Lala Mustafa

CONCLUSION
In the contemporary world, tourism is one of the significant factors for the marketing of cities. It helps to
conserve the cultural heritage, carry it for the future generations and also increase the economic conditions
of the locals. By improving the policies for city marketing, tourists play an important role. City marketing
can be beneficial for keeping the culture of the locals in a city from ancient till now. Through conservation
and renovation, they can protect their heritage. Improving the number of tourists in a city causes more
communication with the world. The Walled City of Famagusta as a world’s valuable cultural heritage site has
the potential to absorb too many tourists. From the past to present there are different periods in the history
that they try to conserve these heritage in the Walled City of Famagusta. Mainly, during the last ten years
Bicommunal Technical Committee with European Union tries to renovate and conserve the architectural
heritage in the Walled City of Famagusta. By reading too many numbers of comments on the Trip advisor
site about the Walled City of Famagusta, it is visible that there are too many tourists that enjoy from the
architectural heritage of Walled city of Famagusta. After these conservations and renovations, the number
of tourists increased to visit this valuable heritage. There are several shop, cafés, bars and restaurants that
opened in the renovated buildings in the Walled City of Famagusta. Mostly, the function of these renovated
buildings was different than the previous centuries. This issue causes an increase of income for local people
and increases the quality of the city condition, when the buildings are actively using.

ABSTRACT

T

he purpose of the study, to research the impact of website features on the levels of visiting a
destination website before deciding where to go for the persons who living in Turkey. For this
purpose, a survey consisting of 12 questions and 3 factors (ease of use, design, accessibility) have
been administered to 411 people via e-mail and face to face. In the study, convenience sampling and
snowball sampling have been used together. Because of the fact that the website visiting levels variables
are categorical and hierarchical, it has been preferred ordinal logistic regression in the study. At the end
of the study, statistical differences were obtained regarding easy viewability of the information on the
website, easy access to the website and the use of the website at any time of the day.
Keywords: Destination, Destination Preference, Destination Website, Website Visiting Level, Ordinal
Logistics Regression

INTRODUCTION
Internet services starting with a limited use in the 1980s by attempts of some universities in Turkey is
particularly opened to personal use as of the mid-1990s. The use of the internet has been steadily increasing
from the mid-1990s to the present. Internet that had quite a few numbers of users in Turkey at early on has
gained an increasing momentum since 2004. The graph below shows this increase very clearly.

Figure 1. The number of internet subscribers in Turkey by year
Reference: Turkish Statistical Institute (TSI)

In view of Turkey’s population being more than 83 million, having more than 73 million internet
subscribers in Turkey shows that the internet is very widely used. Internet usage is continued to increase
with the changes in information technologies. Therefore, as everywhere in the
01whole world, everything is
done using the internet from the most complicated tasks to daily transactions also in Turkey.
In Turkey where using internet is very high, internet usage is important also to the tourism sector and
web technologies indispensable. It is an inevitable fact that that domestic tourists living in Turkey benefit
from the internet while they deciding to visit a destination. For this reason, the intention of domestic
tourists to visit destinations can be increased thanks to the strength of destination websites. However, even
if all the features required in a website are fully provided, the level of destination website visiting may vary.

347

4th International Tourism Congress

Domestic or foreign tourists often obtain the
information about the destination which they want to
visit from platforms such as travel agencies’ websites,
travel blogs, social media accounts. However, it can
be said that the usage of the websites belonging to
destinations is quite low in Turkey. Despite of this
status, it can be expected that, domestic tourists
living in Turkey find the website which contained
directly information more reliable. Therefore, it
can be stated that it is very important developing
destination websites, determining the common
features and applying them jointly. Nevertheless, it
can be expected that the level of destination websites
visit will increase and the intention of visiting the
destination will be positively affected.
In this study, it is purposed that examine the
effect of website features on the visiting levels of
destination websites. As such, after first mentioning
similar studies, information about population and
sample of the study, data collection method and
analysis method are presented. Then, the findings
obtained from the analyzes were stated and the
results were evaluated with similar results in the
literature. In the last section, suggestions were made
in the light of the evaluations.

LITERATURE REVIEW
In the literature, it is possible to come across studies
on the evaluation of the websites of the destinations,
the effect of these websites on the visitors and the
submission of suggestions in this context. Some of
the studies on this area are summarized below.
Lu, Lu and Zhang (2002) have evaluated
the tourism websites in the Chinese tourism
industry from the perspective of tourism website
functionality, tourism website user and tourism
website provider and have made recommendations.
At the end of the study, they have showed that
most of the tourism website providers are generally
regional tourism destination organizations that
provide comprehensive local tourism information
and services. They have also found that the main
purpose of web users was to obtain information, but
there were problems due to slow internet access.
Yaylı and Bayram (2009) have aimed to evaluate
the adequacy of the official websites of the provincial
directorates of culture and tourism in the context of
the information and features which presented on
their websites, and at the same time, they aimed
to propose a web-based destination model. In the
study, they have stated that the official web sites of
provincial cultural and tourism directorates should
have had local information, easy access, contact
information of authorized persons and consumeroriented appearance features.

348

Romanazzi, Petruzzellis and Iannuzzi (2011)
have examined the use of the website of tourists
through primary and secondary data for Italy’s
Puglia region. They have concluded that the use
of the website increased the reputation of the
destination and that tourists’ choice of destination
was positively related to the attractiveness of the
website and certain characteristics of the website.
Çiçek, Pala and Özcan (2013) have examined
in the selection of destination whether or not
destination web sites are more effective than other
elements (published ads, close-environment views,
frequently visited destinations, positive/negative
thoughts about destinations, promotional activities
apart from the internet). As a result, they have
stated that in the choice of destination, examining
the website is more effective than other elements for
decision-making for destination.
Eryılmaz and Zengin (2013) have mentioned
the role of internet in destination marketing and
proposed a website model for the Eastern Marmara
Region. In their proposed model, they have stated
that there should be a web address in which the
expression Marmara destination is mentioned,
should be banner ads in website, should be listed in
search engines, website advertisements should be
made through social media, and should be included
information of public institutions.
Chung et al. (2015) have investigated the corelation between destination website qualities and
intention to use it continuous and the effect of
destination website qualities on the intention to visit
the destination. As a result of their analysis with the
method of partial least squares, they have stated that
there was a mutual relationship between destination
web site quality and intention of continuous use and
that the quality of the web site had a positive effect
on the intention to visit the destination.
Rodríguez-Molina, Frías-Jamilena ve CastanedaGarcía (2015) have analyzed that whether the effect
of the design of a tourist destination website, and the
effect of the tourist’s processing of information, on
the destination image that the tourist creates. They
have found that when emotional messages are used
on the website and the individual is not experience
overloaded, destination image is more positive.
Resino, Rodriguez and Jimenez (2016) have
aimed to determine whether the websites at
different Spanish regions improved the image
of consumers towards destinations, identifying
their main dimensions and analyzing its effect on
satisfaction and intentions of the future behavior of
potential visitors. As a result, they have stated that
the differences in the composition of the perceived
image could be determined according to the
destination and that the perceived different image
dimensions have a significant effect on satisfaction.

In their study, Foroudi et al. (2018) have aimed
to measure the impact of the destination website on
the destination image of customers/visitors/tourists.
In this study, they have addressed to determine
the main factors on destination websites and
place identity, to determine the main impacts on
destination image and to determine the main effects
on favorable destination image. They have concluded
that the positive approach of the visitors to the
website affected the destination image to the same
extent and that the intention to revisit or suggest it
increased at the same rate as the destination image.
Polat and Yazıt (2018) have aimed to determine
whether the destination web sites at the Marmara
Region have the basic features that should be
available on the destination web sites and whether
these features are used effectively. They have found
that many district destinations in the Marmara
Region do not have a web site, and the destinations
with a web site have some points that need
improvement on their web sites.
When the literature is examined, it is possible
to come across studies that the destination websites
have positive effects on the destination image.
However, it was not encountered the study about
the website visiting level on domestic tourists who
examined the website of destination that before
making a destination decision.

METHOD
In the study, it was examined that before domestic
tourists who living in Turkey deciding where to go,
effects of the destination websites features on the
websites visiting levels. In the literature, there are many
studies indicating that web site features are effective in
the destination decision of domestic / foreign tourists
(Romanazzi, Petruzzellis & Iannuzzi (2011); Çiçek,
Pala & Özcan (2013); Chung et al. (2015)). However,
any study may have been not found on how often
domestic / foreign tourists examine the websites of
destinations when making a destination decision. It was
emphasized that according to the level of examination
of the web sites of destinations how are evaluated
the features of these websites and how assessments
vary between websites visiting levels. Therefore, in
this study, it was tackled that while domestic tourists
making a destination decision, whether the effects of
website features on the website visiting levels.
For the purpose of the study, it was utilized
that the questionnaire used by Bayram & Şahbaz
(2015), Bayram & Şahbaz (2016), Bayram & Şahbaz
(2017) and Faiz (2018). In this study, it was based
on that since it is emphasized the features of all
destinations rather than the evaluation of the any
destination website, it is used the questionnaire

which developed by Bayram & Şahbaz (2015). This
questionnaire consists of two dimensions which
“before purchasing services” (ease of use, design,
accessibility) and “after purchasing services”. Since
there is no accommodation, booking, transportation
etc. in destinations websites, it is taken the dimension
of “after purchasing services” in this questionnaire.
The questions in the questionnaire were prepared
with a 5-point Likert Scale and scored from “strongly
disagree (1)” to “strongly agree (5)”.
Since domestic tourists are consider in the study,
population is comprised of people who living in
Turkey and who visiting the website while making
destination decision. Sampling methods were used
since it is not possible to reach the whole population.
Convenience sampling was used to the participants
who answered ‘Yes’ to the question which “Have
you ever visited at least one time the website
of destination that you have intent to go, when
making the destination decision?”. In accordance
with information received from the participants
who answered ‘Yes’ to the question asked, snowball
sampling method was used also via e-mail.
After determination of the sampling method,
the sample size which is could best represent the
population was calculated. Depend on whether the
population parameters are known or not, there are
different calculation methods for calculating the
sample size. The following general formula, which is
used in cases where the parameters of the population
are not known, was used.

A value of 0.5 in the formula indicates the
probability of making the right choice for the
sample. The expression Z1-(_  represents the
confidence interval and 0.05 is the margin of error.
It was accepted that the confidence interval is 95%
and margin of error is 5%, within the scope of the
study. As a result of the calculation, it was concluded
that there should be at least 385 participants. For
this reason, a total of 450 participants were surveyed
and 411 of them returned ready for analysis.
Since the purpose of the study was to determine
the effects of the destinations websites features on
the visiting level of the websites, it was decided to
apply the regression analysis.
Since the destination
01
websites which is dependent variable has a
categorical structure, logistic regression was applied
for analysis. Especially, ordinal logistic regression
which is a type of logistic regression was performed,
because of the hierarchy between the dependent
variable categories.

KMO and Bartlett’s test results show that whether the statements in the questionnaire are suitable for
factor analysis. In above table, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy value greater than
0.5 (.775) and Sig value less than 0.05 (.000) are indicate that the data are suitable for factor analysis. In
Table 2, “Factor” shows the factors in the original questionnaire, “Statement” shows the questions in the
questionnaire, the “Statement Code” shows coding that will make it easier to use in analysis and the “Factor
Loadings” shows the loadings of each statement. Accordingly, it can be interpreted that factor loads of all
statements are greater than 0.5, so all statements can be included in the related factors. The validity of the
questionnaire was obtained via explanatory factor analysis.
Ordinal logistic regression was applied for the purpose of the study. There are three points to be
considered in Ordinal Logistic Regression: (1) There should be hierarchy between the categories of the
dependent variable. (2) There shouldn’t be multicollinearity in ordinal logistic regression analysis as in
multiple regression. (3) The parameters of the dependent variable in the Ordinal logistic regression should
be parallel to each other (assumption of parallel lines). Due to the fact that there is a hierarchy (never,
sometimes, always) between the categories of the dependent variable (website visiting level) in the study,
the first assumption was fulfilled. For the test of whether there is multicollinearity, the variance inflation
factor (VIF) and eigenvalues were calculated. These calculations were performed with the help of syntax in
Figure 2 in SPSS 22. The results were obtained are summarized in Table 3.

Due to the results in Table 3, since the VIFs of all variables are less than 10, it can be indicated that there
is no multicollinearity. On the other hand, obtained the value of 18,273 (0.201 / 0.011 = 18,273) that the
maximum value of the eigenvalues (0.201) divide by the smallest eigenvalue (0.011) is less than 1000, it is
interpreted as no multicollinearity. Accordingly, it can be said that the second assumption was provided.
Finally, the assumption of parallel lines was tested and results were obtained as follows.

The hypothesis of assumption of parallel lines is “H0: Parameter estimates go through the same breakpoint”.
As a result of the analysis, H0 cannot be rejected, because the significance level value (Sig.) is greater than
0.05 (0.998>0.05). Thus, it can be said that all categories of the website visiting levels (as dependent variable)
are parallel to each other. In case, parameter estimations go through the same breakpoint, it can say that all
calculated parameters are equal in all categories of dependent variable.
After three assumptions of ordinal logistic regression were realized, ordinal logistic regression was
applied. First, it was performed goodness of fit test. The aim of the goodness of fit test is to determine
whether the data obtained is compatible with the analysis. For this reason, the hypothesis proposed for the
test is “H0:ćFNPEFMJTDPNQBUJCMFXJUIUIFEBUB”. The results of the tests performed for the goodness of fit
are given in Table 5.

Chi-square and deviation tests are the most commonly used tests in logistic regression for goodness of
fit tests. Accordingly, the significance levels of both tests are greater than 0.05 so it can say that the model
is compatible with the data. In other words, tested the H0 hypothesis cannot be rejected due to the fact that
significance levels are greater than 0.05 (0.108 and 0.527).

Assumptions were tested and realized for ordinal logistic regression. Then, the goodness of fit test was
conducted and it was concluded that the model was compatible with the data. Finally, the results of the

Note 1: The dependent variable is ‘web visiting level (WID)’. The value 1 in parenthesis means ‘never’ and the value 2 indicates ‘sometimes’.
Note 2: The explanations of the values at right hand of equality in the independent variables are the same as the explanations on the 5-point Likert
scale.
Note 3: Variables that Sig value less than 0.05 are shown in parameter estimations. In other words, variables that significant differences in the
categories are included in table.

It is possible to say that the variables whose significance level is less than 0.05 are contained significant
differences in the findings regarding the parameter estimates. Accordingly, it can say that there are
significant differences in statements which was coded as KK1, U1 and U2. Participants who strongly agree
to the statement of “The information on the website should be easy viewability (KK1)” while make their
destination decision are visited the destination website 11.6232 times more than those who strongly disagree
to this statement. Along with the easy viewing of the information on the website, during the domestic
tourists make a decision for destination, they increase that the visiting level of destination website. In the
study conducted by Lu, Lu and Zhang (2002), it was emphasized that the main purpose of the web users to
apply to the website in the selection of the destination was getting information, hence the information on
the website should have the ability to be easily displayed and to provide up-to-date information. Just like Lu,
Lu and Zhang (2002), Chung et al (2015) also have stated that the information on the destination website
increased the intention of tourists to use the website. In terms of potential domestic tourists who living in
Turkey, Polat & Yazıt (2018) have also reached the conclusion that there should be up-to-date information
on destination website. It can be said that this result obtained within the scope of the study coincides with
the results obtained from similar studies in the literature.
Participants who strongly agree to the statement of “The website should be easily accessible on popular
search engines (U1)” while make their destination decision are visited the destination website 0.0729
times more than those who strongly disagree to this statement and 0.2356 times more than those who
disagree to this statement. Accordingly, if the website of any destination is ranked first in the popular search
engines, it can be provided that the web site of that destination can be examined more frequently. As stated
by Romanazzi, Petruzzellis, and Iannuzzi (2011), web users not spend much time browsing destination
websites. Therefore, accessibility must be fully provided for destination websites. Yaylı and Bayram (2009)
stated that the websites should be easily accessible by looking at provincial directorates of culture and
tourism, while Eryılmaz and Zengin (2013) stated that listing the destination websites in the search engines
is one of the most important features for the destination websites. With the results obtained from these
studies, it is possible to say that if the destination websites are ranked higher in the popular search engines,
destination website can be examined more frequently.
Participants who strongly agree to the statement of “The website should be available to use at any time
(any day, any hour) (U2)” while make their destination decision are visited the
01destination website 0,3734
times more than those who strongly disagree to this statement and 0.4049 times more than those who
disagree to this statement. This result can be handled together with the result that should be listed in the
search engines. Given that web users spend few time for visiting destination websites, it can be expected
that both listing the destination websites in search engines and being available around the every time can
increase the level of visiting that website.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Tourism is an important source of income for Turkey. In particular, the active participation of domestic
tourists in tourism activities provide the mobilization of domestic markets. For this reason, it is very
important to implement applications that will increase the destination visits of domestic tourists. With
the increasing use of the internet day by day, the importance of websites is also increasing. When the
websites prepared for the destinations are designed to meet the information demands, domestic tourists
will examine these websites more frequently when making a destination decision.
The situation that most influences the destination websites visiting level of domestic tourists is related
to the easy access to the information on the destination web sites. When deciding on a destination visit,
the most important point is that the destination information should be accurate, understandable and easy.
Therefore, it is very important that destination websites are prepared by experts. Simple menus, fluent and
simple expressions are available for users who want to get information about destinations. Preparing the
website design in such a way that all information can be accessed in a few steps can positively affect the
level of visiting websites. Considering that domestic tourists spend very little time on searching websites
for destination decision, it can be said that these websites ranking on the tops in popular search engines
will increase their level of visiting. In this regard, it can be achieved advantages that ranking on the tops
in popular search engines by coming together with representatives of search engines in Turkey. It is also
important to keep the website up-to-date. During these updates, it may be effective to provide active viewing
of the website.
There are some limitations in the study. This study done in terms of domestic tourists; it can carry out on
foreign tourists’ destination websites visiting level in Turkey. In addition to this, it can be addressed the levels
of visiting destination websites for other countries. Changes in the level of visiting the relevant website after
the arrangements to be made can be examined. On the other hand, the scope of the study can be expanded by
considering the social media accounts of the destinations as well as the websites.

ABSTRACT

T

he concept urban tourism has been a focal point of some tourism papers especially within the
last 10 years and its popularity is ever-increasing. In scope, despite the fact that the boundaries
are not precise, it is still a theme that is under researched probably due to its intertwined nature.
However, it is not an elusive theme in that the concept itself hints details regarding the link between
tourism. As such, thanks to its tangled relation to tourism, some cities came to be called through a
use of adjective like “love, smart, slow, gastronomy, etc… (cities)”. In other words, each city under
consideration adopted a strategy in translating the urban qualities into tourism business. Along with
this, not surprisingly, came the question of sustainability into the agenda, which was also the case for
mass tourism. On account of the advanced transport means, cities have been on the rise more than ever
in the last 10 years with respect to tourism attractiveness and daily tours have become a prominent part
of weekend activities. On the other hand, in the context of Turkey, according to the law numbered 6326,
it is stipulated that all tours have to be accompanied by a licenced guide. Guiding in Turkey is a topic
of unending debate among the scholars of tourism in Turkey with reference to the ways through which
you can be a guide with a must licence. All the above mentioned points at hand, the main objective
of this paper is to evaluate the present situation of urban tourism from the sustainability perspective
and perform a conceptual analysis on extent to which the subject of sustainability is covered by the
programs, with suggestions for future directions.
Keywords: Urban Tourism, Sustainability, Tourist Guides, Tourist Guide Education, Turkey

INTRODUCTION
It is an undeniable fact that cities account for a great share in tourism activities and hence in the economic
impact on the economies of the countries involved (WTTC, 2017). European Commission defines urban
tourism as “the set of tourist resources or activities located in towns and cities and offered to visitors from
elsewhere” (2000, p. 21), with an emphasis on the dynamics of the cities that could appeal to tourists. Apart
from the attractiveness cities have to offer as destinations, there is another aspect rather than the pull factors
of the cities, which is competition. Along with the fierce competition on global scale to get more share from
the “tourism pie” cities compete with other potential competitors and put great effort to set themselves
apart in terms of the activities, services and image (Zukin, 2009).
As held by Adamo et al. (2018), recent decades have witness competition founded on the touristic
attractiveness of each individual city; however, as of 1980s, the competition changed direction from the
regular and natural offerings like location and natural beauties to symbols and the developed images. In this
way, rather than the tangible aspect of the cities, intangible and experiential aspects began to play a big part
in terms of rendering the image of the city and position in the competitive environment (Papadimitriou
et al.,2015). For the sake of creating the desired image in the eye of the tourists, cities have come to the
forefront through creativity as a means of setting different image and to have competitive edge.
In Turkish context, it will not be mistaken to assert that the number of cities taking their righteous role
in urban tourism is on the rise, especially within the last 5 years. What’s more, something specific to Turkey,
tour guiding business and tourism has to go hand in hand in terms of expanding the touristic services and
making the tourism business more profitable and sustainable. Within the set framework by tour guiding
356

professional law number 6326, released in 2012, it is
a must that organized tours offered by travel agencies
have to be performed by a licenced guide given by
an appropriate authority, which is TUREB (Union
of Tourist Guides’ Chamber) in Turkey. In other
words, illegal guiding or guiding without a licence is
a crime in Turkey. Presently, according to data given
by TUREB, there are about ten thousand licenced
tourist guides in Turkey. Given the increasing
popularity of urban tourism and the very formal
structure and indispensible role of tourist guides in
packed tours in Turkey, the main objective of this
paper is to evaluate the present situation of urban
tourism from the sustainability perspective and
perform a conceptual analysis on extent to which the
subject of sustainability is covered by tourist guiding
programs, with suggestions for future directions.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Sustainability
As its name suggests, the term sustainability is the
collective combination of efforts to make tourism
activities more sustainable, reaching to future
generations and so on. There will be no mention
of sustainability of tourism in this part but the
concept itself and what it implies. The terms and the
notion of sustainability became a topic of interest
on the global scale towards the late 1980s, as a
reaction against the rising mass-tourism all over the
world (Jamal, et al. 2013). As a formal definition,
sustainable tourism is defined as “the current and
future needs of tourists as well as the host community,
and at the same time takes into account the social,
economic, and environmental aspects” (UNEP,
p. 11-12 ). With the aim of preserving the social,
economic and environmental characteristics, an
uninterrupted course of controlling and observing
the tourism flow in a given destination or place of
interest and in the event that anything against the
sustainable frame, which are economic, social and
environmental, occurs, not only preventive but
corrective precautions and actions are taken so as to
convert the situation into a sustainable framework.
This in mind, the actions taken by the authorities
may not be sufficient on their own and for this reason
a helping hand by tourists or the demand-side could
be of immense use for the sake of sustainability.
With respect to the demand side, Lerario et al.
(2017) suggest that involving tourists in the process
of sustainability will lead to awareness and in this

way the outcome of good practices by tourists will
influence the position and the development of
a given destination in a positive manner thanks
to the collaboration of tourists, leading to more
sustainably conscious tourist in the first place.
Besides, sustainability is not a core concept revolving
around such terms as environment, society and
economy. These three core terms do not necessarily
possess the same outcome for all levels of tourism
activity although tourism is regarded as the major
motivating force of many local economies across the
globe. According to Saarinen (2014), sustainability
has lost its essence by focusing on particular
destinations, missing the essence for the global scale
through its focus on solely the local markets and its
economic impact. Furthermore, it is also alleged
that the roles of residents are overlooked (Moscardo,
2011). However, the roles of residents in taking and
enhancing a sustainable stance towards tourism
is as important as the tourism assets themselves,
for residents are the ones who have to go through
and deal with the impacts of tourism occurring in
many dimensions of the society residents live in.
For this reason, residents should be incorporated in
tourism planning in all the efforts of sustainability
(Moscardo and Murphy, 2014).
There have emerged some other concepts along
with sustainability, also considered as the subcategory of sustainability, such as “ecotourism”
and “responsible tourism”, both of which focus on
environmental awareness. In the words of Blangy
and Wood (1993), ecotourism is “responsible travel
to natural areas that conserves the environment
and sustains the well-being of local people” (p.
36). On the other hand, responsible tourism
decreases the negative impacts and increases the
positive impacts in terms of social, economic and
environmental perspectives through a balance
between consumption and production by all the
parties involved (Saarinen, 2014).

Urban Tourism
While sustainability is a term with fruitful outcome
when implemented as it should be, real life
practices do not often live up to what is expected
mainly because tourism
01has its roots in the course
of business life and it is, like many sectors, profitoriented, hence usually not paying attention to
the sustainable aspects. It is no surprise that the
dynamic interactive nature of cities eventually uses
up all the resources allocated at their disposal. The

357

4th International Tourism Congress

progress of urbanization is very much related to the
formation of megacities and it is projected that by
2030 more than half of the world population will
move to urban areas (UNDESA, 2011).
Lerario and Turi (2018) find urban tourism
difficult to define and consider the concept far
more complicated than “tourism performed in the
cities”. Urban tourism is defined and examined
within the perspective of multifunctional character,
microdestination, coexistence of built forms and
cultures, and peculiarities such as shortness of stays,
repetition of visits, and cities’ ability to recreate
themselves to satisfy the ever-changing wishes
of visitors (Asworth and Page, 2011; BarreraFernandez et al. 2016 ).

Tourist Guiding
A tourist guide, as its name suggests, is the one who
guides. While in ancient times they were regarded
as “pathfinder”, nowadays the complexity of the
roles of guides range from pathfinding, acting like a
compass, to culture brokers and educators. A formal
definition has been provided by The European
Committee for Standardisation (CEN, 2007),
according to which a tourist guide is “a person
who guides visitors in the language of their choice
and interprets the cultural and natural heritage
of an area, which person normally possesses an
area-specific qualification usually issued and/or
recognised by the appropriate authority” (p. 4). This
being the case, the roles attributed to tourist guides
much more than being simply complex. They are
informal ambassadors, educators, interpreters that
bond social, cultural historicalpillars for the visitors
in a manner that will not only educate but also lead
the groups. Thanks to interpretation, the tasks to
be performed by tourist guides go beyond mere
reciting names and facts. Otherwise, a smart phone
with the Internet access would make good guides.
Tourist guides are the tools to increase awareness
about the issues particular to the destination or to
global scale. Pertinent to sustainability, according
to Pereira and Mykletun (2017), “tourist guides
can interpret an attraction or phenomenon in
an informal manner and present salient issues
in sustainability, potentially provoking thought
while making meaning of places and situations.
The voice of tourist guides is an innovative tool for
transferring sustainable principles to inspire tourists
and potentially influence changes in behaviours
and attitudes” (p. 359). In other words, the role

358

of tourist guides is not only guiding about a place
itself but also “soft” issues related to the place under
consideration.
The units of United Nations have so far
highlighted that in order to reach sustainability
aims, education is an efficient tool (UNESCO, 1997;
UN, 2017). All the roads to become a tourist guide in
Turkey cannot be viable without a solid educational
background and practice training, which is offered
by either TUREB (Union of Tourist Guides’
Chamber) or Tertiary Education institutions.

Assessment of the Programs with
Specific Reference to Sustainability
and Discussion
The use of the term of sustainability in the sense
we know sates back to the 1987 “Brundtland
Report”, also referred to as “Our Common Future”.
According to the definition given in the report
sustainability is “development that meets the needs
of present generations without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own
needs” (WCED, 1987, p. 43).Taken from the point
of tourist guiding, sustainability holds an important
place in tourism to sustain it for posterior. This
being the case, spread of the notions and principles
of sustainability across the society is of paramount
importance to be implemented by professionals and
university graduates with this notion are what a
study needs (Kagawa, 2007).
As mentioned earlier, the three conventional
pillars of sustainability are economic, social and
environmental ones. These three elements make up
the main criteria in the analysis. The fundamental
reference to the courses given in tourist guiding
programs are set by TUREB According to the latest
regulations, presently in the certificate programs,
there are 16 courses, some of which are Sociology,
History of Anatolia Civilizations, General Tourism,
Turkish Folklore and Traditional Handicrafts,
History of Arts, Communications Skills and so on.
Interestingly, among the 16 courses mentioned, no
course related to sustainability has been found out.
Imagine there were courses related to sustainability,
could you transfer the notion of sustainability
though courses?
What’s more, presently, in Turkey there are 23
tourist guiding programs offering Associate’s degree
and 30 programs offering Bachelor’s degree and 9
programs offering Master’s degree (with non-thesis

options). Excluding the Master’s degree programs,
the total number of the two-year and four-year
programs is 53. Out of 53 programs, 10 from fouryear programs and 10 from two-year programs
were randomly chosen and their curricula have
been examined to see if the subject of sustainability
has been covered. Of the programs examined, there
is a mention of sustainability, usually dealt with
in General Tourism or Introduction to Tourism
courses. Plus, it is no surprise that “urban tourism”
has been covered with specific emphasis, despite
the fact that this was not the point of interest of
this paper.
Being a must part of all organized tours in Turkey,
the guides’ influence to support and spread the
notion of sustainability is an undeniable fact. While
performing their role of educators, the responsibility
they have on their shoulders is a lot more than mere
information-giver. Using their educator-function,
the contribution of tourist guides to sustainable
could be of immense opportunity and benefit.
Considered as the rising star of tourism types,
urban tourism is on the way to engulf the interest of
scholar and from the supplier side, it is a resource of
income for the locals and for those offering service
and amenities. The result of the examination of the
curricula suggest that under the present condition of
tourist guiding education, prospective tourist guides
are not ready to deal with the sustainability related
issues, let alone sustainability in urban tourism.
As for future studies, it is suggested that studies
covering all the curricula should be conducted and
a comparative study between Turkey and some
European countries would serve much better for the
sake of sustainability and urban tourism. Besides,
as much as the course-related subjects, the real life
practices could be another alternative rather than
sticking only to curricula or the list of courses. At
a further level, an interesting topic could revolve
around whether the notion of sustainability taught.

ABSTRACT

I

t will not be unjustified to assert that global developments in conjunction with local developments
in tourism field have at last led to a number of new perspectives in shaping the business flow of
tourism. Urban tourism, also known as city tourism, is undeniably one of the novel outcomes of
the new perspectives that emerged. The research into urban tourism had not had its righteous place in
tourism literature until the first half of the 1990s. Nonetheless, this emerging domain of this new type
of tourism has still been in its infancy compared to other tourism-related domains. Defined as “… set
of tourist resources or activities located in towns and cities offered to visitors elsewhere” (European
Commission, 2000, p. 21), Urban tourism is very much related to the dynamics embedded in cities and
the social, economic and cultural feature a city has to offer to visitors. From the demand side; that is,
from the point of tourists, the quality and the quantity of the tourism services offered, expanded and
differentiated tourism services and the extent to attract visitors can be said to make up the fundamental
of urban tourism dynamics. This being the case, the first objective of this paper is to analyze and outline
the concept of urban tourism in scope. The second objective is to examine the concept of urban tourism
in terms of its reflection on Turkish Tourism Academia through a bibliometrics analysis. In this context
16 research article obtained and analyzed. Results illustrated that researchers more tendency to use city
case study and qualitative research method in Turkey.

INTRODUCTION
For Turkey, tourism represents an opportunity of growth, economic and social development. With the
changes in social life, interest in alternative tourism types is increasing instead of tourist movements in
sea-sand-sun understanding. These changes have enabled the development of urban tourism, including
short-term visits to cities for many social, cultural and artistic purposes (Kaynak &Karabulut, 2016). In
fact, while urban tourism is one of the oldest tourism movements, with the development of the right to paid
leave, there has been a great shift from urban tourism to coastal, rural or mountain regions since the early
1980s. Therefore, it would be a more correct approach to treat it as a reemerging and rising form of tourism,
not as a new type of tourism (European Commission, 2000: 21).
In parallel with growing tourism industry over the past two decades in Turkey, the amount of academic
knowledge generation has also been increasing (Evren & Kozak, 2014).Because urban life and urban
attractiveness has become important again within tourism context in recent years, it has been quite
necessary to examine the development of urban tourism by the conceptual sense. Hall (2011) has
emphasized that bibliometric analysis is important for tourism literature as a result of external evaluation of
research quality, interest in impact and prestige factors, and study of the field’s development. Bibliometrics
is a field that uses mathematical and statistical techniques, from counting to01
calculus, to study publishing
and communication patterns in the distribution of information (Diodato, 2012).
In this context, the first objective of this paper is to analyze and outline the concept of urban tourism
and the second objective is to examine the concept of urban tourism in terms of its reflection on Turkish
Tourism Academia through a bibliometric analysis. Although bibliometric studies have been conducted by
some researchers (Palmer et al., 2005; Hall, 2011; Evren & Kozak, 2014; Ruhanen et al., 2015; Köseoğlu et
al., 2016; Güzeller & Çeliker, 2018 etc.) in various aspects of tourism, bibliometric study focused on urban

tourism has been seen insufficient when the relevant literature is examined. The present study is regarded
as significant owing to draw an overall picture of the research conducted in the field of urban tourism in
Turkey, it expected fill an important gap in the literature.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Urban tourism is basically a complex and difficult form of tourism to determine as a conceptual framework.
Despite the fact that urban tourism is a growing research area as researchers and policy makers seek to
understand the phenomenon of tourism within the urban environment (Edwards et al., 2008), the
phenomenon cannot be said to receive the attention it deserves. There have been some attempts to define
urban tourism in the literature. According to Wang and Pei (2014) urban tourism is a general term of
various urban tourism activities of outsiders and its related influences on society, economy and environment.
Lapko (2014) states that urban tourism consists of all the conditions and manifestations of tourist activity
occurring in this area, taking into account both the tourist attractiveness of urban space, which is one of the
main conditions for travelling, forms of tourism and tourist infrastructure (Lapko, 2014).
Urban tourism is a type of tourism generally carried out in metropolitan cities. When it comes to urban
tourism, all elements such as originality, modernity, security, technical equipment and infrastructure
services, facility quality and price policies, recreation services, urban outdoor area quality, which make
the city life attractive, should considered (Emekli, 2011).Urban tourism can be defined briefly as tourism
activities offered to visitors in towns and cities” (European Commission, 2000: 21).
The European Commission (2000) remarks that urban tourism depends on many factors such as the
size, history and heritage, morphology and environment, location and appearance of the city, but basically
includes activities such as (European Commission, 2000: 21-22):

In urban tourism context, tourists generally join in travels offering flexibility and diversity, range
of sports, cultural and social activities, recreation facilities, shopping opportunity and a few days of
accommodation. On the other hand, tourists traveling to cities for cultural purposes visit the exhibitions,
museums, monuments and historical sites in the cities (Şarkaya İçellioğlu, 2014: 42). Fairs and trade shows,
which are one of the main elements of urban tourism, play a supporting role in the economic and touristic
development of cities (Koçak & Karakaş Tandoğan, 2008). Arts festivals, likewise, culture-led urban
regeneration strategies and become a mainstay of urban tourism and urban policy-making (Quinn, 2013).

Figure 1. Sub-themes within the domain of urban tourism research (Ashworth and Page, 2011)

362

Ashworth and Page (2011) have divided the studies on urban tourism into 12 sub-themes: marketing/
place imagery, cultural agendas, impacts, sustainability, visitor perception and satisfaction, urban
regeneration, models, typologies of tourist cities, city case studies, social theory/theoretical, transport and
infrastructure (Fig.1).
The first research about urban tourism date back to 1980s (Uca Özer, 2010).These researches mainly
focused on urban tourism and its development on a national scale (Jansen-Verbeke, 1986; Buckley&Witt,
1989). When the studies conducted in the 1990s (Roche,1992; Murphy, 1992; Hinch, 1996; Bramwell, 1998;
Snaith & Haley, 1999) are examined, it is observed that the issues such as planning and marketing of urban
tourism resources and sustainability of urban tourism, satisfaction levels of urban tourists have begun to
be examined. From the 2000s onwards, researchers have focused on more specific issues in a similar line.
Suh and Gartner (2004) examined how tourist perceptions towards South Korea differ according to
their nationality and purpose of visit. They found that Japanese tourists coming for business gave more
importance to the security-centered and functional characteristics of tourism products than North
American and European tourists. Rogerson (2004) in his research has addressed the role of small enterprise
development in urban tourism. Richards (2011), Rogerson (2017) and Adamo et al. (2019) have stressed
that creativity is necessary for success of urban tourism destination. Miller et al. (2015) have shifted the
debate on sustainable tourism destinations from an emphasis on ecotourism and eco-resorts towards
sustainable urban tourism destinations, While Lerario and Turi (2018) have handled sustainably urban
tourism concept within the scope of building-related indicators.

METHODOLOGY
The aim of this study was to explore trends and patterns in urban tourism and to show the current state
of scientific researches regarding urban tourism in Turkey via bibliometric analysis. The articles that
constitute dataset was collected by searching for key words ‘urban tourism’ and ‘city tourism” from online
article databases (e.g. Ulakbim, Sobiad, Asos Index) and academic search engines (e.g. Google Scholar)
between June and August 2019.The titles of the articles were used in defining them as urban tourism related.
However, because the urban tourism concept is a new phenomenon and the framework of the studies on
the subject is not clearly, some articles could not be defined based on their titles. To define these articles as
urban tourism related, their abstracts and the key words were assessed.
Consequently 16 articles were specified that focused on urban tourism. Within the scope, regardless
of publication date, all the urban tourism related articles published in national refereed journals analyzed
in terms of several parameters such as their distribution research method, subject, publication date,
keywords, etc.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, the data set has been analyzed and result are illustrated via tables. The findings concerning
with evaluated article themes and results are presented in Table 1 according to publication date.

4th International Tourism Congress

As it seen in the Table 2, most of the studies
analyzed (43, 75%) have got more than 20 pages
and half of these researches has prepared by single
author (50, 00%). When the research methods of
the articles are examined, it is seen that qualitative
research methods have been used to a large
extent(68, 75%) in the studies, while only 5 articles
(31, 25%) has been prepared by using quantitative
methods.
As is also understood from the Table 2, urban
tourism researches have more focused to city case
study in Turkey (37, 50%). The other articles discuss
the subject with its marketing (6, 25%), theoretical
(6, 25%), recreational (12, 50%), cultural (12,
50%), visitor (12, 50%) and management (12, 50%)
dimension.
When the distribution of articles by years is
examined, it is seen that the most articles (25,00%)
were published in 2014. It is noteworthy that the
first publications based on urban tourism were
published in 2008.
While 56.25% of the articles included the
concept of urban tourism in the keywords, 31.25%
of the papers put the concept in the first rank.
43.75% of the articles did not include the concept of
urban tourism in their keywords.
On the other hand, a great majority of articles
(50, 00%) has seen published in the social sciences
journal. 18, 75% of articles have published in
tourism related journals.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The present bibliometric study aimed to provide
an overview of how urban tourism research has
evolved in the Turkish scientific community. As a
result of searches made without any date limitations,
16 articles focused on urban tourism in Turkish
literature were identified.
While the first international studies on city
tourism date back to the 1980s (Uca Özer, 2010),
the oldest urban tourism based article achieved in
Turkish literature belongs to 2008. This finding can
be interpreted as the fact that the Turkish academy

366

lags behind the world in recognizing the importance
of urban tourism. On the other hand, urban tourism
as a research topic can be considered as not got the
attention that it deserves still in Turkey. When the
current studies were examined, it was found that the
majority of the articles was single-authored and had
more than 20 pages.
In their research Evren & Kozak (2014) aimed to
reveal the general development of tourism literature
in Turkey, has found that most of the articles used
empirical methods, and the others were conceptual
assessments of tourism-related issues. Our findings
related research methods of the articles draw the
attention that qualitative method usage tendency
is more between Turkish researchers when urban
tourism is concerned.
Findings reveal that a substantial part of
research has been published in journals of social
science. Until the last five years lack of tourism
centric journal in Turkey, may conceivable as the
main cause of it. Tourism centric journal number in
Turkey has been increasing during the recent years.
Distribution of research subjects is another
interesting point of the study. Ashworth and Page
(2011) in their research that has examined recent
progress and current paradoxes in urban tourism,
have divided urban tourism related research
to 12 sub-themes. Accordingly, international
urban tourism researches consists of sub-themes;
marketing/place imagery, cultural agendas, impacts,
sustainability, visitor perception and satisfaction,
urban regeneration, models, typologies of tourist
cities, city case studies, social theory/theoretical,
transport and infrastructure. In the present study
result shows that in Turkey great majority of
urban tourism articles have focused on city case
studies. There is little research that examines the
marketing, theoretical perspective to urban tourism,
recreational dimension, cultural agendas, visitor
perception, and management. Within this scope
results are parallel with Ashworth and Page (2011).
Urban tourism related other sub-themes (planning,
economics, urban regeneration, typologies of
tourist cities, infrastructure etc.) is still pending
investigation in Turkey.

ABSTRACT

I

stanbul is the top leading city in Turkish tourism in terms of foreign tourist arrivals as reported by
Ministry of Culture and Tourism statistics. The Golden Horn (Haliç) plays an important role on
Istanbul’s tourism due to its historical, cultural and recreational sites. The Golden Horn Region was
the first settlement of Istanbul throughout history. Some historical and religious locations have made
this region especially important in terms of religion tourism. It’s a well-known fact that clean, unpolluted
environments attract tourists. Also, sustainable tourism needs clean environments. Deteriorations in
environmental conditions may result in loss of importance of tourism destinations. In short, it can
be said that tourism cannot exist without environment. The Golden Horn Estuary has been classified
as “Sensitive Water Zone” according to the Turkish Environmental Regulations. Therefore, increasing
water pollution may cause the Golden Horn to lose its tourism attractiveness. Because of extreme and
unplanned growth of Istanbul in the last century, the Golden Horn has served as receiving body for
wastewater discharges. In the beginning of 1980’s, water quality was so deteriorated that strange odor
makes impossible to stand near the Golden Horn. It was extremely polluted till late 1980s because
of wrong city planning, domestic and industrial wastewater discharges and solid wastes. Pollution
of this region was in the focus of both scientists and local authorities. In 1984, “The Golden Horn
Environmental Protection Project” has been carried out with great efforts to bring Golden Horn to its
magnificent days again. Industrial plants moved, waste water collection system and treatment plants have
been build. Moreover, bottom sediment of estuary has been removed in order to improve water quality.
Following the restoration period, the Golden Horn has become the center of cultural tourism after the
establishments of some places like Feshane, Rahmi Koç Museum, Miniatürk and Haliç Congress Center.
Also, shorelines of estuary has been arranged as green corridors for recreational purposes. Finally, the
Golden Horn and its surroundings were become a cultural, art, tourism and recreation valley.
The aim of this study is to explain the dependency of clean water environment for sustainable tourism.
This paper summaries the literature about The Golden Horn in terms of water quality and sustainable
tourism. The reasons of water pollution of the Golden Horn over years are summarized. After that,
environmental protection efforts and recovery of water quality and biodiversity have been discussed.
Then, the importance of the Golden Horn region in terms of tourism is emphasized. The importance
of environment for sustainable tourism is explained by the example of the Golden Horn’s water quality.

INTRODUCTION
Sustainable tourism activities depend on clean and unpolluted environments. It is a well-known fact that
clean environmental conditions attract tourist. Deteriorations in environmental conditions like water, soil
and air pollution may result in the loss of attractiveness for tourism destinations. In short, unpolluted
environmental conditions are necessary to sustain tourism activities. Sustainable tourism has been defined
by World Tourism Organization as “tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic,
social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, and the environment
and host communities” (Pulido-Fernández, Cárdenas-García, & Espinosa-Pulido, 2019). Environmental
sustainability is especially important for the continuation of tourism activities since polluted environments
01problematic in application
(air, water and soil pollution) results in discomfort of tourist. Although it is still
(Pulido-Fernández et al., 2019), environmental sustainability programs have been developing and
applying by tourism industry, tourists, local and regional governments to reduce the ecological footprint,
consumption levels and greenhouse gas emissions.
According to the tourism statistics published by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Istanbul is one
of the most important tourism cities in Turkey. In 2018, 39488401 foreign tourist have been visited Turkey.

369

4th International Tourism Congress

34.02% (13432990) of these tourist have entered
Turkey through Istanbul. Antalya, Edirne, Muğla
and Artvin are following Istanbul in terms of tourist
arrivals. Therefore, it can be concluded Istanbul is
an important tourism city in Turkey. The one of
most attractive tourism destination in Istanbul is the
Golden Horn (Haliç) estuary and its surrounding
area. In ecological science, estuaries are semienclosed and sensitive transition zones between
salty and fresh water (Kocak, Yetilmezsoy, Gonullu,
& Petek, 2010; Yüksek, Okuş, Yilmaz, AslanYilmaz, & Taş, 2006). According to the Turkish
Environmental Regulation (Sensitive and less
sensitive water areas communique concerning urban
waste water treatment regulation, Official Gazette
date: 27.06.2009, number: 27271), the Golden Horn
Estuary has been classified as “Sensitive Water Zone”,
that can go into eutrophication. Eutrophication is
the term used to describe water quality which is
polluted by organic pollutants, algal blooms exist on
water body, dissolved oxygen concentration is quite
low to support aquatic life and water body would
turn into swamp ultimately. Therefore, increasing
water pollution may cause the Golden Horn to lose
its tourism attractiveness. Consequently, tourism
revenue losses may occur.
The purpose of this interdisciplinary study is to
explain the dependency of clean water environment
for sustainable tourism. In this study, literature
related with water pollution and remediation of the
Golden Horn has been reviewed. The improvements
of tourism activities after the rehabilitation project
has been analyzed. The dependency of clean
environment for tourism and recreation facilities
have been discussed by the Golden Horn example.

THE GOLDEN HORN REGION
The Golden Horn estuary starts between Sarayburnu
and Galata regions and ends where Kağıthane and
Alibeyköy creeks reach to the sea. It covers 2.6 km2
area (Altunkaynak, Özger, & Çakmakci, 2005). The
width of the Golden Horn is 700 m. at wider part
and it becomes narrower at Eyüp region (Türkhan,
2008). Karaköy, Şişhane, Kasımpaşa, Hasköy,
Halıcıoğlu and Sütlüce stay at the northern part of
the estuary, on the other hand, Eminönü, Unkapanı,
Cibali, Fener, Balat, Ayvansaray, Defterdar, Eyüp
and Silahtar remain at the southern part (Onem
& Arslanlı, 2006). The Golden Horn is especially
important among Istanbul’s tourism destinations
due to its historical, cultural and recreational sites.
This region was the first settlement of Istanbul
throughout the history and the center of trade.
Geographical position makes perfect place for
harbor (Ozdemir & Gokmen, 2017). Some historical
370

and religious events have made this region especially
important in terms of religion tourism. Mosques are
located in Eyüp, churches are located in Fener and
synagogues are located in Balat.

WATER QUALITY OF THE
GOLDEN HORN
History of Water Pollution
Waters of the Golden Horn was quite clean in
primeval ages. During the Byzantine Empire,
alluvions carried by Kağıthane and Alibeyköy
Streams had caused anaerobic degradation and
Golden Horn had been called as “Saprathalassa”,
which means decayed sea (Türkhan, 2008). The
first environmental protection project in the
Golden Horn Estuary had been applied by Sultan
Mehmet “the Conqueror” (Yüksek et al., 2006).
In 18th and 19th centuries, there were three main
sources for water pollution in the Golden Horn:
alluvions carried by streams, solid wastes disposed
into the Golden Horn and wastewater discharges
coming from industrial facilities. At the beginning
of 20th century, due to the extreme and unplanned
immigration and urbanization of Istanbul, the
Golden Horn has served as receiving body for
domestic wastewater (van Leeuwen & Sjerps, 2016).
In 1936, the Golden Horn had been declared
as an industrial zone as a result of wrong city
planning prepared by the French urbanist Henry
Prost (Coleman, Kanat, & Aydinol Turkdogan,
2009; Ozdemir & Gokmen, 2017). Factories,
without wastewater treatment plants, continuously
and heavily polluted water for decades (Taş, Okuş,
& Aslan-Yilmaz, 2006; Tuncer, Tuncel, & Balkas,
2001). In 1985, there existed approximately 700
industrial facilities and more than 2000 commercial
facilities near the Golden Horn region (Altinbilek,
2006). It was extremely polluted till 1990s because of
domestic and industrial wastewater discharges and
solid wastes (Kocak et al., 2010). Strange hydrogen
sulfide odor from anoxic sediment was so excessive
that no one could stand near it (Coleman et al.,
2009).
Observing water quality parameters in the
Golden Horn can show how water has been polluted
for years. For example, biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) - a water quality parameter related with
wastewater discharges - measurements have shown
an increasing trend till restoration period. BOD
concentration was measured as less than 20 mg/L
before 1970, whereas, it was in the range of 20 –
70 mg/L which means water showed the diluted

wastewater characteristics (Coleman et al., 2009). In
1980’s, water quality was classified as the worst class
according to Water Protection Control Regulation,
which means that the Golden Horn’s water cannot
be used neither for drinking, recreational nor
industrial purposes. Trends were similar to BOD in
other water quality parameters. Dissolved oxygen
concentration, vital water quality parameter for
aquatic life, was less than required levels (<3.5
mg/L), therefore, all aquatic life were nearly distinct
(Coleman et al., 2009). Studies in literature have
stated that thousands tons of heavy metals (Cr, Cu,
Ni, Zn) have been discharged into the Golden Horn
since 1950 (Tuncer et al., 2001).

The Golden Horn Environmental
Protection Project
Many projects have been developed to protect
water quality of the estuary but none of them
have been applied till 1984. At last, “Golden Horn
Environmental Protection Project” has been
approved by Istanbul Greater Municipality and
Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration
(ISKI) to bring the Golden Horn to its magnificent
days again. With a total cost of US$ 653 million,
this project was one of the largest estuary cleaning
projects of the world (van Leeuwen & Sjerps, 2016).
Firstly, industrial facilities were moved outside the
region. Northern and Southern Sewerage systems
were furnished in northern and southern parts of the
Golden Horn to collect and transport wastewater to
wastewater treatment plants so that the wastewater
discharge to the estuary were blocked. Then, the
bottom sediment of Golden Horn was dragged.
5×106 m3 anoxic bottom sludge were removed form
estuary. Old Galata Bridge was removed from the
Golden Horn since floating bridges were blocking
water circulation (Altinbilek, 2006; Coleman et al.,
2009; Tas, 2015). Water quality and biodiversity of
Golden Horn Estuary was improved consequently
(Gönüllü et al., 2005). Following the sludge dredging
and bridge removal, Secchi Disc Depth value
(indicator of turbidity) increased, in other words,
water becomes less turbid (Coleman et al., 2009).
After rehabilitation project, water becomes clear and
nutrient concentrations were decreased. Dissolved
oxygen concentrations increased. Finally, water
quality was classified as swimmable (Coleman et
al., 2009; Yüksek et al., 2006). In 2002, Golden Horn
Environmental Protection Project has been awarded
by Metropolis Award as Winner (Altinbilek, 2006).

TOURISM AROUND THE
GOLDEN HORN REGION
The last step of the rehabilitation project was the
Golden Horn Cultural Valley Project (Coleman
et al., 2009; Gunay & Dokmeci, 2012). Following
the remediation project, the Golden Horn and
its surroundings were established as cultural,
art, tourism and recreation valley. The northern
and southern sides of estuary were arranged as
“green corridors”. Parks are constructed for the
urban beautification (Gunay & Dokmeci, 2012).
Miniaturk, where 1/25 scale of national and
international historical and architectural structures
exist, has been welcomed visitors since 2003. Some
of the industrial plants at the Golden Horn were
transformed to universities, museums or cultural
centers (Ozdemir & Gokmen, 2017; Uysal & Özden,
2012). For instance, old electricity generation plant
(Silahtarağa) was turned into Santralistanbul, an
international culture, art and education platform
(Düzgün & Aladağ, 2013). 43 different cultural
events have been exhibited since the establishment
of Santralistanbul. Main gallery building has been
awarded by “International Architecture Awards” in
2010 (https://www.santralistanbul.org/). Another
example is Kadir Has University which was establish
in the place of Cibali Tobacco Factory. Also,
Ottoman Navy anchor foundry and Shipyard have
been reorganized as Rahmi Koç Museum (Düzgün
& Aladağ, 2013). Similarly, old Textile Factory was
converted to Feshane Exibition Center. Furthermore,
Sütlüce Slaughterhouse was demolished for the
construction of Haliç Congress Center (Gunay &
Dokmeci, 2012). This building hosted 5th World
Water Forum between March 16 and 20, 2009 with
more than 25000 participants from 182 different
countries (http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/en/
istanbul-2009).
The Golden Horn has become the center
of cultural tourism after the establishments of
some places like Feshane, Rahmi Koç Museum,
Miniatürk and Haliç Congress Center. Moreover,
some important national and international sport
organizations have been performed in estuary or
surrounding region after the improvement of water
quality in the Golden Horn. Red Bull Air Race
World Series (29 July 2006 and 2 June 2007), Golden
Horn Half Marathon (20 April 2014), Isiklar World
01 (5 May 2012) Dragon
Offshore 225 Championship
Festival and Golden Horn Sailing Races are the
examples of these sport organizations held at the
Golden Horn. Also, recreational boat ride activities
became possible after the launch of Sultan Boats.

Most of above listed cultural places and sport activities were conducted after the rehabilitation period
of estuary. On the other hand, tourism activities are not limited by these list. The Golden Horn and its
surrounding region was the first settlement area. Because of some historical and religious events, faith
tourism is very important for the Golden Horn and its surroundings. This region is a meeting point of
the three celestial religions. Mosques are located in Eyüp, churches are located in Fener and synagogues
are located in Balat. Pierre Loti Hill, Eyüp Sultan Mosque, Bulgarian St Stephen Church and The Greek
Orthodox Patriarchy in Fener are some of the must see touristic destinations of the Golden Horn. Figure 1
shows the important locations around the Golden Horn.

CONCLUSION
Historical and natural beauties of Istanbul makes her the most attractive tourism destination in Turkey.
The Golden Horn estuary and waterfront region has lots of places to visit. Pierre Loti Hill, Eyüp Sultan
Mosque, Bulgarian St Stephen Church and The Greek Orthodox Patriarchy in Fener are the examples
of best destinations in Haliç region. Although estuary was severely polluted till 1990’s, the rehabilitation
project was applied with great efforts. The final step of restoration of the Golden Horn was the creation of
social and cultural transformation of waterfront area. After the transformation projects, estuary has gained
a new identity as cultural valley. Old factories and industrial plants were re-organized as cultural centers,
museums and universities. Most of these places were located on shoreline. Therefore, water quality strongly
affects the tourism activities because no one wants to visit a polluted places. By the rehabilitation project,
environmental sustainability has been achieved. Furthermore, by the creation of cultural valley, social
sustainability has been developed. With the increasing tourist attraction, economic development has also
been achieved. Therefore, all of the three pillars of sustainability are formed. In conclusion, it can be said
that the restoration and reorganization of the Golden Horn is a perfect example for sustainable tourism.

INTRODUCTION
Who want to continue using the assets you need every business today must use the opportunities of
marketing methods? Marketing from past to present; conditions have changed due to the development of
technology and many different variables. New concepts have been added to the marketing in today’s world
where the demands and needs of the consumer are not taken into consideration, and people-oriented,
demand and advertising and sales gain importance only from the period when production is based. One
of these is the Electronic Word of Mouth (EWOM). E-WOM; Potential, positive or negative statements
made by real or former customers about a product or company that is presented to many individuals and
institutions via the Internet (Hennig-Thurau ve ark., 2004, sf. 39).
The information on the Internet is usually provided through the websites of companies prepared by
marketers. The basis of this system is that people in social media share their opinions with others by creating
media content as photographs, videos or text. Blogs, discussion forums, shopping sites and social media
websites are different types of e-WOM platforms.
Instagram, one of the most used and highly interactive social media platforms in recent years, is one of
the e-WOM tools. Users have the ability to announce their likes, comments and shares to large audiences by
labeling the brands, people and institutions they want in this platform where they share their photos. The
opportunities to reach these broad masses have become remarkable in the field of marketing. Influencer is
called people, individuals and groups who have the power to influence and direct certain communities by
sharing their experiences and comments on the products and services they receive through the social media
channel they own. Most Brands do not engage in large advertising campaigns with famous people. They
374

prefer influencers. Influencers, who will display their natural environment by adapting their brands to their
daily lives, are more effective in influencing the target audiences.
The aim of this study is to understand the reasons, working methods of hotel businesses operating in the
field of tourism with Influencers and how effective these works are in promoting hotels.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
When we look at the concept of social media marketing, it means a process that will contribute to the
products, services and web pages of businesses online to a wide audience that cannot be reached with the
traditional advertisements of the media (Erçiş ve Yıldız, 2017). Companies use social networking platforms
to become recognized online and to hold on to their products (Yücel ve Kızkapan, 2016). All these activities
and objectives encourage companies to use different marketing ways.
Influencer Marketing is a kind of electronic word of mouth marketing (E-wom) and one of the new
generation marketing methods used extensively in social networks. This marketing method can influence
an audience by introducing and marketing methods on social media.
The basis of the electronic marketing activities is the monitoring of the experience of the influncers
through social media by those intending to purchase. People want to know what kind of emotion, satisfaction
and effect the product and service will buy. In today’s world which the services and products offered are
similar, the quality and the diversity of the experience gained by the person gain importance. The concept
of experiential marketing has been put forward by Pine and Gilmore (1998) within the scope of experience
economics studies and they have stated that they buy activities belonging to this product along with the
service they receive. At this stage, influencers staging their experiences through social media are important
mediators of experiential marketing.

Figure 1. Digital Around The World in 2019

Figure 1 shows the figures reached by social media as of 2019. 7,676 billion, of which 4.388 billion while
the world’s population of Internet users utilize social media as their 3,484 billion in assets. All of these
figures show a striking number in order to predict the audience that can be reached through marketing
activities on social media.
All these people who use social media extensively can use various digital platforms such as Facebook,
Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and LinkedIn. All these social platforms support brands in various ways in
advertising, promotion and image works. Instagram, which is one of the active platforms in Influencer
01using this platform is 290
Marketing area, has close to 895 million users and the total number of users
million, with age ranges between 25-34 (Figure 2).

Expenditures of social media users (Figure 3) show the highest figure in fashion and cosmetics with 525
billion dollars. When we look at the ranking in which expenditures are concentrated, we see areas such as
electronics, food and furniture. Accommodation spending is on this list with $ 750 million. Considering the
expenses made by users over the internet, it becomes necessary to reach the relevant audience via social media.

Influencer marketing is one of the most popular marketing methods in terms of brand recognition
and access to brands. Brands that are unable to follow the trend in social networks cannot address the new
generation but cannot make progress in recognition and image. Therefore, one of the main objectives of
businesses should be to exist in social media. Brands that fail to meet this requirement will fail to achieve
their desired goals.
In their study, Nathaniel J. (2017) examined the effect of Instagram’s explanation language (“SP”,
“Sponsored” and “Paid Ads”) based on advertising, brand attitude, intention to purchase and advertising
for sharing. According to the results of the previous researches, “Paid Advertising” announcements affect
the participants’ memory and the language of the disclosure affects the attitude and sharing of the brand
and has effective advertising features.
Ewers (2017) conducted research that provided information on marketing, an impressive element on
Instagram. In this research he reached the following conclusions; that marketers can help sponsor sponsored
Instagram posts to select an appropriate market, while the idea is that the shares on Instagram are very
effective, as well as the search for additional features that determine how effective they are to persuade in
marketing.

376

Chatzigeorgiou (2017) stated that the easiest
way to reach the younger generation in 2000s is
through social media accounts. In this study, it is
emphasized that rural enterprises should use the
personal relationships they have developed with
their customers and expand these relations in social
media. It is clear that traditional marketing cannot
be implemented in small rural enterprises, whereas
Influencer marketing is a valuable method for
tourism.
When the studies are examined, it is seen that
marketing activities made via social media platforms,
especially Influencer works, are highly effective
and affect the consumer significantly. Although
the use of social media has become widespread in
recent years, published studies are insufficient to
explain this area. The studies have tried to explain
social media, Influencers and their effect to buying
behaviors in general.

METHOD
In terms of the structure of the sector, the usage
areas of social media in the tourism sector are
spreading to a very wide ground. It has become
evident that the prominent way to reach out to
tourists is via Instagram accounts. It is also apparent
that traditional marketing fails to apply to city
hotels, whereas influencer marketing becomes an
asset for tourism. The proposed model connects
fame, image and activities with the Instagram
influencer and the way the decision making of the
tourists are influenced when choosing to stay at a
hotel. CVK Park Bosphorus Hotel, a 5-star hotel
operating in Istanbul, has been identified as the
working universe based on this study. The hotel is
actively using the Influencer marketing method.
The aim of the study is to understand and assess
how the hotels work with the influencers. The
Influencers worked on Instagram between the dates
of 04.01.2018- 27.04.2019 in the five-star hotel
examined in the research. Merve Alişan, the Public
Relations Manager of the hotel, runs this process.
15 questions about this process were asked to the
hotel public relations manager. She was interviewed
beforehand and informed about the purpose of the
study, why it was done, questions were sent by e-mail
and feedback was received by the same method. The
data obtained from the interviews were analyzed
with descriptive analysis technique.
Questions and answers of the interview are as
follows;

1. Which customer market is your hotel
addressing?
Our hotel appeals to the A ++ target audience
from various continents from Middle East to Europe.

an industry that can be introduced with experience.
3. What criteria do you take into account when
choosing Influencer?
We attach importance to the audience, the
quality of sharing, the number of followers, the
brands he worked with and the quality of the brand
and the influencer.
4. How do you get feedback on the influencers
you are working with?
Thanks to the influencers we work with, we
increase the number of our followers and increase
the likes of our shares. There is also an increase in
booking requests regarding hotel accommodation
and outlets via social media.
5. How do you analyze your feedback after
working with influencers?
The measurements are followed by our social
media agency. After starting to work, we can
measure with increasing interactions depending on
the number of followers and tastes changing.

from your work with Influencer?
We certainly think.
8. Which of the influencers you have worked
with has been more effective in promoting
your hotel? Why is that?

10. What is your Influencer Marketing budget?
Depending on the economic conjuncture
throughout the country and the projects developed
on a yearly basis, it varies.
11. Is there a specific order of working periods
with influencers?
No period is specified. Depending on the
projects developed, we do this to support the project.
12. What are your principles of working with
influencers?
We offer our guests the same way as Influencers
staying in our hotel. Unreal service or product is
not shared within the hotel. The target audience
of the hotel and the audience of Influencer should
be an overlapping audience. It is among our basic
principles that we prefer not to work with different
hotels while working with us.
13. How does your process of working with
influencers work? (Story sharing? Photo
sharing?)
The Influencer shares his experience as a post and
story with content to interact with during his stay.
14. How do you contact Influencer? How do you
get a return from them?
They mostly communicate via their social media
accounts.
15. What are the advantages and disadvantages
of working with influencers?
As an advantage, we can say that they do not
create operational problems because they share
their accommodation experiences and they enable
us to reach the desired audience easily through
their social media accounts. The disadvantage is
that they cannot be made in accordance with an
agreement since they are experiencing and that they
spontaneously share their experiences during their
stay from their accounts.

When the profiles of influencers are
examined, it is observed that all of them
have gained recognition with the use of
social media, and they have cooperated
with brands by interacting with the shares
they have made in their profiles. It is seen
that the lowest number of followers of the
hotel’s influencers is 10,700 and the
highest number of followers is 20 million
400 thousand.
Influencers are sharing photos and
stories to promote the hotel according to
their agreement with the hotel. These shares
are planned to increase their interaction by
reposting in the hotel profile (Picture 1).

There are not many publications and researches in the field of influencer marketing so this provides
a wide working area for researchers. In addition, although the studies are generally oriented towards
marketing, there is almost no work done in the field of tourism. Many studies can be done on the effects of
Influencer marketing, working methods and factors affecting tourism.

ABSTRACT

T

he purpose of this study is to review studies published in SSCI journal, Tourism Economics which
subjected Turkey in the context of sampling. In that sense, the condition of studies which subjected
Turkey is considered highly important for further researches. For this purpose, bibliometric analysis
approach carried out by reviewing a total of 55 publications under the eight parameters as publication year,
number of authors, pages, and citations, destination (i.e national, international), publication type, and
research approach. Results revealed that international studies were prominent, studies are increased in
years, in articles are more prominent and finally, all researches are carried out empirically.
Key Words: Tourism Economics, Turkey, Bibliometric Analysis

INTRODUCTION
Turkey plays a critical role in terms of tourism industry in addition to its varied and wealthy potential
in supply and demand. Increase was driven by a strong demand in Turkey’s tourism in last two decades,
demonstrated by Turkish Statistical Institute that the number of tourist arrivals reached around from
9 to 39 million. Cultural and social attractiveness of Country is assessed as an economic asset through
tourism. One of the most crucial aspects of tourism for countries is the income in which generated by
tourist expenses. Crucial amount of resources are transferred from developed economies to less developed
one through tourism.
In 1960s beside the beginning the rise of tourism in Turkey, scientific studies related to tourism also
began to increase. Scientific studies in both national and international literature that situated Turkey as a
destination are important in terms of tourism industry in Turkey. In this context, quantitatively analytical
approach to the studies toward to tourism Turkey considered highly crucial to shed light on Turkey’s current
stand in tourism industry.
Scientific studies published in Tourism Economics which is an international refereed journal
predominantly focuses on components of tourism services and micro and macro level economic
organization of tourism. Tourism Economics is also a journal that categorized in SSCI in which qualified
studies published in the field of tourism. A total of 55 published studies reached subjected to Turkey as a
destination in this very journal since its beginning to publish from 1994 to current.
By reviewing studies have published in Tourism Economics Journal subjected Turkey in tourism field,
the purpose of this study is to analyze those studies in bibliometric context and constitute a source for
researchers who are willing to conduct a research in this field. For this purpose, first of all, the literature
reviewed then the data related to bibliometric analysis are presented, finally the results of the study evaluated
and in conclusion, various suggestions proposed.

LITERATURE REVIEW

01

Uniqueness is crucial for scientific research and in order to produce unique research it is important to
review and evaluate the studies previously performed in that related subject. Bibliometric researches are
analysis the feature of studies in; research subject, journal, publication year, citations, number of pages, etc.
both quantitative and qualitatively (Al ve Tonta, 2004). In addition, such research approaches are by shed
lights on a relevant subject, discipline, journal, etc leads to researchers in the context of their direction to a

subject. Cole and Eales (1917) have performed the first bibliometric study by reviewing studies published
in anatomy literature in statistically.
Particularly in the 1980s, bibliometric studies technique was frequently used in various disciplines
and research field (Lawani, 1981; Ağaoğlu, 1985; Potter, 1988; Hoffman ve Holbrook, 1993; Kozak, 2000).
Continuously increase in the number of tourism studies the qualification of literature and articles, impact
factor and development processes of the literature evolved bibliometrics as an important research approach
(Hall, 2011).
A study examined the academic literature of tourism in Turkey concluded the improvement in primary
and secondary sources demonstrated the influential role of institutions, individuals and organizations in the
formation of literature. As a result, the study determined that in the field of tourism in Turkey a wide range
of quantitative research have performed, besides, these improvements in both quantitative and qualitative
research approaches are better far beyond than much of the countries around the world (Kozak, 2000).
Leung and Law (2007) reviewed 4140 researches based on information technology in tourism published
in six different journals betweem 1986-2005. As a result, the authors determined that researches increased
prominently between 1986 and 2005 on the other hand, they have found that these studies conducted by
different researchers from different countries, in addition to these researches conducted by more than one
author, authors found significant differences between those authors title and authors as well.
Huang and Hsu (2008) performed a bibliometric study towards to studies published in Tourism and
Tribune Journal between 2000-2005 for the purpose of determining the research subject conducted on
tourism and accommodation field. Results show that tourism resources development and management,
tourism planning, the problems of the tourism industry are predominantly used subject is studies. In
these studies, it was concluded that the qualitative research approaches were predominantly used while in
quantitative approaches statistical analyses were loose.
Ma and Law (2009) have reviewed 1034 studies published in Annals of Tourism Research Journal with
an interdisciplinary approach in terms of competency of tourism research in various parameters. Authors
determined that most of researches published in this journal in tourism subjected were classified under
20 category as social and cultural issues, tourism and economics, psychology and tourist behavior issues,
destination planning and development, heritage and environment issues.
In a scientific research examining the bibliometric profile of studies in tourism marketing field, Ozel
and Kozak (2012) focused on analysis of tourism marketing overall features. A total of 286 national studies
published in tourism marketing field were examined in terms of following parameters; years, number of
researchers, subfield of studies, distribution to resources type, most cited journals, authors, and institutions.
Results showed that most researches were published predominantly in 2010, while they were conducted
by two authors, on the other hand, in terms of type of resources most of the researches were published as
books, finally, the most cited journal were Tourism Management.
In this present study, a concise historical background of bibliometric studies were mentioned and
researches that related to bibliometric studies were summarised. However, during the literature review, it
was figured out that studies subjected to Turkey remain lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this very study is
to apply bibliometric analyze the international studies subjected to Turkey.

METHOD
Bibliometric studies which have published in a scientific field are important in terms of both highlighting
some features and giving some cues for scientific communication as; subject, year, institution that
contributed, keywords, number of authors, citations, joint citations (Ulu ve Akdağ, 2015). These researches
provide knowledge to researchers in a related subject besides presents information about development of
scientific researches or its current status. Bibliometric data are used frequently in providing information
about countries, universities, research institutes, journals, specific discipline, and subject (Huang, Ho ve
Chuang, 2006: 75-76).
The purpose of this study is to examine bibliometric features of studies published in Tourism Economics
Journal which subjected Turkey and present information to researchers who are interested in related topic.
In addition, this study also aims to demonstrate academic literature improvement of Turkey’s tourism. In
that sense, the sample of this study is Tourism Economics Journal publishing academic researches since
1995. In this context, bibliometric analysis approach carried out by reviewing a total of 55 publications

382

under the eight parameters as publication year, number of authors, pages, and citations, destination (i.e
national, international), publication type, and research approach.
This current study is considered crucial in both demonstrating the status of the studies subjected to
Turkey and the qualification of the studies published in Tourism Economics Journal. The scientific studies
published in Tourism Economics Journal evaluated in abstract, title and keyword context that contains the
concept “Turkey” together acquired entire years published in the journal. In that sense, relevant journal
has reviewed between August 01-05, 2019 in the context of aforementioned parameters and a total of 55
researches have reached, these researches constitutes of the sample of this study.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
In this study in order to examine studies subjected Turkey a total of 55 researches have reached that
published in Tourism Economic Journal. By using some determined parameters, bibliometric analysis
applied to scientific researches that subjected to Turkey. In that sense, it was aimed to enlighten the status
of the studies that subjected to Turkey and present information to the researchers. In order to perform
bibliometric analysis approach eight parameters were determined for these 55 publications; publication
year, number of authors, pages, and citations, destination (i.e national, international), publication type, and
research approach. In the first stage of the analysis, the acquired studies were examined in accordance with
one of each parameter and tabulated. Findings were presented below in accordance to the parameters.

Publication Year
The publication year of studies examined in Tourism Economic Journal contains 1999-2019. Tablo 1. shows
that there are no studies published for the year of 2001, 2004 and 2008 while there are studies that contain
Turkey as a sample from 2009 to current. On the other hand in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2018 with
only one study carried out it was determined that these years are the least years in which studies conducted,
while most studies conducted respectively in the years of; 2013 (nine studies), 2012 (seven studies) finally
2019 (six studies).

Number of Author
As shown in Figure 1. single authored researches were 23,6% while 36,4% of them were two authors. It
was also determined the number of authors in proportionately respectively 20% of researches with three,
4,5% of four, finally 5,5% of the researches were conducted with five authors. This result demonstrates that
researchers prefer to conduct their studies in this field by either by themself or with a colleague. Even though
researchers, in general, prefer to study individually, tourism studies as a matter of fact its interdisciplinary
aspect facilitates and frequently conducted researches with either two and more authors.

Figure 1. Number of Author

Number of Pages
As shown in Figure 2. the number of pages of study consists of with at least five pages while most were 37
pages. The number of 10 studies page that published in the journal consists of 5 to 10 on the other hand 32
of them were 11-16 pages. Since most of the researches were empirical, the tables and figures were thought
to increased the number of pages in studies. On the other hand, this parameter may also be the result of the
publication principles of the journal as well.

Number of References
Figure 3 demonstrates the number of references searchers have benefited in their studies. As shown in
Figure 3 while the least number of references that researchers have benefited were 5, the most were 117.
The majority of 55 studies (27,3%) were benefited from 16 to 26 references while 60 and more references
occurred rather common (23.6%). The number of references is highly related issue to limitation of the
sources, accessibility and rigorous of the researchers. It was concluded that in studies conducted towards
Turkey, the studies benefited references mostly between 16 to 26.

Figure 3. Number of References

Number of Citations
The number of citation of a study provides information about both its feature and place in the field. Based
on the analysis the number of citations of studies have differed from 0 to 370. The majority of citations in
the studies (47%) were between 0 and 15 times. As shown in Figure 4. the number of citation of the 26
studies of which constitute almost 50% of the studies examined were between 0 and 15. Given the citation
values of the overall 55 studies’, it was determined that six studies received no citation while the rest of the
six were published currently in 2019. The number of citation is highly related to the accessibility and degree
of interest that the relevant topic receives in the field o that study.

The majority of these 55 evaluated studies (78%)
sampled Turkey in an international context while
the remaining of the studies (22%) dealt national
only. It is plausible to select Turkey as a sample of
international tourism studies due to Turkey is a
tourism country. Therefore, Turkey placed in these
international studies as field of research.

in journal of Tourism Economics have high standards,
it is rather plausible that most of the works were articles.

Research Approach
Research approaches provide pre-knowledge toward
of qualification of studies. In general, research
approaches divided in two categories; amprical and
teorical. All total of 55 studies which are examined
in the scope of this study were empirical. Given the
overall profile of tourism studies as Turkey have
selected as a field of research, empirical approach
was frequently preferred (see Table 3). Considering
the theoretical framework of these studies were in
predominantly such as business and economics
sciences, it is not surprising that empirical approach
was applied in studies. However, in addition to
positivist, theoretical research approach and
reviewing case studies and analytical comparisons
among countries based on these studies may
contribute to widening the literature in this field.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
Bibliometric studies are considered important in
the context of better understanding of publications,
leading the authors in the field of related topics
and demonstrating the gap in a specific field of
research. This study aims to analyze quantitative
status of studies published in the Journal of Tourism
Economics that Turkey’s have selected by authors
as a sample of study. In this context, for the study,
bibliometric analyse was applied to a total of 55
scientific publications under the eight parameters as
destination (i.e national, international), publication
type, and research approach.
It was concluded that studies were mostly
international which Turkey was chosen as case and
studies were increased in recent years. On the other
hand in the research approach context, studies which
are published were more of articles while all of the
researches were empirically based on the analyses. The
studies were conducted with mostly two authors and
the number of page of these studies were predominantly
between 11-16 while authors benefitted from 16-26
sources and finally it was determined that most of the
studies received 0-15 citations.
As a conclusion of this study, one may conclude
that the number of studies related to Turkey is
limited. It is a known fact that European countries
allocate a significant amount of resources for
scientific researches. In Turkey also, particularly
as a matter of fact by using university funds the
authors can be encouraged to produce publications.
There are gaps in literature need to be filled in both
theoretical and case studies context that Turkey was
chosen as field of research. Given considered in
publication types context, articles were considered
the most favored and evaluated as accessible
and have more potential to receive citations. For
tourism researchers, one may conclude that in
addition to empirical studies, analytical theoretical
reviews thought to be convenient fields of research
for international literature. Because of the time
limitation, this study includes studies published
only in journal of Tourism Economics. Tourism
Economics journal is an SSCI journal, therefore, it
is thought to be more convenient in this study to
examine the studies published in which contain the
same standards. By including some other journals,
conducting further researches in this field, perhaps
will enable more comprehensive results.

region. From this point of view, the views of local people and visitors about the tourism potential of
Altınköy, which is a rural tourism area, were intended to be measured. The study was conducted in
Altınköy located in Altındağ, Ankara, which is considered to be one of the potential rural tourism areas
in Turkey, between August 2018 and October 2018 via face-to-face interview, a qualitative interview
technique, with 103 individuals in total 53 visitors and 50 working staff- who were selected through
random sampling method. The findings obtained as a result of the analyses point out significant results
regarding the contribution to the development of rural tourism in the region, promotion of the region
and its becoming a brand.

INTRODUCTION
Rural tourism as a tourism type is dependent on natural resources, besides having positive connotations
with rural settlements. Rural tourism embraces natural attraction elements and rural areas such as villages,
farms, adventure and sport venues (Situmorang et al., 2019: 20). Since it shines out the attractiveness of
adventure and sport venues which are part of recreational areas, rural tourism is considered as a component
of recreation, as well. Ecotourism, rural tourism, soft tourism, alternative tourism and many other similar
tourism terms describe recreational tourism activities organized in environmental-rural areas (Komppula,
2014: 361; Cucari Wankowicz and De Falco, 2019; 105). Thanks to the advantages it brings along, rural
tourism rises in its importance day by day among other alternative tourism types in Turkey. While
contributing to the development of the tourism economy in the country, it promotes, in the context of
destinations, the existing tourism mobility by introducing such elements as promotion, attractiveness and
development of the region.
One of the regions tending towards development in rural tourism is Altınköy, which has put into
practice a different touristic activity plan by offering visitors with the village life of 100 years ago, and thus,
be flooded by visitors every year. Located in Altındağ district of Ankara, Turkey, Altınköy reflects the village
life in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and thus, not only provides visitors with memorable experiences but also
paves the way for them to enjoy their free time. Due to various resources of high value such as the way of
preserving customs and traditions and historical and cultural characteristics it embodies, the preferability
of Altınköy among different tourism destinations increases day by day. Accordingly, the purpose of the

value sources of Altınköy, to ensure the transfer of
natural and cultural heritage to next generations
and to contribute to further development of rural
tourism in Altınköy.
In the context of the current study, the research
question determined by the researchers are as
follows: From the visitors’ and working staff ’s point
of view, does Altinköy, which is one of the recreational
and rural tourism areas hosting various recreational
activities, have sufficient volume of tourism potential?
The study is thought to be important as it will
reveal the tourism potential of Ankara-Altınköy,
which is one of both recreational and rural tourism
areas and has a limited number of studies, and
in theory, it will be crucial for the future ruralrecreation areas to provide researchers with ideas
for local governments.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Along with the change in consumers’ understanding
of travel nowadays, the 3S (sea, sun, sand)-based
holiday options, which are considered under
the umbrella of mass tourism, has undergone
a downward transformation in recent years
(Hacıoğlu and Avcıkurt, 2008: 255). Following the
announcement by the World Tourism Organization
in 1995 with regard to the damages of mass
tourism on nature and environment, the interest
of the consumer groups who have environmental
consciousness and have become more aware of
the issue have started to rotate towards alternative
tourism products and services that would minimize
the harm to the environment and nature (Dursun et
al., 2017: 9). One of the alternative types of tourism
that consumers have leaned towards is rural tourism
that allows activities in rural areas, minimizes the
harm to the environment and nature, and provides
sustainability (Fons et al., 2011; Su et al., 2019; Amir
et al., 2015).
The growing interest in rural areas over time has
led to an increase in the number of definitions of
rural tourism in the literature. However, there is no
commonly-accepted definition of rural tourism and
it seems quite difficult to come up with a definition
of generic nature (Tchetchik et al., 2008: 554).
Rural tourism brings together people, place,
consumption, mixed cultures, values, expectations
and experiences and offers tourists with a broad
recreational area to discover (Edwards et al., 2008:
1034). In the scope of this alternative type of
tourism, tourists are provided with the opportunity
to spend time in rural areas such as recreational

spots, bazaars, forests and highlands. Thus, not only
the underdeveloped touristic regions are promoted
for rural tourism but also new strategies are adopted
in order to contribute to the further development
of the region as a rural tourism destination, to
provide the local community with employment
opportunities and to generate additional income in
the region (Dursun, et al., 2017:8).
The fact that it is a type of tourism immune
to seasonality generates employment and income
sources for local people, promotes sustainable
tourism approach (Tang et al., 2013; Daugstad, 2008;
Xue et al., 2017; Démurger et al., 2010), serves as
an important advertisement tool in the promotion
of the country, embodies various and authentic
recreational activities, facilitates communication
through socialization, and allows active recreational
activities as well as passive activities in the region can
be listed as the main characteristics of the concept
of rural tourism (Hacıoğlu and Avcıkurt, 2008: 70;
Dursun et al., 2017:9; Kiper, 2006: 35; Ahipaşaoğlu
and Çeltek 2006: 87).
Many countries in Europe (France, Italy, Spain,
Germany, England, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Portugal etc.) have made notable progress
in rural tourism development (Randelli et al., 2014:
276). Some of the examples from Turkey that come
to mind in the context of rural tourism destinations
where recreational activities frequently take place are
İzmir/Şirince, Bursa/Cumalıkızık Village, Trabzon/
Uzungöl, Bursa/Safranbolu, Ankara/Beypazarı,
Fethiye/Kayaköy.
As the studies before 1980s discussing the
concept of rural tourism were reviewed individually,
it was observed that the concept was never examined
as a concept of tourism on its own (Edwards et al.,
2008: 1034).
Sub-themes of the studies carried out on the
concept of rural tourism are presented on Figure 1
below (Christou et al., 2018; Amir et al., 2015; Bravi
and Gasca, 2014; Su et al.,2019; Cucari et al., 2019;

In the light of Figure 1, researchers discussed under which sub-theme the research would be carried
out, and consequently, in the scope of the theme of “tourism potential”.

Figure 2. Map of Altınköy Which is one of the Recreational Places in Ankara/Turkey

One of the rural tourism destinations hosting recreational activities is Open-air Village Museum in
Altınköy, Ankara, which is subject to the current study. Open-air museum along with its attractions such
as forests, parks, lakes, chapel and tower offers an experience of unique and old village life and draws
the attention of many visitors with different tourist typologies. Altınköy Open-air Village Museum stands
out as the first open-air village museum in Turkey. The presence of traditional ‘çantı’ houses within the
boundaries of this open-air museum which are among cultural heritage properties in Turkey and the fact
that each house in the museum area is attributed with a specific theme have enhanced the recreational and
cultural diversity in the region (Figure 2).

METHOD
The Study Site
Field study was conducted between August and
November, 2018 in Altınköy/Turkey and nearby
recreational areas with the purpose of revealing
the tourism potential of the region, and relevant
stakeholders (local community, visitors, personnel
working in the area), who were selected via
convenience sampling method which is one of
the sub-groups of non-probabilistic sampling,
were interviewed. Considering the fact that the
individuals interviewed within the scope of the
current study may not have sufficient knowledge
about the concepts of recreational area and rural
tourism, qualitative interview technique was
preferred. Before being interviewed via face-toface interview technique, the research subjects
were provided with basic information about the
terms that they are not familiar with, and then the
researchers proceeded with the interview process.

Data Analyses
Semi-structured interview as a frequently used
technique in the scope of qualitative research
methods was adopted in the current study (Yıldırım
and Şimşek, 2013: 46). In this context, data were
collected from written sources through literature
analysis and observation. In the study, convenience
sampling method, one of the sub-groups of nonprobabilistic sampling, was used. Within the scope
of this technique (non-probabilistic sampling) that
has emerged under the umbrella of the qualitative
research tradition, a panorama of the existing
matters is acquired. The matters subject to qualitative
research are revealed in all details and by all possible
distinguishing features (Yıldırım and Şimşek, 2008;
Nastasi, 1998; Robinson, 2014; Marshall, 1996).
The research sample consists of 103 (53 visitors
and 50 working staff) individuals in total including
the staff working in the field of recreational rural
tourism and the visitors visiting the region, who
have been selected via non-probabilistic sampling
method. The sample covers male and female
respondents of the X, Y and Z generations within
the age range of 18-50. Interviews were held in
August-October 2018.
The questions were prepared according to the
research objectives determined by the common
point of view after investigating the studies

related to the recreational and rural areas and the
opinions of Altınköy staff and visitors involved in
the research on the destination. Both Altınköy was
observed by the researchers and the opinions of
the visitors and staff were continuously received
at different times. The site was visited at 2-day
intervals for 1 month. Before the research questions
were formed, the first step was to talk with the
people who knew about the destination and then
the field was visited by the researchers. Within
the scope of the development process of the semistructured interview form, the form was presented
to expert’s opinion and the experts were asked to
express their opinions and recommendations with
specific remarks as “Appropriate”, “Not appropriate”
and “Your recommendations for revise”. Clear
and comprehensible instructions and items were
acquired in accordance with the opinions and
recommendations by the experts. Throughout this
process, reliability of the questions was tested via
Miles and Huberman (1994)’s formula [Reliability =
Consensus / (Consensus + Disagreement)], and the
items with a coefficient of fit fixed at 0.70 and above
were included into interview form. The value of the
coefficient of fit indicates that interview questions
can be used at high reliability.
QSR NVivo 10, the computer-based qualitative
analysis program, was used to facilitate encoding
of the data. This program represents an inductive
coding process that focuses on identifying key
concepts, ideas, or justifications that are clearly
expressed in the data, rather than categorizing them
using pre-existing codes or questions (Vaismoradi,
Jones, Turunen and Snelgrove, 2016). The first
phase of coding begins by identifying the wide
range of temporary themes of all three authors on
research questions. In this process, the researchers
were asked to include the metaphors and motives of
interviewees in one of the draft themes/categories
that they have already listed, or to create a new
theme. The simultaneous coding efforts of all three
authors provided the consistency in the coding
process (often referred to as inter-code reliability).
No inconsistencies were spotted along the coding
process, and the process was finalized by the creation
of a codebook that includes common definitions for
each code (Lombard, Snyder-Duch and Bracken,
2002). After the finalization of the coding process by
the researchers, research findings were concluded
based on the analysis
01and interpretation of the
research data. The research findings were analyzed
and interpreted separately in the context of the
working staff and the visitors in Altınköy.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
In this chapter, findings and interpretations related to the data obtained as a result of the interviews with
the working staff in Altınköy and the visitors for the purpose of exploring the tourism potential of Altınköy
are presented separately.

Findings and Interpretations on Visitors in Research Sample
According to the findings covering 53 visitors in total, 29% of the visitors were male and 71% were female.
Examining the educational status of the visitors, it is observed that 81% of respondents have university
degree, 9% are high school graduates, 6% are primary school graduates and 2% have master’s and doctorate
degree. According to the findings on 50 personnel who were involved in the research, 20% of working staff
is male and 80% is female. When the educational status of the personnel involved in the study is examined,
it is seen that 50% graduated from primary school, 22% from high school and university and 6% from
associate degree programs.
It is observed that 74% of the respondents visited Altınköy for the first time, 6% for two times, 7% for
three times, 2% for four times, and 11% for five times or more.

As a response to the question “Do you think that the number of tourism enterprises and food and
beverage facilities in Altınköy is sufficient?”, 15% of the visitors expressed that the number is sufficient, 33%
indicated that the number is insufficient and should be increased, 43% mentioned that the facilities fall
short of providing services in the weekends, and 9% recommended enhancing the variety of menu selection
rather than increasing the number of facilities. For the same question 76% of the working staff expressed
that the number is sufficient, 18% indicated that the number is insufficient and should be increased, and
6% mentioned that the facilities fall short of providing services in the weekends. In the light of the research
results, it is seen that visitors and working staff have counter arguments regarding the sufficiency of tourism/
food and beverage facilities in Altınköy.

working staff ’s recommendations on increasing
the number of tourists in Altınköy are as follows:
“Region-specific posters and banners should be

and the travel guides/agencies can be held

In the context of the practical implications in
the current study, as general recommendations for
small regions in Turkey and abroad which operate
or are to operate in the future in a similar form
to Altınköy, the disadvantages/negativities which
are highlighted in the research findings and may
emerge in the regions with similar characteristics
with Altınköy may be taken into notice and these
disadvantageous factors may be eliminated at the
construction stage of new areas. The current study
paves the way for other studies to be conducted on
similar small regions.

There exists limited number of studies conducted
on tourism potential of rural tourism. Researchers
can contribute to the theoretical background by way
of investigating other recreational areas within the
scope of their studies focusing on small regions as in
this study, and of revealing the degree of familiarity
of the region in question. In this regard, giving
weight to the studies bearing similar characteristics
with the current one and bringing new perspectives
on the subject matter through the comparison of the
studies are considered to be of great importance in
terms of contributing to the existing literature.

ABSTRACT

T

his study examines the concept of “metaphor”, reviews various definitions of “metaphor” and
discusses figurative or metaphorical explanations of the concepts. Metaphors are alternative
approaches that are used when defining concepts, phenomena or objects. They represent the
imaginative and fictitious thoughts of individuals through different expressions. This way, a defined
concept can be explained via different words and from different directions while still bearing the same
meaning. Metaphors are considered important especially in the way that they reveal the perceptions
towards a certain concept. The aim of this study is to determine the metaphorical perceptions of the
local people of Ürgüp, which is a notable touristic destination, towards the concepts of “tourism” and
“tourist”. With this in mind, the study seeks to determine the metaphorical perceptions of the local
people towards the concepts of tourism and tourist utilizing data gathered with a semi-structured
interview form. Using the data gathered from 50 individuals living in Ürgüp, the metaphors regarding
the concepts of “tourism” and “tourist” were categorized and analyzed. According to the results, it
was determined that the metaphors towards the concept of tourism were mostly perceived in a classic
manner and metaphors towards the concept of tourist were perceived most commonly in an economic
manner. Additionally, it was found that the great majority of the metaphors developed towards both
concepts were positive perceptions, aside from the very few negative perceptions.

INTRODUCTION
There are many different definitions of tourism suggested by various researchers. Tourism was generally
defined in a spatial way initially, and the individuals who travel a certain distance to another place were
defined as tourists. More clearly; tourism is the sum of activities including individuals’ traveling outside
their places of residency and work for short and temporary periods, and the goods and services necessary
to meet their needs during their visit (Akış Roney, 2011: 3-4). The opinions on tourism of each member of
the tourism system can be different. Because of this, tourism and tourist can be expressed in a different way
for each individual.
Concepts are mostly considered with their common properties with other concepts. Sometimes, a newly
learned aspect of a concept is identified with the properties of another concept which is very well-known.
In formal or informal learning processes, metaphors can also shed light on certain concepts that are hard
to comprehend (Geçit and Gencer, 2011: 2). The term metaphor is defined as a word that is used outside
its true meaning to establish likeness (Yazçiçek, 2012: 139). Explaining a concept with metaphors also put
forth the fictitious phenomenon which said concept evokes. With these images, the feelings and notions
which are related to the concept are also comprehended to a certain extent (Ayyıldız, 2016: 15). What
increases the significance of metaphors is that they allow the projection of a mental schema on another
mental schema by establishing a certain relationship between two different phenomena (Saban, 2009: 282).
Metaphors are commonly used nowadays. Studies on metaphor analysis are utilized especially in the
01
field of educational sciences (Babacan, 2014; Kodan Çetinkaya, 2014, Hacıfazlıoğlu
vd., 2011). However,
it can be stated that studies using metaphor analysis in the field of tourism are not sufficient yet. This
study, which aims to determine the metaphoric perceptions of the local people in Ürgüp on the concepts of
“tourism” and “tourist”, is thus thought to contribute significantly to the literature on tourism.

LITERATURE REVIEW
The word “metaphor” comes from the base of
“metapherein” in Greek and means “to relay/
transfer”. Its primary meaning is defined as shifting
the usage of a word into a new one (Al-Hasnawi,
2007). The broadest definition of “metaphor” in
Turkish, which is translated as “mecaz” by the
Turkish Language Association (TDK, 2019), is the
expression of a concept or phenomenon through
the use of analogies (Aydın, 2010: 1296). In other
words, it can be defined as expressing a phrase or
idiom by likening it to another phrase which is
similar in meaning (Yazçiçek, 2012: 139).
Metaphors are clear expressions of individuals’
thoughts on the world, objects, events and actions
(Özdemir et al., 2016: 116). They can also form as
explicitly or implicitly stating that an X phenomenon
is similar to a Y phenomenon (Saban, 2009: 282). The
expressions in the metaphors may not be directly
connected to each other, but the meanings must
be parallel and should echo with each other. The
important thing in metaphors is moving from the
source to the target to, but doing this by describing
the source (Yazçiçek, 2012: 139).
Forceville (2002) emphasizes that in order for a
something to be called a metaphor, it must answer
the questions below:
t 8IBUBSFUIFUXPUFSNTPGUIFNFUBQIPS 
t 8IBUBSFUIFUBSHFUBOEUIFTPVSDFPGUIFNFtaphor?
t 8IŔDIQSPQFSUŔFTDBOCFMŔOLFECFUXFFOUIF
source and the target?
Moving on from all this information; it can be stated
that metaphors take shape when a concept, subject or
object is implicitly or explicitly expressed in another
manner. In Bayraktaroğlu et al.’s (2011) study where
the researchers examined the Faculty of Economics
and Administrative Sciences students’ perceptions on
Human Resources management using plant and animal
metaphors, it was seen that the foremost metaphor is
“bamboo”. The most commonly used metaphors for the
concept of Human Resources were “fruitless” “prunefree” and “hard to cultivate”. The most common animal
metaphor was stated to be “dog”.
Demirtaş and Çoban (2014) have examined
the student opinions on faculty members through
metaphor analysis. The research results showed that
students create mostly negative metaphors and the
most common of these were related to the aspect of
authority; while positive metaphors mostly referred
to leadership, guidance and mentorship. In another
study, the metaphors regarding the perceptions of
tour guiding students about Turkish Cuisine were
examined. The mostly referred metaphors were

400

related to nature; such as the rainbow, ocean, earth
and sun (Köroğlu et al., 2018).

METHOD
Data
The aim of this study is to determine the metaphoric
perceptions of the local people of Ürgüp regarding
the concepts of “tourism” and “tourist”. In order to
do this, a semi structured form was constructed. This
form contains the questions of “Tourism is like …,
because …” and “Tourist is like …, because …”. The
participants were informed about how to fill the forms.
They were told to fill in the blanks in the forms in 20
minutes and were allowed to write more than one
metaphor provided that they explain why. This way,
the participants were given the incentive to explain the
metaphors they have written. During the data gathering
process, it was observed that most participants took the
time to find the appropriate metaphors when filling the
form; nevertheless, most participants took less than
20 minutes to fill the form. The average time for the
participants to fill the form is roughly 15 minutes.

Sample
The findings in the study consist of the data gathered
from 50 individuals living in Ürgüp. During the
research phase, 65 individuals were given the form
but 15 forms unsuitable for gathering data were
excluded from the survey. Because of this, 50 forms
which were suitable for gathering data were taken into
consideration. Average age of the participants was
calculated as 31 (youngest was 18, oldest was 54). 52%
of the participants were male, 48% were female. 38%
of the participants had high school degrees and 46%
were university graduates. The participants included
members of different professions such as tradespeople,
workers, civil servants and teachers, as well as nonworking individuals such as housewives and students.

Data Analysis
Before getting to cataloguing the metaphors created by
participants of the study, the forms were thoroughly
examined to find the ones suitable for gathering data.
The study has excluded forms containing metaphors
which were incompatible with the explanations
or had no explanation at all; as well as ones that
had insufficient explanations or those evoking no
metaphorical perceptions (such as “tourism is travel”).
Later, the data found in the 50 suitable forms were
analyzed using content analysis.

A list of the metaphors gathered from the forms suitable to evaluate metaphoric perceptions and certain
demographic information of the individuals who created said metaphors was created in computer environment,
and later, the metaphors which were thought to be related to each other were specified and assembled together.
It was found that the participants have developed 48 different metaphors for the concept of “Tourism” and 46
different ones for the concept of “Tourist”. The metaphors towards “Tourism” were gathered under 4 categories
and the ones regarding “Tourist” were gathered under 5 categories. In order to test the categories regarding both
concepts, two experts were consulted; one being a sociologist and the other a tourism academician. It is very
important for the reliability of qualitative studies to consult with experts, and to maintain a high compatibility
between the opinions of said experts and the researchers (Creswell, 2015/2013; Yıldırım and Şimşek, 2013). the
experts were given a list containing the names of the categories and were asked to match the metaphors with the
appropriate categories. No ambiguity was found regarding the names of the category names of the metaphors.
The two experts had one different opinion each among both the “tourism” and “tourist” metaphors. The study
utilized the formula calculating the agreements and disagreements over the total number of items created by
Miles and Huberman (1994:64) to determine the reliability of the scale. Accordingly, the following formula was
used to calculate the reliability: reliability= number of agreements/ (total number of agreements + disagreements).
Thus, the level of reliability of the metaphors about the concept of tourism was found as (48/(48+1)= 0,98) and,
where the value regarding the reliability of the concept of tourist was found calculated as (46/(46+1)= 0,98) 0,98.

Findings and Discussion
The metaphors of the participants regarding the concepts of “tourism” and “tourist” are shown in Table 1.
and Table 2. Some participants were observed to have developed more than one metaphor towards these
concepts, albeit partially. Additionally, the distribution below shows that certain metaphors have been
repeated by several participants.

4th International Tourism Congress

According to Table 1 which includes the distribution of the metaphors on the concept of tourism, the
participants have written 48 different metaphors regarding the concept of tourism. The metaphors of
fun (6), investment (3), money (3), tree (2), smokeless industry (2) and commingling (2) were written
by more than one participant. Accordingly, though the most frequent metaphor was fun, metaphors
like investment and money were repeated more frequently in total. The rest were all written by singular
participants. A general evaluation of Table 1 tells us that the participants have developed different
metaphors regarding tourism. These metaphors were then gathered under categories, shown on Table 2:

The metaphors regarding tourism are categorized under 4 groups; conventional (general concepts
regarding tourism, such as analogies and definitions), life related (general concepts regarding life), economic
(monetary sources and other economic inputs) and natural (definitions regarding nature) perceptions. The
distribution between these categories are shown on Table 2. According to this, the participants have most
frequently developed metaphors under the conventional tourism perception. Following this, it was seen
that the participants tried to define tourism with the metaphors regarding life and economy. According
to Table 2, only a small portion of the participants perceive tourism as a phenomenon regarding nature.
Because of this, it can be stated that the fewest participants have tried to explain the concept of tourism with
metaphors regarding nature. Generally speaking, the metaphors regarding tourism were developed mostly
with its conventional, life related and economic aspects, while natural metaphors are less used to explain
tourism with.
The Participants’ explanations regarding their metaphors on the concept of tourism
a. Tourism as a Conventional Perception: The general definitions regarding tourism were put under this
category. This group includes metaphors such as fun (5), commingling (2), resting (1) and having

of tourist. The most frequent metaphor regarding the concept of tourist was observed to be the guest. This
is followed in order by metaphors such as bread, water, cultural richness, income, human and benefactor.
It is possible to say that the participants generally see tourists as a guest and a phenomenon with various
benefits. Additionally, metaphors regarding culture and personal features can be shown as other expressions
towards the concept of tourist.

Categories of the participant metaphors on
the concept of tourist are seen in Table 4. These
metaphors were analyzed in 5 different categories.
These are categorized as; tourist as an economic
(monetary and other material resources), relational
(closeness or the level of relationship), life related
(phenomena concerning life), characteristic
(personal, bodily or other features) and natural
(definitions regarding nature) perception. As seen
on Table 4; the metaphors are most frequently
considered as economic, relational and life related
perceptions, in that order. Following these, the
concept of tourist was most commonly described
with metaphors regarding personal characteristics.
Natural metaphors were the least used category in
describing the concept of tourist. As a result, the
concept of tourist was most commonly considered
by the participants as a monetary phenomenon. On
the other hand, it can be said that the participants
also consider the concept of tourist using phenomena
regarding daily life and relationships. Additionally,
even though the participants mostly develop positive
metaphors regarding the concept of tourist, there are
certain negative metaphors as well.

personal features stand out. Some descriptions
regarding these metaphors are as follows:

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
This study was conducted with the aim of
determining the perceptions of the local people of
Ürgüp on the concepts of “tourism” and “tourist”
through metaphors, as it is an important tourism
destination. Within the scope of the study, 48
metaphors on the concept of tourism and 46 on
the concept of tourist developed by the participants
were specified. It was found that the most common
metaphors regarding tourism were fun, investment
and money, for the concept of tourist the metaphors
were most frequently guest, bread and water. A few
metaphors have been repeated by the participants
regarding both concepts. This fewness of repeated
metaphors has enabled more diverse metaphors to
be developed and many different metaphors were
obtained. Despite that, it can be said that a small
number of participants have developed multiple
metaphors on the concepts.
The metaphors regarding the concept of
tourism were divided into 4 perception categories:
conventional, life related, economic and natural.
Among these, the most common metaphors were
under the category of tourism as a conventional
perception (fun, discovery, vacation, etc.). Following
this are the categories of life related and economic
metaphors. The least developed metaphors were the
ones regarding nature. Accordingly, it can be said
that the participants describe the concept of tourism
with its intrinsic features, such as sightseeing, having
fun, resting and exploring. Tourism’s economic
meanings come later. In this regard, it is possible
to state that tourism metaphors are mostly based
on its conventional and life related perceptions.
Özder, Kaya and Ünlü (2012) have also mentioned
in their study that the
01most metaphors regarding
tourism are based on the conventional perceptions.
In the said study, economic perception comes
after conventional, historical and cultural values.
However, this research has also found that some life
related metaphors include economic definitions,
even though in an indirect manner. In addition,

405

4th International Tourism Congress

this study’s life related metaphors constitute the most diverse category regarding tourism. The least used
category to describe tourism was natural metaphors.
Analysis of the concept of tourist shows that it is mostly regarded as an economic perception.
Despite this, the most frequent metaphor was the guest metaphor. From this point, it can be said that the
accommodating the tourist is also valued in aside from the economic perceptions of the concept. It was
found that the closeness of that participants’ relationships with the tourist is almost at the same level with
their economic perceptions, which is the most common category. The concept of tourist was also defined
with many metaphors associated to culture. Dilek, Dilek and Gümüş (2016) have determined in their
study that social and cultural perceptions on tourism are equally important as the economic perceptions.
Characteristics, which include personal features were also used when defining the concept of tourist within
the scope of this study. Again, the metaphors regarding nature were the ones least used here.
Generally, conventional tourism perception comes into the fore in the concept of tourism while for the
concept of tourist, the economic category is more prominent. This can be explained with the participants’
living in a touristic destination, because tourism’s conventional and economic effects were very well defined
in both concepts. It can be stated that the people living in a relatively small touristic region are strongly
affected by tourism in social and economic terms. Moreover, metaphors developed in both concepts were
mostly positive. However, a small number of participants have also developed negative metaphors regarding
cultural conflicts and incompatibilities, the negative effects of tourism and the bad tourist behavior. This
shows that the participants regard the concepts of tourism and tourist in a positive way.

ABSTRACT

T

he majority of world’s population living in cities under natural disaster risk requires the security
of the people and property. Many cultural heritages locate in vulnerable areas to natural disaster
because of humanity settling in such places. As a result of the sudden and devastating effects of natural disasters, culture tourism is severely affected in such countries. Turkey lived several devastating earthquakes in the past century, and due to global climate change, the country also suffers from water related
disasters in recent years. Disaster threats bring social and economic demolitions and long-term problems
that will be reflected in the whole country. This problem makes it crucial for every occupational group to
increase the urban resilience and coping capacity of the country in order to protect cultural heritage and
maintain cultural tourism activities. The existing seismic threat, increasing water related incidents and
irregular urbanization turn natural events into disasters. There are 18 places in UNESCO World Heritage
List from Turkey, and most of them are somehow under disaster threat, which damages the tourism sector to a large extent. The continuation of tourism by protecting the archaeological, historical and cultural
assets from disasters is necessary for the social and economic sustainability of the city. Therefore, the aim
of this study is to develop spatial planning strategies for Turkey in order to maintain tourism activities
after a natural disaster. In this context, this study aims to create integrated risk maps of the world heritage
sites. First, natural disasters risks are examined by extensive literature review. Second, thematic maps are
created showing natural hazards on heritage sites. Finally, spatial planning suggestions are made in order
to protect heritage sites against possible natural threats. Tourism is such an important aspect of Turkey and
maintaining the activity will increase sustainability for the economy and society.
Key Words: Natural Disaster, World Heritage Sites, Cultural Tourism, Turkey

INTRODUCTION
UNISDR reported that disasters around the world increases every year (2009) due to the urban growth in
cyclone coastal areas and earthquake-prone cities along with poor governance and disturbed ecosystems
(UNESCO, 2010). The destruction of cultural heritage sites because of natural disasters such as earthquakes
and floods result a dramatic loss as these sites have great value. It is accepted that five of the seven wonders
of the ancient time were destroyed by the earthquake: Hanging Gardens of Babylon (1st century), Statue
of Zeus at Olympia (5-6th century), Mausoleum of Mausollos (350), Colossus of Rhodes (226) and Lighthouse of Alexandria (1480) (Mark, 2009). The fact that cities are vulnerable to natural disasters causes
many historical monuments to be damaged, and this situation directly effects tourism. In 2006, the greatest
damage after the earthquake was in the Italian medieval city of L’Aquila. The historic city center was the
tourist attraction and central business district (Diez, 2012), providing income and employment (Contreras
et al, 2014). 2009 Italy Earthquake damaged Abruzzo’s tourist income; it is reported that Central Italy lost
half of its €9 billion annual income from tourism and a 40% drop in tourism in the region (Fogarty, 2017).
After the Central Italy Earthquake in 2016, it is reported that 30% decrease in tourist arrivals occurred in
the regions and even areas not affected by the earthquake directly (Tanner, 2017). In 2017, Kos earthquake
killed 2 people, and in summer 2019, severe summer storm killed six tourists in Halkidiki, Greece, risking
many heritage sites. Far from Europe, cultural heritage is damaged as natural disasters strike South America
and Asia. The Basilica Cathedral of Arequipa is damaged after the 2001 earthquake, and in 2015 Kathmandu Earthquake in Nepal show the vulnerability of cultural heritage. The Government of Nepal Department
of Archaeology indicates that one-third of the country’s important cultural heritage sites are destroyed by
the earthquake (Sonda et al, 2018). Examples in Japan continue with Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016 and
Typhoon Jebi in 2018, exposing cultural heritages to natural disasters.

Turkey is vulnerable to natural hazards, most prominently earthquakes, landslides, and floods (GFDRR, 2019). Earthquakes are one of the most destructive types of disasters because of causing many deaths
in Turkey; since the beginning of the twentieth century about 110 devastating earthquake occurred in and
the biggest losses are given in the 1939 Erzincan earthquake and the 1999 Marmara earthquake (Kılcı et al,
2015). More than 200 devastating earthquakes have occurred since 1900 in Turkey (TMMOB, 2012), and
more than half of the country’s population live under first and second-degree disaster hazard. 4 major fault
lines in Turkey are North Anatolian Fault, the Aegean Graben System, the East Anatolian Fault and Southeast Anatolia Fault, and most of the seismicity of the country depends on the North Anatolian Fault Line,
one of Europe’s and the world’s most active fault (Demarchi, 2014) (Figure 1). The North Anatolian Fault
is a relatively young active fault zone and has the potential to produce large earthquakes (Le Pichon et al,
2001), thus risking the heritage sites.

Figure 1. North Anatolian Fault (Ketin, 1976)

Along with earthquakes, Turkey suffers from extreme climate events in recent years. The size and
frequency of floods, which are closely related to climate change, varies from region to region. During the
transition period from summer to autumn, heavy rainfall causes floods and landslides in many parts of the
country, especially in crowded cities. Inadequate vegetation and steep slopes in dry areas increase the speed
of sudden floods and landslides. Erosion and unplanned urbanization are among the most important factors.
In the urban planning stage, incorrect land use decisions and inadequate rainwater drainage systems have led
to a continuous increase in the risk of sudden floods in big cities such as Istanbul and Ankara in recent years.
Most of the cities in Turkey are also the victim of irregular urbanization as a result of excessive migration
from rural to urban, especially after 1950. The plains, which are most suitable for agriculture, have been occupied
as industrial areas and settlements; therefore, resulting natural events turning into disasters. This situation also
triggers the destruction of cultural heritage sites, by population pressure along with natural threats.
The linkage of Europe and Asia, Istanbul, hosts many historical and cultural events for thousands of years,
and is one of the world’s leading natural and cultural heritage centers. Historic Areas of Istanbul is registered as
World Heritage Site in 1985 and is protected by UNESCO. Since Istanbul lies on the Anatolian Fault, historic
site is under seismic threat for centuries, and the issue has long been an important part of the country and
metropolitan agenda, all-round technical studies at the lower and upper levels of the metropolis are examined.
Disaster response experts are strengthened in both quality and quantity dimensions; architectural structures
are strengthened for a possible Marmara Earthquake expected in near future (ISMEP, 2014). However, there
are 17 other heritage sites in Turkey and unfortunately there is not as many scientific research and interest as
Istanbul for these sites.

LITERATURE REVIEW
01 to a site, how to analyze
UNESCO (2010) identified the information needed to assess the disaster risk
the factors and evaluate the hazard to prevent or mitigate disaster risks. Jigyasu and Arora examined risk
assessment for cultural heritage and identified approaches for risk prevention/mitigation for reducing disaster risks from various hazards (2013). Identification of risks includes establishing the values and significance of the heritage site; the geographical, hydrological, meteorological and seismic data; historical data
on previous disasters; detailed information of management, planning and infrastructure of the site; and

409

4th International Tourism Congress

other records of surveys and documentation (Jigyasu and Arora, 2013). ISMEP aims within the subject
of risk mitigation to protect cultural heritage property of Istanbul are to create Risk Mitigation Planning.
The study includes determining the methods, categorizing the vulnerability of historical artifacts against
disasters and creating risk mitigation plans and actions (ISMEP, 2014). Matiz Lopez proposed Integrated
Risk Assessment for Cultural Heritage Sites using AHP method (2016); Agapiou et al aims to indicate the
risk of natural and anthropogenic hazards for cultural heritage area of Paphos District by interconnecting
multi-temporal GIS and earth observation analysis (2016). AHP methodology is followed to group cultural
heritage sites with similar characteristics and threats and to estimate hazards (Agapiou et al, 2016). Bonazza
et al. conducted a study to contribute to the development of good practices to integrate cultural heritage
into national disaster and risk reduction strategies (2018). It is said that the results show protecting cultural
heritage from natural and manmade disasters still suffers from the fact that cultural heritage is not fully
considered as a risk management priority in emergency situations.
Turkey has 18 places in UNESCO World Heritage List, and most of them are somehow under
disaster threat. The existing seismic threat, increasing water related incidents along with population and
urbanization pressure lie behind the demolition risk of heritage and damage the tourism sector to a large
extent. This problem makes it crucial for every occupational group to increase the urban resilience and
coping capacity of the country in order to protect cultural heritage and maintain cultural tourism activities.
The continuation of tourism by protecting the archaeological, historical and cultural assets from disasters is
necessary for the social and economic sustainability of the city. This study aims to develop spatial planning
strategies for Turkey in order to maintain tourism activities after a natural disaster by creating integrated
risk maps of the world heritage sites.

METHOD AND CASE STUDY AREA
The study concerns World Heritage Sites in Turkey. The country has 18 properties inscribed on the UNESCO
World Heritage List and 78 sites in Tentative List. 16 of the World Heritage Sites are cultural and 2 of them
are mixed, and their registration dates vary from 1985 to 2017 (Table 1).

This study has mapped natural hazards including earthquake, flood and landslide. Earthquake hazard map
of cultural heritage sites is produced using new Turkey Earthquake Hazard Map (AFAD, 2019), placing the
sites conjecturally into the map (Figure 2). Flood hazard map is produced from Turkey Disaster Suffered
Settlements Map between 1950-2008 by Ministry of Public Works And Settlement Directorate General
of Disaster Affairs (2008) (Figure 3), and landslide hazard map is edited using Turkey Landslide Density
Map by Ministry of Public Works And Settlement Directorate General of Disaster Affairs (2008) (Figure
4). Anthropogenic hazard as urbanization is processed from aerial photo with the parameter of the site
locating in urban, rural or rural-urban fringe (Figure 5). As a result, an integrated risk table is created,
relative to natural (earthquake, flood and landslide) and anthropogenic (urban sprawl) hazards affecting
cultural heritage sites (Table 2).

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Since most of the Marmara and Aegean Region of Turkey is earthquake zone, 8 heritage sites are under earthquake hazard, excluding Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. Safranbolu is close to North Anatolian Fault, leaving
the site under hazard. Nemrut Mountain is located on Southeast Anatolia Fault; therefore it has seismic
threat that may result in volcanic activities.
Historic Peninsula of Istanbul (Akça, 2017) and Ephesus (Reimann et al, 2018) are under risk of sea level
rise; while Selimiye Mosque, Historic Peninsula of Istanbul, Safranbolu, Göreme and Diyarbakır Fortress
have flood hazard and faced with water related disasters in history according to Figure 3.
Landslide hazard map shows that landslide is not a primary threat to many cultural heritage sites. Only
City of Safranbolu has a history of damaging landslide. However, Ephesus is under the risk of erosion due
to climate change (Reimann et al, 2018), while Gobeklitepe and Çatalhöyük are exposed to wind erosion.
In Nemrut Moutain, snow slide occur during winter. In addition, sites under earthquake and flood risk also
have the possibility to face landslide incident, therefore precautions must be taken.
Diyarbakır Fortress, Great Mosque of Divrigi, Istanbul Historical Peninsula and Selimiye Mosque are
located in dense urban texture, thus have a risk of anthropogenic damage, while Göreme National Park is
mixed into rural settlement texture. Some heritage sites such as Ephesus, Pergamon and Hierapolis locate
in urban/rural fringes and they are under the threat of urban sprawl; while Xantos-Letoon is surrounded
by greenhouses intensively.
Integrated risk table of cultural heritage sites relative to natural (earthquake, flood and landslide) and
anthropogenic (urban sprawl) hazards are shown in Table 2.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION
Some of the sites are threatened by multiple hazards;
some of them are relatively safe. Even though they
are not menaced by natural hazards, they may face
anthropogenic pressure near future. For this reason,
protection and maintenance of those sites should be
a priority and national concern. Below, spatial planning strategies for UNESCO cultural heritage sites
in Turkey under the risk of disaster hazards are suggested in 4 headings.
Earthquake. Since earthquakes are generated
because of geological formation; they cannot be
prevented with today’s technology but the effect can
be mitigated. Micro-zoning maps should be generated
to better understand the earthquake hazards in
heritage sites. Historical artifacts should be examined
and strengthened if necessary against seismic hazard.
For protection of the tourists, pedestrian circulation,
both inside and outside the sites, should be planned
towards debris fall. Authorities must create emergency
evacuation plans.
Flood. On the other hand, unlike seismic
hazards, floods can be prevented with accurate
environmental planning decisions. Floods occur
in urbanized areas because of heavy rains and
impervious pavements, which causes urban storm
water run-off and stream overflow. The main
struggle today is to eliminate the effects of global
warming and to take water under control on site by
increasing infiltration as a natural drainage. Buffer
zones to store excessive water should be created
around the streams in order to prevent the streams
from overflowing. In case of sea-level rise hazard,
sites must be protected with catchment (excavation)
or dyke (filling) integrated with landscape design.
Landslide. Landslides mainly occur as a result
of seismic activities or water related disasters.
Initially, these hazards, if any, should be eliminated.
Therefore, in case of a landslide threat, necessary
precautions should be taken; surrounding hills
should be stabilized and afforested with appropriate
structural solutions to protect the heritage site.
Thematic maps indicating landslide hazard should
be generated in detail.
Urban sprawl. With growing population in the
world, it is clear that uncontrolled urban growth will
continue and risk the heritage sites especially the
ones locating already in urban areas and the fringes.
As heritage sites are absorbed into urban matrix, they
are under threat of, directly or indirectly, vibration
and contamination generated by construction
nearby and use of cars and heavy vehicles. Planning
policy should be developed against urban sprawl,

414

protecting agricultural land in general and heritage
site in specific. Public education is a key role to
minimize vandalism, destruction and stealing of
historic building materials.
As a result, a Disaster Based Integrated Risk
Management Model should be constituted for every
site in UNESCO World Heritage List and Tentative
List. With respect to many scientific research and
