A Universal Android Tourist Guide
Using the GPS Technology
Đorđe Manoilov1, Dušan B. Gajić1, Radomir S. Stanković1
Abstract – This paper describes an Android tourist guide for
mobile devices, based on the global positioning system (GPS)
technology. We present the architecture of the application and its
typical use-case scenarios. Employment of the presented
application on archaeological sites allows visitors to access
additional multimedia content and easily navigate through onsite objects. Other existing systems, aimed at similar purposes,
are mostly focused on audio content, while the presented
application also features video and 3D material. The use of XML
decouples the implementation from the content of the
application, thus allowing an almost straightforward adoption of
the presented application on different archaeological sites.

The Android tourist guide for mobile devices presented in
this paper is developed by the ARhiMedia group from the
Faculty of Electronic Engineering in Niš, Serbia. The
proposed application offers one approach to solving problems
discussed in the previous paragraph. Solutions to some of
these problems were discussed earlier in [1, 2, 3, 4], while this
study focuses on solving the problem of choosing the optimal
route. The idea for this application emerged during visits to
archaeological parks Mediana, close to Niš, Serbia, and
Iustinana Prima – Caričin Grad, near Lebane, Serbia.
The paper has the following structure. In Section II, we
present the motivation behind the development of the
application, as well as its architecture. Section III contains a
brief description of the user interface and implementation of
the application. Section IV presents the most important
conclusions, as well as plans for future work.

Keywords – Android, mobile programming, augmented reality,
cultural heritage, tourist guide, global positioning system - GPS.

I. INTRODUCTION
The application of information technologies (IT) creates
new opportunities for better presentation of cultural and
historical objects and museum exhibitions. Multimedia
presentations and applications for mobile devices make
historical sites and art exhibitions more accessible and more
interesting to a wider audience. Through their use, each visitor
can find information about an exhibition to the extent that
suits their interests. Mobile devices, such as smartphones and
tablets, recently became omnipresent in everyday human
activities. Tourism industry followed this change.
Development of digital tourist guides based on various
information technologies can greatly help in several aspects
related to tourism. In addition to helping with the complex
preparations before starting a trip, mobile applications can
help in solving the problem of lack of information about
cultural and historical attractions. Tourists have at their
disposal a number of activities, such as visiting attractions or
restaurants and shops, but they don’t have enough information
to make an informed decision. A similar problem may be
encountered during visits to archaeological parks or large
museums, due to the large number of offered exhibits and lack
of information about the preferred visiting routes. Further,
there is often a problem of timing certain activities and having
correct information about working hours of institutions.
Finding an optimal route to a desired location in an unfamiliar
place is another task made easier with mobile devices. This
task is especially difficult in large cities, where important
attractions are often distant from each other.

II. THE APPLICATION
The mobile tourist guide presented in this paper, is
developed to allow users easier navigation through
archeological parks and objects of great cultural and historical
importance which very often cover large areas. It also
provides information about objects of cultural and historical
significance, such as three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions
of objects and audio and video content about them. The
application also gives users an opportunity to dictate the pace
of the tour and to select additional information in accordance
with their interests and available time. The presented
application is already used in the digital mini-museum of the
Faculty of Electronic Engineering Niš, as a demo tourist guide
through the Niš medieval fortress and the Roman site of
Viminacium, Serbia.
A number of applications designed for similar purposes
exist. An example is an Android application Taj Mahal
Official Tour, intended for visiting the Taj Mahal in India [5].
This application contains an audio guide with a map that
shows points on which visitors can stop and hear additional
information. Another example is the Smart Tour Guide
application, created by the Korean Tourism Organization,
which contains interesting anecdotes collected from the
archives of Korean history [6]. Both applications, as well as
most of the other existing applications of similar purpose, are
devoted primarily to audio content. The tourist guide
presented in this paper puts more emphasize on video and 3D
materials. Further, the presented application is developed so
that the entire multimedia content is independent of the
implementation. Therefore, the application can be applied to
any location without additional programming, just by
changing the configuration file and adding appropriate
multimedia content.

expansion file. The remaining content is classified into folders
whit the tree structure shown in Fig 2.

A. The Application Architecture
The application is developed for mobile devices with
Android operating systems. Position between points of
interest and current position of the user is determined using
global positioning system (GPS) and device's orientation
sensors - accelerometer and compass. Functions for
communication with GPS satellites and for determining
orientation of the device are available within the Android
application framework [7].
The application architecture is shown on Fig 1. The
application consists of several forms: Compass, Map, List,
Video and form for models 3D Preview. Application logic and
multimedia data that are used are completely separated. Each
of the mentioned forms will be explained in detail later in the
text. Data that are used in the application are packed in an
expansion file, which is downloaded along with the
application from the Google Play market and stored in the
external memory of the device.

Fig. 2. Structure of the expansion file.

From the folder names, we can conclude that, for example,
the audio folder keeps the necessary audio material, model
folder stores the 3D models of reconstructed objects, etc.
Materials to be loaded into the application for a particular
object are determined by tags in the XML file. An example of
a well-configured XML file is shown in Fig 3.

Fig. 1. The application architecture.

The maximum size of application that can be placed on the
Google Play market is 50 MBs. Typically, there can be a
large number of points of interest on archaeological parks.
Therefore, there is a possibility that a lot of multimedia
content might be necessary, so the application is implemented
not to be size-limited. One possible solution are expansion
files [8]. An expansion file contains all necessary information
and is placed on Google Play along with the application. It is
possible to add two expansion files, each with size up to 2
GBs. Conceptually each expansion file plays a different role.
Main expansion file is the primary expansion file for
additional resources that are necessary in application. Patch
expansion file is optional, and it is designed for small changes
in the primary expansion file. Both expansion file can be in
any of the following formats: ZIP, PDF, MP4, etc.
Independently of the type, Google Play renames them using
the following scheme: [main|patch].<version-of-expansionfile>.<package-name>.obb.
After the download is complete, data are loaded into the
application according to the XML configuration file. For our
application, the XML configuration file is also a part of the

Fig. 3. A well-configured XML configuration file.

All important points in a site are placed within the <point>
tag and they are all grouped within the root tag <points>.
Every object contains the following tags: the <name> tag,
which defines the name of object; <latitude> and <longitude>
tags, which are used to define GPS coordinates of object; the

27

a user walks through the park, this arrow is rotated so that its
head shows the direction to the closest point.
The method of calculating the rotation angle is shown in
Fig 5. In this figure, P1 is the current user location, P2 is the
closest location of an object in the archeological park, α is an
angle between P1 and P2 in relation to the North Pole, β is an
angle of the phone, also in relation to the North Pole, and,
finally, γ (γ = α - β) is an angle for which it is necessary to
rotate the arrow so that its head shows the direction of the
closest point.

<radius> tag which represents radius around the object in
meters, within which users can hear additional information
about object. An audio file which will be played for an object
is defined with the <file> tag. When a user is found within a
defined radius of the object, he also has the possibility to see
image of the object, video, or a 3D reconstruction of the
object. This is all specified with the <img>, <video> and
<model> tags, respectively. If there is a 3D reconstruction of a
given object, it is necessary to export the model and its
textures from the expansion file. After that, it is possible to
successfully load it into the application. Files which need to
be exported are defined using the <item> tags. All <item>
tags are grouped within the <model_items> tag. For adding
new points, its necessary to add the <point> tag, which
contains all of the mentioned tags.

III. THE USER INTERFACE AND IMPLEMENTATION
The welcome screen of the application is shown in Fig 4a.
In the top of the screen, a user can see the distance to the
closest object, radius around, and the current accuracy of the
GPS signals received from satellites. All distances are shown
in meters, and calculations are based on the user’s current
GPS coordinates and the coordinates of the closest object in
the archeological park.
In the case when GPS signal is not available or it is lost,
user’s last known location is used for calculations. This last
known location is provided by a function called
getLastKnownLocation [9]. Current GPS position of the user,
which includes latitude and longitude coordinates, is stored in
the device local memory using two double-precision floating
point variables, one for each coordinate. Therefore, memory
requirements for storing GPS data are measured in bytes,
while the typical available device memory is in GBs.

Fig. 5. Method for calculating the rotation angle.

When the user enters within the radius determined for an
object, the application starts the corresponding audio file
which is pre-defined in the XML file. This audio file can
contain ambient sounds characteristic for an object, or
additional information about it. Further, instead of an arrow,
the application shows an image of the object. The main
function of the image is to show to the user the reconstruction
of object, if it is not preserved in its entirety, or to show an
image of a mosaic, if it is, for protection, covered with sand.
The previously described screen is shown in Fig 4b.
When a user is within the radius of an object, he can view a
video clip about the object or a 3D model of its
reconstruction. These two features are optional, and if they
exist, buttons 3DPreview and Video, respectively, are shown
to the user.
By choosing the option 3DPreview, the screen an example
of which is shown in Fig. 7a is presented to the user. This
application module is realized using Metaio Mobile SDK.
Metaio is a tool which is primarily intended for developing of
augmented reality applications for Android and iOS mobile
devices, but it can be used for the implementation of this
module [10].

Fig. 4. a) Welcome screen of the application. b) The application
screen shown when a user is within the object radius.

With simple finger gestures, a user can rotate the model and
thus view it from all sides. Zoom options are also
implemented. In the top right corner, there is a model which
represents x, y, and z axis, in order to provide users easier
interaction with an object.

Besides these information, there is a compass in form of
arrow in the bottom of the screen. Its purpose is to provide
users easier positioning within the archaeological park. When

provides easier navigation through archeological sites using
the GPS, accelerometer, and compass, which are available on
almost all current mobile devices. Further, it provides textual
information and audio and video contents about objects on the
site. The presented application can be applied to any location
without the need for additional programming, since its content
is completely decoupled from its implementation.
Plans for future work include the implementation of an
augmented reality module. The main functionality of this
module will be to show the real-world environment
augmented by 3D models of reconstructed objects in a
common screen.

Selecting the Video option shows the user a form with a
full-screen video about the object. A frame from an example
video is shown in Fig 8.

On the top of the screen within the Action bar, there are two
more options [11]. The first option is Map, which provides an
overview of the entire archeological park and objects of
interest. Objects are marked on the map as pins, and a pin
which is the closest to the user is animated in order to be
located easily. This form is realized using Google Maps. For
our application, we used the Google Maps API version 2 [12].
An example of using this functionality of the application is
shown in Fig 7b. Another option within the Action bar shows
a list of all objects of interest within the park.
All of the previously described application layouts are
designed as responsive, which means that they are not
dependent on neither screen resolution nor size.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
The application presented in this paper - A universal tourist
guide based on the GPS technology - is implemented as an
Android application for mobile devices. The application
