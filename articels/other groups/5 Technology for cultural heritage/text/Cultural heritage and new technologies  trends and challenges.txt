The relationship between the cultural heritage (CH)
domain and new technologies has always been complex
and dialectical, often characterized by the pursuit of technologies that can become a ‘‘deadweight’’ during users’
cultural experiences.
Innovative applications and services can shorten the
distance between cultural spaces, such as museums, art
exhibition, historical center and archeological parks, and
citizens: Technology can become a facilitator of interactions and connections between all involved actors, and
where interventions can be sustainable, where enjoyment
can be enhanced and where people can learn more effectively about culture.
Some important challenges still exist, such as supporting
users when inside a cultural space, design interoperable and
noninvasive ICT solutions, and managing the cultural
knowledge.
These challenges are the focus of this theme issue, where
international experts all over the world have presented and
discussed state-of-the-art solutions and current trends related to the application of new technologies, methodologies
and techniques in the cultural heritage domain.
Twelve papers were accepted for this issue.

The paper [1] entitled ‘‘Social Recommendation Service
for Cultural Heritage’’ proposes a novel recommender
system to individual and group based on artwork features
and user experience. Specifically, a novel architecture of
recommender system to individual and group based on the
features of artwork, context of user and social affinity
between users from user experience is illustrated and discussed. The rationale behind the research idea derives from
the need to personalize the visitors access to cultural
objects, to their knowledge and connections, of a typical
cultural space, and to ensure that content and technological
containers are effective with respect to its end users.
The paper [2] entitled ‘‘Experiencing Touchless Interaction with Augmented Content on Wearable Head
Mounted Displays in Cultural Heritage Applications’’
describes an interactive wearable AR system to augment
the environment with cultural information, since the integration of touchless interaction and augmented reality is
particularly challenging. The experimental results show the
robustness of the proposed method in different scenarios,
with various lighting conditions, in terms of the accuracy
and sensitivity of the fingertip detection and of the realtime applicability.
The paper [3] entitled ‘‘Questions-Matrix Method
According to Divided Dimensions of Infographics Evaluation’’ aims to draw the essential summary according to the
important issue of infographic evaluation, for the audience
can find the way to improve and create the better infographics, since the visual/image is a very good expression
in the cultural heritage domain. To design good infographic, experimental results suggest to focus on the story,
tell it nicely, simple and beautiful in good design.
The paper [4] entitled ‘‘Using Gamification to Discover
Cultural Heritage Locations from Geo-tagged Photos’’
discusses and analyzes an interesting tool, named

188

PhotoTrip, able to autonomously recommend charming,
even if not mainstream, cultural heritage locations along
travel itineraries. In particular, the proposed solution
exploits social networks, crowdsourcing and gamification
in order to involve users. After an user evaluation stage for
a period of four months, authors claim that common users
are effective in helping the system to remove non-relevant
photos, even when they have not been previously taught
about the meanings of relevant and non-relevant.
The paper [5] entitled ‘‘Innovative Technologies for
Intangible Cultural Heritage Education and Preservation:
the Case of I-Treasures’’ presents a research study focused
on the role of the technology in Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) preservation and education. In particular, the
authors discuss the experience carried out within an
European project named I-Treasures. In details, this
research offers an innovative and dynamic evaluation
method, where evaluation is not restricted on the static
elements of the data collected by questionnaires, but goes
beyond and proposes a structural equation methodology,
where the performance of the platform is evaluated by the
components that constitute the platform and by the relationships that exist between these components.
The paper [6] entitled ‘‘Identifying and Ranking Cultural Heritage Resources on Geotagged Social Media for
Smart Cultural Tourism Services’’ presents a twofold
research aim: (1) identifying useful cultural heritage
resources from geotagged social media and (2) ranking
them with respect to the user context. Conducted experiments show that selected a particular geolocation, current
social media data combination with ICT, it is possible to
find interesting information for tourists, providing dynamic
information in favor of any travel agents.
The paper [7] entitled ‘‘Tangible Data Souvenirs as a
Bridge between a Physical Museum Visit and Online
Digital Experience’’ explores the value of personalized
tangible data souvenirs as a bridge between the physical,
personal experience of the visit and the digital online
experience of staying engaged within a museum environment. The experimental phase has taken into account the
logs and also gathered data documenting the experience of
visitors to the exhibition, including interviews and observation. The results show that the uptake of the souvenir was
affected by factors outside our control, i.e., the exhibition
layout and signage on the exhibit floor.
The paper [8] entitled ‘‘Context-Based Infomobility
System for Cultural Heritage Recommendation: Tourist
Assistant—TAIS’’ presents an infomobility system named
Tourist Assistant (TAIS) for supporting tourists in a region.
In particular, the system solves both main tasks related to
the infomobility concept: the user actions analysis, the
preferences revealing and the cultural heritage recommendation based on the preferences and current situation.

The evaluation phase shows that system finds and ranges
the cultural heritage around by the feasible time and can be
used for the on-the-fly tourist support during the trip.
The paper [9] entitled ‘‘Visualizing Museum Visitors’
Behavior: Where Do They Go and What Do They Do
There?’’ presents a framework for collecting and analyzing
information about museum visitors’ behavior that relies on
user-centered design (UCD) process. Authors conducted
several interviews with museum curators and personnel in
order to understand the requirements of a system that
would help them analyze visitor behavior. Initial results
from the evaluation are very supportive, suggesting that
such a system can be a valuable tool for evaluation of
museum exhibit design.
The paper [10] entitled ‘‘Confucius Computer—A
Philosophical Agent for Intergenerational Philosophical
Play with a Computer’’ presents the design of a system that
permits experiencing Confucius teachings virtually and
interactively, re-acquainting users with an intangible heritage. The proposed system can measure philosophical
intent of the human and generate a meaningful philosophical answer. With glass-box evaluation, the system is
able to identify the keywords and topics with an accuracy
of 88.72 and 81.20%, respectively. Moreover, an accuracy
of 42.59% was obtained using k-NN method. With a blackbox evaluation, more than 70% of the users gave rating of 4
(agree) or 5 (strongly agree) for the enjoyment and relevance of virtual Confucius’s response to their input sentence or question.
The paper [11] entitled ‘‘Semantic Infrastructure of a
Smart Museum: Towards Making Cultural Heritage
Knowledge Usable and Creatable by Visitors and Professionals’’ presents a theoretical work, which is a mandatory
phase of complex system engineering, discussing a smart
museum concept based on services with high intelligence
level when additional historical sources can be used to
semantically enrich the museum collection, including
knowledge acquired from visitors and museum professionals. Authors have considered a concept prototype for
the selected case study of the History Museum of
Petrozavodsk State University, targeting the requirements
coming from the museum application domain and with
concrete services that such a museum needs.
The paper [12] entitled ‘‘Blended Context-Aware
Ubiquitous Learning in Museums: Environment, Navigation Support, and System Development’’ presents a novel
learning framework, namely blended context-aware ubiquitous learning (b-learning). To compare the efficacy of
this new proposed framework with other learning platforms, a field experiment of the learning activity, ‘‘Rocks
and Fossils,’’ was conducted in the National Museum of
Natural Science, Taiwan. Experimental results demonstrate
that the learners had better learning achievements while

Pers Ubiquit Comput (2017) 21:187–189

learning in the proposed b-learning environment. Authors
suggest that further research is needed to verify the effects
of b-learning on learners’ motivation.
We would like to appreciate all authors for their valuable contributions to this theme issue.
