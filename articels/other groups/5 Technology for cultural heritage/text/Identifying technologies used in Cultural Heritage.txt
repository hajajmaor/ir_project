Abstract
There are a growing number of Information Communication Technology (ICT) applications in cultural heritage.
However despite funding constraints, projects often involve similar or even duplicate work carried out at the same
site. This emphasizes the need for an enterprise whose purpose is to coordinate research projects in this field. The
EPOCH programme has been established to address this requirement. This paper focuses on the development of a
diagram depicting the technologies used in cultural heritage research from papers presented at VAST 2003. The aim
of this paper is to draw together technologies currently being used by researchers in the cultural heritage sector in
order to direct future research in this field.
1. Introduction
Although numerous ICT applications are used by the
cultural heritage sector, to date there has been no
study on the range of applications available and
hence cultural heritage and IT professionals often
work in isolation, when they could be harnessing
opportunities derived from techniques, tools and
methodologies used by other researchers.
This paper presents a systematic study that identifies
the technologies used in research presented at VAST
2003.
This was undertaken by adopting an
information systems theory approach [LL00]
classifying procedures into three activities: input,
process or output.
The paper adopts the proposition that cultural
heritage comprises a series of three stages. It begins
with the Discovery of artefacts; followed by
Scientific Process which involves documentation,
digital reconstruction and cataloguing. The final
stage is Dissemination to both professionals and the
general public.
This study has set out to generate a comprehensive
flow diagram or ‘inventory map’ that depicts the
range of technologies and techniques used within
cultural heritage. An information systems approach
was adopted because it offered a comprehensive

framework for analysis.
A further diagram
summarises the technology currently being used in
the cultural heritage field.
The objective of this research is to identify trends in
technologies used within cultural heritage, in order to
support scientific exchange between relevant parties.
The resulting inventory map identifies techniques, as
well as hardware and software used. The summary
diagram depicts a synopsis of technologies being
used by VAST 2003 researchers.
2. Cultural Heritage and ICTs
An Information System can be defined as "a set of
interrelated components that collect (or retrieve),
process, store and distribute information to support
decision making and control in an organisation. In
addition … information systems may also help
managers and workers … visualize complex subjects"
[LL00 pp 7].
Typically an Information System contains three
activities:
Input: captures or collects the raw data
Processing: converts this raw input into a more
meaningful form
Output: transfers the processed information to
people who will use it or to the activities for which it
will be used [LL00, pp 7].

R. Owen, D. Buhalis & D. Pletinckx / Identifying technologies used in Cultural Heritage

Applying this to cultural heritage, input can be
termed as “Discovery”. This includes field research
such as excavations, scientific discoveries and all the
technologies and processes used within the field.
This provides data that is used in the Scientific
Process phase (process) where information about
artefacts is collected and combined with other related
items, documented and prepared for the output or
Dissemination phase.
In this phase processed
information, images and artefacts can be used by
cultural heritage professionals through databases and
digital displays for further research, as well as by the
general public visiting museums and cultural heritage
sites.
2.1. Stages of the cultural heritage process and
ICT applications

Reconstruction technology enables 3D models of
artefacts to be generated from fragments found at the
excavation site. This speeds up the process of
documentation and classification [KM03; MTL03].
Monuments can be reconstructed to depict their
original appearance. This can provide a source of
added value. For instance the reconstruction of the
Parthenon research project aimed to reassemble its
sculptures, which are currently distributed in
museums throughout the world. This resulted in a 3D
model of the Parthenon. The researchers found that
the viewer was able to appreciate the structure more,
because by placing the sculptures in their correct
locations, the relationships between them became
more apparent [ST03].
2.1.3.

Dissemination

2.1.1. Discovery Phase - Documentation
2.1.3.1. Professionals
During an excavation, the site and artefacts found are
recorded for documentation purposes. Lopez [2003]
observes a strong resistance amongst archaeologists
to adopting new technology because they do not see
that they have any real advantages over traditional
methods of recording a site using photography and
illustration.
Lopez believes that there are situations where
technology benefits archaeologists: Digital cameras
allow the archaeologist to take a more exhaustive
record of the subject, as costs of processing images
are less than when using an ordinary camera.
Furthermore the instant processing capability of a
digital camera allows the archaeologist to confirm in
situ that the subject is documented, whereas
previously they may have developed the photos at
home, only to discover that they are unusable.
Access to images of artefacts can be obtained in the
field through using portable electronic devices such
as laptop or palmtop computers, using databases to
compare images with the artefact found. This assists
the documentation process. Moreover images are
quicker to access in a database, than searching
through archive boxes.
2.1.2. Scientific Process - Reconstruction
Technology addresses the problems arising from
manual reconstruction. These include the fact that it
can be time consuming [MTL03], prone to error, for
example one artist may illustrate a subject slightly
differently to another [KM03], expensive and labour
intensive [ST03]. Technology aims to minimise
these drawbacks.

Many projects presented in VAST 2003 concentrated
on advancing technology and used an artefact or
sculpture as their test subject. Some resulting papers
included a URL where their results could be obtained
over the web [ST03]. Other projects involved
designing web interfaces to databases thus making
collections accessible over the Internet [Lop03;
CIG*03; SSE03]. This increases the amount of
information available to researchers and also enables
the general public to access images from museum
collections for their own purposes.
2.1.3.2. General public
In 1991 Merriman [in Ric96] predicted that cultural
heritage sites would make a greater use of visual
display, which would replace text based formats of
interpretation. Today there are many technologies
that can assist in presenting information for example
virtual reality, augmented reality and interactivity.
Caulton [1999] observes that traditionally the curator
of a museum was appointed due to their specialist
knowledge on the subject matter of the collection.
The safeguarding of the collection was paramount
and visitor needs were regarded as being less
important, especially as most of the funding received
was derived from public sources. Nevertheless there
were some museums that decided to invest in
interactive technologies and this is thought to have
raised expectations and pressure from visitors which
resulted in many other heritage establishments facing
static or decreasing visitor numbers, along with a
reduction in funding by the public sector. [Dav95, in
Cau99] This gave rise to new initiatives including
exhibition redesign, to increase educational
effectiveness [Cau99].

In contrast to falls in funding levels, visitors are
becoming increasingly discerning in their evaluations
of attractions and are more demanding. The growth
of international travel has resulted in the customer
comparing the attraction with the best in the world
[Ano01]. Moreover people are comparing across
sectors and judge the attraction in the context of the
best hotels, cinemas and shopping centres they have
experienced [Ano01].
Museums and galleries in the UK (and throughout
Europe) are being pressurised by governments and
local authorities to widen audiences and make their
collections culturally and intellectually accessible to
everyone [Dav01]. Visitors may differ in their
requirements for depth of understanding on the
subject matter of the museum [Sil95; Mun96;
MdC02] and it is also believed that the depth of
information required may differ according to the
exhibit. Technology can now accommodate different
information requirements.
In some mobile
applications such as pen tablet PCs, the commentary
can be dynamically adjusted to user’s walking speed
and time spent at the exhibit [TC03; VPD*03].
Such is the competition involved in attracting visitors
[Cau99] that there is a need to make the visitor
experience as pleasurable as possible and one way to
do this would be to 'entertain' the visitor [Ben99].
This trend of entertaining the visitor, whilst at the
same time providing education, is called
'edutainment' [Buh03]. Virtual reconstructions allow
the visitor to “effortlessly learn whilst being
entertained” [PGC03 pp 193]. Avatars and virtual
electronic tour guides enable the provision of
multimedia representations and reconstructions that
make the exhibits livelier [LS03] and provide a sense
of personalisation bringing a more human feel to the
technology.
3. Methods / Procedures
The aim of this study is to construct an inventory of
technologies currently utilised within cultural
heritage and determine the technologies most
frequently being used. The purpose of this research
is that it can support scientific exchange between
relevant parties and cultivate innovations throughout
the process
This research constitutes exploratory research
because not much is known about the subject [Sek00]
at this present time. The research procedure began by
investigating secondary data sources to acquire
instances of technologies and techniques used to
transform data. However at the present time, the
secondary data sources used were limited to papers
presented at VAST 2003. These were examined to
produce a comprehensive diagram, based on
c The Eurographics Association 2004.

information systems theory. Thus the techniques
implemented were classified using input, process and
output theory. The resulting diagram is depicted in
figures 1 and 2.
During the construction of this diagram it was found
that there was an input, process and output stage for
the project overall and also for each procedure.
Regarding the project overall, this is represented by
dividing the diagram into three columns separated by
dotted lines. The input, process and output for each
procedure was depicted on the diagram by using
different coloured boxes. Also arrows underneath
these boxes represent processes that can be repeated.
For example multiple scans need to be taken of a
subject to enable full, comprehensive coverage.
The analysis of VAST 2003 papers clearly
demonstrated a Discovery Phase where data and
artefacts are being transformed, a Scientific Phase
which involves processing, cataloguing and image
development and the Dissemination process, where
information was prepared and presented in a form
suitable to be consumed by both cultural heritage
professionals and the general public.
The numbers in boxes on the left hand side of the
diagram correspond to the project number, or in other
words the order in which they appeared in the VAST
2003 conference notes. At the bottom of each project
are HW and SW boxes. This stands for hardware and
software and the respective tools were reported where
they were specified in the literature. These were also
linked to show which projects were using the same
hardware and software.
Once the activities of the project had been sorted, it
then became clear that there were projects using the
same technologies. This is depicted on figures 1 and
2 by dotted lines which connect two or more boxes
together (one connector per project). The relevant
technology is shown in capital letters in each box.
Figure 3 condenses the projects into technologies
used. It adheres to the three stage archaeological
process defined in this paper of discovery, scientific
process and dissemination. Therefore a summary of
technologies currently used in cultural heritage and
how they are interrelated is presented.

4. Results

4.4. Summary diagram of technologies used

Figures 1 and 2 show that there were instances where
the same technologies were being used by different
projects and also that some hardware such as
scanners and digital cameras were repeatedly utilised
for data acquisition. Researchers most frequently
used their own proprietary software.

Figure 3 demonstrates that the techniques used within
cultural heritage projects presented at VAST 2003
can be summarised into recording, modelling,
visualization and interpretation.

4.1. Discovery – documentation
Images, text and other multimedia were converted
into a digital format and then stored in a repository,
usually a database. It is becoming increasingly
important to develop a common electronic repository
to
store
text,
images
and
multimedia
(http://www.ssl.co.uk/) due to an increase in
applications. Databases had a dual functionality of
storage and search capabilities. Research projects
utilized the web to enable access to study findings
and often museum collections remotely.
4.2. Scientific process – Reconstruction
Multiple images were taken of the same subject to
ensure that as much detail was collected as possible.
Images overlaid one another using geometric coordinates. However superfluous data was often
removed to reduce the file size of the model and to
speed up its operations.
4.3. Dissemination
4.3.1. Professionals
There was a general trend towards increasing the
amount of information that researchers had access to,
particularly disseminating results over the web in
terms of presenting findings, or producing searchable
databases.
In a museum context, often the
installations would cater for both the general public
and researchers who could test out hypotheses at their
leisure.
4.3.2. General Public
The projects focused on interactivity enabled visitors
to learn by doing. Users could select the subject they
wish to receive further information on. Therefore
they could concentrate on subjects they are
particularly interested in, instead of having to watch
an entire linear presentation.
Wireless technological applications focused on
developing electronic tour guides. These harnessed
the context specific capabilities of a mobile device,
by presenting information which directly related to
the exhibit viewed. Information was also sent to
visitors in accordance with time spent viewing the
exhibit.

Recording could be viewed as ‘data acquisition’
technologies. Part of this process may involve
converting one technology (such as slides) into
another, so that it can be used in computer
applications. For example producing a digital image
of a slide.
Modelling can be described as putting data into a
specific order.
Mesh adjustments encompassed
positioning and aligning different meshes to increase
the detail about an overall image. Orientation
involves positioning fragments to estimate size and
therefore determine the vessel’s appearance. Image
adjustments involve ordering images, for example
stitching images into panoramas for output in a new
application. Data management involves putting data
into a structure.
Visualization is where information is sorted into a
format for the purpose of making it more accessible.
Accessibility can be in two ways. Firstly a 3D model
of a sculpture enables the visitor to view its image
remotely, rather than being physically present at the
exhibit. Accessibility can also be in terms of
promoting understanding. For example presenting
the subject in a visual way such as a walkthrough, or
augmented reality helps to explain the subject.
Databases visually depict the relationships between
one subject and another. This can be seen when the
user inputs their search criteria and the results are
displayed. In the diagram databases are placed away
from other visualization techniques. This is to reflect
the fact that databases may be used to store other
visualisation technologies such as 3D models,
augmented reality images etc. Placing databases to
the right of other visualisation technologies
emphasises there may be another stage between
visualization and interpretation. For example a 3D
model is developed first and then is stored on a
database. Digital photographs may be stored directly
on the database and the diagram reflects this fact.
Interpretation is divided into interpretation for:
professionals and the general public. Sometimes
technologies can be used for both categories. For
example professionals and the general public can use
web accessible databases for their own purposes.
This is reflected on the diagram by showing the same
text box in both categories. For brevity and to avoid
confusion, the arrows from visualization technologies
are only linked to either professional or general
public examples (not both). The horizontal arrows in

162

between the boxes show that the visualization
technologies apply to both categories.

Figures 1 – 2 show that scanning and digital
photography are the most frequently used forms of
data acquisition technologies used in recording.
Scientific process focused on image development and
data management. Dissemination involved up to a
three step process: enhancing information about a
subject, perhaps storing on a database (or at least in
computer files) and interpretation for professionals
and / or the general public.

5. Conclusions
The research process has proved that is possible to
depict an inventory of technologies used in cultural
heritage, although at this present time it has been
limited to the technologies presented at the VAST
2003 conference. Therefore it does not give full
coverage of the archaeological process, but provides
a useful starting point.

The research found that each project consisted of a
Discovery, Scientific Process and Dissemination
stage and that within each stage there involved input,
process and output activities.
Furthermore
procedures were often repeated (such as scanning
different parts of a sculpture) until all the necessary
data was transformed.
This paper enables the reader to identify technologies
applied within cultural heritage and found that
technology was used in four main ways: recording,
modelling, visualization and interpretation.
It is envisaged that further work will involve an
examination of additional publications concerning
technological developments in cultural heritage.
Primary research involving representatives from
cultural heritage organisations will also be carried
out. This will consist of questions to identify the
technologies currently being used within cultural
heritage sites and to obtain information about future
initiatives involving technological applications within
their establishments. Furthermore their opinions of
cost and benefits of technology will be gathered.
