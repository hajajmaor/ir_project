Abstract: Mixed reality technology is being increasingly used in cultural heritage attractions to
enhance visitors’ experiences. However, how the characteristics of mixed reality affect satisfaction
and brand loyalty has not been explored in previous research. The purpose of this study is to
identify factors affecting satisfaction with mixed reality experiences at cultural and artistic visitor
attractions and their influence on brand loyalty, which is connected with management performance.
We propose a theoretical model based on brand equity theory in the context of mixed reality
experience. Survey data were gathered from 251 respondents visiting a cultural and artistic visitor
attraction in Seoul, Korea, using a stratified sampling method. Partial least squares structural
equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed for the data analysis. The results suggest that the
characteristics of mixed reality (interactivity, vividness) not only influence the affective aspects
(perceived immersion, perceived enjoyment) of visitors’ experiences, but also positively affect brand
awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty.

1. Introduction
As 5G provides very high data rates, extremely low latency, and significant improvement in users’
perceived quality of service (QoS), it is expected to become more widespread in the coming years
particularly in urban areas [1]; hence, interest in developing mixed reality content with high user
acceptance is increasing. Mixed reality content has traditionally been used for games [2], education [3],
training [4], tourism [5], and cultural exhibitions [6]. Satisfaction with cultural and artistic exhibitions
has been linked to the consumption of souvenirs and visitor attractions. Accordingly, researchers have
examined the factors affecting construction and operation of exhibitions by public institutions and
private companies [7]. Case studies focused on planning, composition, and exhibition content have
demonstrated that visitor satisfaction with exhibition experiences can be increased by adding various
information technologies, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holograms.
Integration of mixed reality technology into cultural and artistic attractions is expected to contribute to
a richer visitor experience [8].

As with any other organizations, the sustainability of cultural and artistic visitor attractions
consists of four elements including the cultural environment (e.g., heritage preservation,
new audiences), social environment (e.g., engagement, social responsibility), natural environment
(e.g., green technologies, energy efficiency), and economic environment [9]. Economic aspects can
be supported by increasing visitor numbers and net growth [10]; hence, when considering factors
that facilitate the continued operation of cultural and artistic visitor attractions, it is necessary to
study factors affecting visitor satisfaction [11] and souvenir purchase [12]. This information is of
interest to corporate executives and practitioners. However, empirical research is lacking on the
characteristics of mixed reality and their connection to user satisfaction and brand loyalty in the
context of cultural and artistic visitor attractions. Although one study examined development of the
experimental environment and proof of concept [13], the effects of the technical characteristics of mixed
reality on satisfaction or purchase intention have rarely been studied [14].
The marketing efforts of cultural organizations tend to be focused on sustaining and creating
loyalty [15], which can be affected by brand equity [16–18]. Customer-based brand equity (CBBE),
which can be defined as the added value of a brand to a customer [19], is said to reinforce brand loyalty
and brand preference, attract new customers, and generate greater resiliency to competitors’ marketing
actions, enabling the brand to earn consistent, predictable, and higher market shares over time [20].
According to early research [21,22], brand awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty are three
key attributes of brand equity that must be perceived positively by the consumer for brand equity to be
achieved. Hence, brand equity is formed when a brand known to the consumer is perceived as positive
and unique with strong associations [23]. For organizations, brand equity is important because of its
ability to influence positive affect and attitudes, which manifest themselves in consumer behaviors
such as purchase intention and repeat visitation [23]. Brand equity theory has been utilized in research
conducted in both cultural (e.g., [24,25]) and technological contexts (e.g., [19]). However, to date,
there is limited research employing a brand equity perspective to investigate the influence of visitors’
mixed reality experience on brand equity in the context of cultural and artistic visitor attractions
through empirical research using quantitative approach. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this
research gap, and as a result, it offers important implications for managers of such organizations in
addition to making a theoretical contribution to research in this area.
More specifically, the purpose of this study is to examine how two characteristics of mixed reality
(interactivity, vividness) affect the affective aspects (perceived immersion, perceived enjoyment)
of visitors’ experiences of and satisfaction with cultural and artistic attractions. In addition,
we investigate the effects of the characteristics of mixed reality on brand awareness, brand association,
and, eventually, brand loyalty, which is connected to the management of cultural and artistic visitor
attractions. We use brand equity theory as the theoretical background and conduct an empirical analysis
with visitors to a specific cultural and artistic attraction in which mixed reality has been implemented.
This paper begins with a theoretical background exploring previous literature on the
implementation of mixed reality in cultural heritage attractions, followed by an overview of brand
equity theory. A justification for each of the proposed hypotheses is then presented, which is followed by
the method detailing the quantitative data collection and analysis. Finally, discussions and conclusions
including theoretical contributions and practical implications are offered.
2. Theoretical Background
2.1. Mixed Reality in Cultural Heritage Attractions
Cultural heritage-related curated spaces, including art galleries and museums, compete for
cultural visitors’ time. They are under pressure to create appealing and individual experiences that
attract visitor’s attention [26]. Immersive technologies such as mixed reality (MR), AR, and VR have
become increasingly used in cultural heritage attractions, providing experiences through a combination
of real and digital content [27]. Several studies focus on the application and use of both AR and VR in

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

3 of 22

urban cultural heritage attractions. These studies are written from various perspectives, including the
impacts of AR on urban heritage tourism (e.g., [28]), value of AR from stakeholders’ perspectives
(e.g. [29]), experiential learning with AR in museums (e.g., [30,31]), AR acceptance in urban heritage
tourism (e.g., [32,33]), and experiencing AR and VR in art galleries and museums (e.g., [34,35]).
By comparison, fewer studies have focused on mixed reality (e.g., [5,36]), which can be defined as
“the combination of virtual computer graphics and real-world elements into a virtual environment”
([26] p. 89). Powered by mobile devices or HMD(Head Mounted Display)s, mixed reality can enrich the
user’s experience by providing enhanced information through multisensory modalities such as video,
audio, touch, and scent. Mixed reality enhances the user’s experience of the surrounding environment.
Two characteristics of mixed reality can enhance users’ experience of a cultural heritage attraction.
Feelings of presence tend to occur when a virtual environment provides high levels of interactivity
and vividness [37–39]. Interactivity allows users to manipulate the virtual environment in real
time [40] and is perceived to be one of key determinants of enjoyment in interactive systems [41].
Vividness (i.e., “the ability of a technology to produce a sensorially rich mediated environment”; [39]
p. 80) and interactivity are two important media features of mixed reality. In AR research, vividness
and interactivity have been found to influence consumer evaluations positively through increased
immersion [42]. In addition, AR offers increased interaction through 3D virtual objects, and system
quality has been found to enhance learning effectiveness and learner satisfaction with the learning
environment [43].
By connecting information and material reality, mixed reality can make the invisible visible in
situ, allowing visitors to experience the space, its history, and a community simultaneously [26].
The stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model [44], which asserts that a stimulus (S) may influence an
organism (O) that in turn influences behavior (R), was one of the first models developed to investigate
the influence of atmosphere on customer behaviors; this approach continues to be used widely
today [45] in immersive technology research (e.g., [46]), among other fields of study. As mixed reality
technologies continue to advance, their potential applications in hybrid spaces increase and become
more widespread [26]. Although researchers have begun to investigate how mixed reality can be
integrated into urban cultural heritage experiences (e.g., [14]), research in this area is largely still in its
infancy, and no comprehensive framework has been developed for evaluating these novel experiences
and their multiple dimensions of adoption, usability, engagement, immersion, presence, and physical
awareness [26]. As highlighted by Trunfio and Campana [47], further investigation is also required
into the influence of mixed reality on visitor experience and value propositions in such spaces.
2.2. Brand Equity Theory
Brand equity has been an important marketing concept since the 1980s [48] and has recently become
an increasingly important concept for cultural organizations [49]. Many studies on customer-based
brand equity (CBBE) rely on the models created by Aaker [21] and Keller [22,50]. Although these
two authors conceptualized brand equity differently, they both generally defined the concept from
a consumer-based perspective [51]. Brand equity is generally considered a multidimensional
construct [19]. According to Aaker, it comprises brand awareness, brand association, perceived quality,
brand loyalty, and other proprietary assets (e.g., patents, registered trademarks, and so on), which must
be perceived positively by the consumer for brand equity to be achieved [21,52]. Brand awareness
plays an important role in CBBE [22]; it refers to a) consumers’ ability to recall, recognize and
connect with a brand (via brand name, logo, symbol, etc.), linking it with certain associations in
memory (depth of brand awareness), and b) the range of purchase and consumption situations in
which the brand comes to mind (breadth of brand awareness) [53]. To create brand equity, it is also
important that the brand has strong, favorable, and unique brand associations [22]. Brand association
is another component of brand equity linked to consumers’ memory of a brand [54], which provides
the basis of purchase decision-making [55]. Favorable and unique brand associations are essential
to brand image [56]; therefore, when examining brand association, many studies focus on brand

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

4 of 22

image (e.g., [49,57]). Overall, positive brand association and significant brand awareness contribute to
a positive consumer response [19].
Empirical studies have demonstrated that the higher the brand equity, the greater the
loyalty [16–18]. A brand is likely to have positive brand equity if it receives more favorable responses,
that is, higher levels of brand association, awareness, preference, and familiarity [55]. The role of the
brand in creating preferences and generating value and loyalty is no doubt of interest to managers
of cultural institutions [49]. Indeed, most of their marketing efforts are directed toward sustaining
and increasing loyalty [15]. Research shows that when a museum’s brand is evaluated positively,
customer loyalty toward the museum is greater [25]. Although CBBE has been widely discussed
in tourism research [25,52,58], there has been little application of this approach to urban cultural
heritage organizations, with only a few researchers investigating CBBE in the museum [24,25] and
art contexts [49] and even fewer focusing on mixed reality in urban cultural heritage attractions from
this perspective.
3. Hypotheses
In this section, we present our hypotheses. Figure 1 shows our theoretical model, which represents
the characteristics of mixed reality affecting visitor satisfaction via perceived immersion and perceived
enjoyment and the associated hypotheses. Based on brand equity theory, we also posit that the
characteristics of mixed reality affect brand awareness, and in turn, brand awareness influences brand
association and brand loyalty.

Figure 1. Research model.

3.1. Interactivity, Perceived Immersion, Perceived Enjoyment, and Brand Awareness
Interactivity refers to the degree to which users of a medium can influence the form or content
of the mediated environment [59]. Some research suggests that interactivity can have an impact
on the personal experience of the user [59]. User experience consists of perceived immersion and
perceived enjoyment. Interactive games are perceived to be immersive when they offer predictable,
tightly scripted interactions that enable the user to enjoy the virtual experience [60]. Early research
indicates that interactive components, multisensory stimulation, and dynamic displays influence
immersion and are salient and important design features that distinguish one area from another in
the mind of the visitor [61]. Later, Shafer et al. [62] found that perceived reality influenced predicted
spatial presence, which in turn was a significant predictor of enjoyment. Overall, a more immersive,
realistic, and fun experience can be achieved through a more natural user interface [62].

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

5 of 22

Previous research also suggests a positive relationship between interactivity and perceived
enjoyment [62–64]. For instance, in Lin and Parker’s [63] study, interactivity was considered the
most profound way to enhance the user experience in terms of increased presence and enjoyment
in virtual environments. In the context of motion-based systems (e.g., Kinect), Shafer et al. [62]
found similar results: higher interactivity increased spatial presence, perceived reality, and enjoyment.
Interactivity in artistic spaces has also been found to increase audience enjoyment and creative
identity [64]. Finally, Shin [65] proposed a model of attitudes towards 3DTV, identifying significant
roles for social presence and flow, both of which affect attitude, perceived usefulness, and perceived
enjoyment. Accordingly, these factors are considered to underlie users’ expectations of 3DTV [65].
When evaluated as characteristics of an online brand community, both virtual interactivity
and information quality were found to have strong effects on customer engagement [66].
Customer engagement is a strong predictor of brand loyalty. As a result, many organizations
are developing brand communities to promote and communicate their offerings to customers [66].
Recent research demonstrated that the more actively firms use and manage social media, the higher
awareness of the brand will be [67]. Moreover, Mauroner et al. [68] found that interactivity has
a significant influence on brand recall, suggesting that interaction with an ad may lead to more intense
cognitive processing of the brand message. Hence, we hypothesize the following:
H1-1: Interactivity of mixed reality will have a positive effect on perceived immersion.
H1-2: Interactivity of mixed reality will have a positive effect on perceived enjoyment.
H1-3: Interactivity of mixed reality will have a positive effect on brand awareness.
3.2. Vividness, Perceived Immersion, Perceived Enjoyment, and Brand Awareness
Vividness, also known as realness, realism, or richness [69,70], refers to the ability of a technology
to produce a sensorially rich, mediated environment ([39] p. 80). It includes not only the sensory
experience of actual objects, but also the non-sensory experience of imaginary objects [71]. Vividness is
also perceived as a quality of brand expression rather than a quality of the brand itself. For example,
in e-commerce, it is known that how a product is displayed on the web affects evaluation and sales of
that product [72].
Vividness has a positive effect on immersion in the VR context [42]. To feel immersed,
consumers must be free to interact with products, to inspect vividly and realistically generated
virtual product images [73]. This relationship between vividness and immersion is likely also to
be present in mixed reality, where virtual objects appear as a vivid and seamless part of the actual
physical scene.
On the other hand, vividness may also have a positive effect on the enjoyment of mixed reality [74].
In VR, vividness is recognized as a representative form of modality richness, which is known to have
a significant effect on shopping enjoyment [75]. When it comes to e-commerce, the visual vividness of
online websites is associated with enjoyment [76]. Similarly, McLean and Wilson [77] suggested that
perceived enjoyment obtained from technology is related to two functional elements: interactivity and
vividness. We believe this will also be true in the mixed reality context.
According to earlier research, extrinsic cues of website vividness allow unfamiliar brands to
compete against familiar brands [78]. Highly vivid advertisements have been found to influence positive
brand attitudes compared with less vivid advertisements, which in turn stimulates consumers’ purchase
intentions [75]. Additionally, a positive correlation has been demonstrated between the vividness
of word of mouth communication messages and both brand awareness and brand association [62].
Therefore, we present the next hypothesis as follows:
H2-1: Vividness of mixed reality will have a positive effect on perceived immersion.
H2-2: Vividness of mixed reality will have a positive effect on perceived enjoyment.

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

H2-3: Vividness of mixed reality will have a positive effect on brand awareness.
3.3. Perceived Immersion, User Satisfaction, and Brand Association
Perceived immersion refers to the degree to which a person is immersed in the content being
experienced [61,79]. Immersion is an important factor in game experience. Denisova and Cairns [80]
found that the difference between an adaptive AI group and a standard AI group at the level of
the user reflects the specific state in which game users experience immersion. Immersion, passion,
and activation are key elements of consumer brand engagement that represent the degree to which
a customer is prepared to exert relative cognitive, emotional, and behavioral resources in specific
interactions with a focal brand [81]. Highly immersive environments that reproduce perceptual
richness, thus heightening the sense of presence, have positive effects on self-endorsement [82].
Self-endorsement subsequently triggers favorable attitudes toward products and brands. Prior
research suggests that users wearing a particular brand of clothing in a highly immersive environment
prefer the brand worn by their virtual self to the brand worn by others [83].
High sensory immersion is also associated with a more favorable brand attitude, greater product
knowledge, and elevated purchase intention [83]. In the context of 3D virtual worlds, presence was
found to influence enjoyment and brand equity, which is consistent with the theory of flow, which states
that a sense of immersion can produce hedonic outcomes and influence learning and attitudes [19].
Even when AR technology is applied to a game, perceived immersion affects the satisfaction of game
participants [84]. In addition, perceived immersion has a positive effect on satisfaction in a merchant
virtual universe, which hyper-realistically reproduces the environment of a real shopping mall [85].
Likewise, perceived immersion affects satisfaction with experience. We surmise that the same results
may be possible in the context of mixed reality experiences. Therefore, we state the next hypothesis
as follows:
H3-1: Perceived immersion in mixed reality experiences will have a positive effect on user satisfaction.
H3-2: Perceived immersion in mixed reality will have a positive effect on brand association.
3.4. Perceived Enjoyment, User Satisfaction, and Brand Association
In the user experience domain, researchers either focus on one or two factors (e.g., previous
experience or interactivity, involvement and vividness, intention or presence, enjoyment and simulator
sickness) (e.g., [66,75,86]). For instance, Islam and Rahman [66] investigated how the unique
characteristics of a brand community, including information quality, system quality, virtual interactivity,
and rewards, affect customer engagement and, subsequently, brand loyalty. Van Kerrebroeck et al. [75]
explored the impact of VR on transformational brand appeals and found an association between this
technology and higher perceptions of vividness and presence than regular 2D video. Finally, Virvilaite
et al. [86] studied the relationship between vividness and usefulness (word of mouth communication
messaging) and four brand equity components (brand association, brand awareness, brand loyalty,
and perceived quality) and found an overall positive effect.
Perceived enjoyment refers to the degree to which visitors who experience mixed reality
content enjoy it [87,88]. According to the expectation-confirmation model of Shiau and Luo [89],
perceived enjoyment has a positive effect on satisfaction. In addition, another study using the
expectation-confirmation model by Joo et al. [90] confirmed that perceived enjoyment has a significant
positive effect on satisfaction and sustained use intention for students using digital textbooks. In another
study on learning outcomes of VR users in education, it was found that the participants’ perceived
enjoyment of the VR experience not only affected perceived learning outcomes, but also that perceived
learning outcomes positively affected satisfaction, perceived learning, and behavioral intention [91].
Prior research has indicated that enjoyment of an advertisement can affect people’s attitude towards the
advertised product [92]. Hence, we conclude that perceived enjoyment is related to attitudes towards
new marketing systems. Recent research supports this assertion that perceived enjoyment positively

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

7 of 22

influences brand attitude [93]. Likewise, in the context of mixed reality experience, perceived enjoyment
may affect satisfaction. Therefore, we present the next hypothesis as follows:
H4-1: Perceived enjoyment of mixed reality content will have a positive impact on user satisfaction.
H4-2: Perceived enjoyment of mixed reality content will have a positive impact on brand association.
3.5. Brand Awareness and Brand Association
Brand awareness is a key determinant of brand equity [20,94–96]. It is defined as an individual’s
ability to recall and recognize a brand [97]. In the context of this study, brand awareness refers to
whether consumers can recall or recognize a brand or simply whether they know about a brand at all [95].
Brand awareness indicates an association in memory about a particular brand [98]; brand awareness
can have either a positive or negative impact on brand association [99]. This is observed in many
brands, including car brands [100]. Therefore, we hypothesize as follows:
H5: Brand awareness of souvenirs in galleries with mixed reality content will have a positive impact on brand
association.
3.6. Brand Association and Brand Loyalty
As previously mentioned, we investigate brand awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty
from the perspective of brand equity theory. The role of brand associations as an important element in
brand equity management has been previously studied [101]. Brand association is closely related to
customers’ memories about a brand [96]. In brand equity theory, brand association is closely related to
the degree of loyalty to a brand felt by customers [102]. This has been observed in several contexts,
including an e-brand study [96]. In our study, brand association refers to everything related to the
brand in consumers’ minds. Brand association can help consumers determine the relevance of both
the parent brand and extended brands [103]. We believe that brand association will affect brand
loyalty in the context of cultural and artistic visitor attractions and mixed reality souvenir shops.
Therefore, we propose the next hypothesis as follows:
H6: Brand association for a souvenir in a gallery with mixed reality content will have a positive impact on brand
loyalty.
3.7. Satisfaction and Brand Loyalty
User satisfaction refers to visitors’ degree of satisfaction with the content they experience [104].
In this study, brand loyalty refers to the customer’s tendency to repurchase a brand, revealed through
purchase behavior or brand sales (e.g., actual purchases observed over time) [105,106]. Research on
user satisfaction and brand loyalty has been conducted in various contexts. For example, it was found
that shopping mall visitor satisfaction has a positive effect on brand loyalty [107], and brand studies
in the hotel and restaurant industries have found that brand experiences are driven by customer
experience and satisfaction and have positive effects on loyalty [108]. However, there are few empirical
studies that examine the effects on user satisfaction and brand loyalty of content display using mixed
reality in the context of cultural and artistic visitor attractions. Similar to shopping and restaurant
experiences, we expect that satisfaction with mixed reality in this context will have a positive impact
on brand loyalty. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:
H7: User satisfaction with mixed reality will have a positive effect on brand loyalty.

4. Method
4.1. Study Context
For this study, we selected a cultural and artistic visitor attraction located in Seoul in an area where
modern and classical culture and fashion encounter each other and are well balanced. The attraction,
L’atelier, is a representative IT-based theme park which substantially and most successfully adopts
interactive media including mixed reality technologies. Hence, L’atelier can be a good benchmark
to investigate the viability of mixed reality technology for the sustainable operation of the cultural
heritage attraction. L’atelier includes artwork and stories of various 19th-century Impressionist artists
such as van Gogh and Gauguin [109]. It has recently integrated mixed reality technology to provide
an immersive experience using multi-sensory features that contribute to a more interactive and
enjoyable visitor experience. By using this technology, visitors can experience not only paintings but
also hidden stories about various artists and the historical and cultural background relating to the
paintings. Through AI integration, visitors are able to interact via conversation with friends of the
impressionists such as van Gogh’s friend, postman Joseph Roulin. They can also experience artwork
through a media art show on the theme of "Monet’s Garden” (e.g. visit 360 degrees, and models
such as trees in the actual garden appear), which was facilitated by a physical display wall used to
portray holograms and projection mapping technology. Monet depicted the water lily that changes
with light; hence, the artist’s garden in the media art show is the painting created by light. There is also
a hologram talk show based on the mystery around the death of van Gogh and a musical performance,
“van Gogh’s Dream”, which is based on his life story [109]. In the musicals, actors and characters in
digital works interact with real actors through dialogue.
4.2. Measures
A survey with a total of 25 measurement items was used for this study. The following items were
adopted from the literature: interactivity (e.g., “When I experienced Monet’s garden, the mixed reality
water lily leaves interacted with my movement.”) [110], vividness (e.g., “When I experienced a musical,
the digital characters felt vivid.”) [111,112], perceived immersion (e.g., “While I was experiencing the
mixed reality content such as a musical and Monet’s garden, I was immersed in the mixed reality
experience.”) [84,113,114], perceived enjoyment (e.g., “I enjoyed my experience of mixed reality such
as the musicals and Monet’s garden.”) [115,116], brand awareness (e.g., “When I went to L’atelier
souvenir shop, I noticed a souvenir that reflects impressionist artwork.”) [117], brand association
(e.g., “When I looked at impressionist souvenirs, I could easily recall my mixed reality experience at
L’atelier.”) [118,119], satisfaction (e.g., “I am satisfied with the mixed reality content I experienced
at L’atelier.”) [120,121], and brand loyalty (e.g., “I am willing to purchase souvenirs from L’atelier
souvenir shop.”) [120,122]. The other items were identified through factor and reliability analyses and
scored on a 7-point Likert scale. In order to avoid any material discrepancies in the survey, the initial
questionnaire was created in English and then translated to Korean by researchers who are proficient
in both languages.
4.3. Data Collection
For data collection, survey responses were gathered using a tablet PC. The researchers were
situated in the café within the attraction on weekends between 21 and 29 September 2019, and survey
data were gathered from visitors after they experienced mixed reality at the attraction. A total of six
researchers were conducting survey data collection during this time. A stratified sampling method
was used for data collection in order to match the demographic profiles (i.e., age and gender) of
actual visitors to this cultural and artistic visitor attraction. More specifically, in order to identify the
population and profile of visitors, researchers consulted with the marketing manager at the visitor and
artistic cultural attraction in Korea. According to data gathered between November 2017 and October
2019, the majority of visitors to L’atelier are female (66% female, 33% male) aged between 20 and

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

9 of 22

30 years (86.7%), followed by those aged over 40 (13.3%). This was also proven during the pilot study.
Based on this, sample data were collected by researchers using a stratified sampling method to match
the population of actual visitors in terms of gender and age. Respondents experienced the attraction
for one or more hours before visiting the souvenir shop. Each visitor was approached and invited
to participate in the study at the end of their experience. Only those who volunteered to participate
were included.
Data collection was conducted on weekends with an aim to gather an even number of respondents
with regards to age and sex. The age range was limited to adults who were able to purchase their own
entrance tickets. Visitors who had not fully experienced mixed reality during their visit were excluded
from the survey. In order to recruit participants, one researcher wearing a uniform promoted the
survey at the entrance while other researchers conducted the survey with visitors at the café near the
exit. The researcher had a tablet PC dedicated to the questionnaire and the survey was conducted in
the café. All participants were offered a gift box worth about USD 5 as compensation for participation.
In total, 322 surveys were collected, of which 251 were used in the final analysis; others were excluded
due to inappropriate answers to the reverse-coded questions. Each participant spent approximately
10 min completing the survey. SPSS 23.0 was used for demographic analysis and exploratory factor
and reliability analyses. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the participants, which were
collected at the exit of the attraction using a stratified sampling method.

5. Results
Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses
depicted in Figure 1. PLS-SEM was selected as it is designed to evaluate how well a proposed model
or hypothetical construct explains the collected data. It is conducted using a two-step hybrid method,
specifying a measurement model through confirmatory factor analysis, and then testing a latent
structural model developed from the measurement model.
5.1. Factor Analysis
To create the questionnaire, 25 items were analyzed by exploratory factor analysis and the Varimax
rotation method. The factor analysis (shown in Appendix A) revealed that commonality exceeded

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

10 of 22

0.683, and factor loadings revealed eight factors, with no multiple loading items for only one factor of
0.6 or more. The results of the exploratory factor analysis also revealed that the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin
(KMO) value for the sample was 0.905, which confirms that the dataset is valid for the purposes of
factor analysis. In addition, the sphere formation test value for the sample was x2 = 8022.512 (df = 300,
p < 0.001), and the cumulative total variance of the factors was 90.39%, which also indicates suitability
for factor analysis. Reliability of the eight identified factors was confirmed by Cronbach’s α coefficient,
which was higher than 0.832, thus indicating high credibility [123].
5.2. Validation
Validity and feasibility of the measurement model
The validity and appropriateness of the measurement model were determined before testing the
hypotheses of this study. First, as shown in Table 2, the average variance extracted (AVE) exceeded 0.888,
which indicates convergent validity [124]. Composite reliability (CR), which is an index that measures
the feasibility of the measurement model, exceeds 0.900, indicating reliability. The Cronbach’s α
value resulting from the PLS algorithm was 0.833. Except for vividness, the internal consistency of
questionnaire items was indicated by a high reliability value of 0.9 or higher on all other factors [124,125].
Furthermore, the communality value, measuring the quality of the measurement model, exceeded 0.888,
indicating the suitability of the measurement model. The size of goodness-of-fit in the PLS path
model is also regarded as large if the value is 0.36 or larger; the value for location-based AR was 0.536,
thus showing high goodness-of-fit [126].

AVE: average variance extracted, CR: composite reliability; MR: model fit.

In order to ensure discriminant validity, the square root of AVE for each factor should be greater
than the correlation coefficients between variables [127,128]. The results in Table 3 show that the model
satisfies this condition. In addition, the cross-loading results in Appendix B show that all factor loading
values exceeded 0.855, confirming the discriminant validity of each factor.

5.3. Hypothesis Testing
The hypotheses in this study were tested through path counting, and the valence of each path
coefficient was confirmed by setting 5000 bootstrapping specimens [128,129]. The significance of
individual paths is summarized in Figure 2. Thirteen out of thirteen paths exhibited a p-value less
than 0.05. The explanatory power of the research model is also shown. The adjusted R-squared value
shows that the constructs in the model together accounted for 60.5% of user satisfaction with their
experience of mixed reality.

Figure 2. Hypothesis test results.

The results of hypothesis testing were as follows. First, values for interactivity during the mixed
reality-based experience were significantly associated with perceived immersion (β = 0.320, t = 5.222;
H1-1 was supported), perceived enjoyment (β = 0.235, t = 4.049; H1-2 was supported), and brand
awareness (β = 0.240, t = 3.447; H6-3 was supported). Second, values for vividness during the mixed
reality-based experience were significantly associated with perceived immersion (β = 0.330, t = 5.264;
H2-1 was supported), perceived enjoyment (β = 0.395, t = 6.346; H2-2 was supported), and brand
awareness (β = 0.246, t = 3.364; H2-3 was supported). Fourth, users’ perceived enjoyment when
engaging in the mixed reality-based experience was significantly associated with satisfaction (β = 0.535,
t = 5.965; H4-1 was supported) and brand association (β = 0.195, t = 2.936; H4-2 was supported).
Fifth, the users’ perceived immersion when engaging in the mixed reality-based experience was
significantly associated with satisfaction (β = 0.324, t = 3.614; H3-1 was supported) and brand association
(β = 0.337, t = 4.394; H3-2 was supported). Sixth, brand association was significantly associated with
brand loyalty (β = 0.218, t = 2.654; H6 was supported). Third, brand awareness was significantly
associated with brand association (β = 0.162, t = 2.275; H5 was supported). Seventh, satisfaction was

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

12 of 22

significantly associated with brand loyalty (β = 0.349, t = 4.838; H7 was supported). This means that
satisfaction with the mixed reality experience has a positive effect on brand loyalty. Table 4 shows all
path coefficients and hypotheses test results.

6. Discussions
The aim of this study was twofold. The first aim was to investigate how the characteristics of mixed
reality (interactivity, vividness) affect the affective aspects (perceived immersion, perceived enjoyment)
of the experience and satisfaction of visitors to a mixed reality-based attraction. The second aim
was to examine the effects of characteristics of mixed reality on brand awareness, brand association,
and, eventually, brand loyalty, which is connected to the management of cultural and artistic visitor
attractions. Overall, the findings support our proposed hypotheses. Firstly, the findings show that
satisfaction positively influences brand loyalty, which is consistent with previous satisfaction-related
research suggesting that online shopping malls have a positive influence on brand loyalty [107] and
research on hotel restaurants [108]. The relationship between brand association and brand loyalty
was also confirmed, which provides additional, context-specific evidence for the findings of existing
studies related to luxury fashion brands [130] and behavior indicating brand loyalty [102]. The same
tendencies are evident even in the context of souvenirs and the brand of artistic and cultural attractions
that incorporate mixed reality, at least in the case study described herein.
Consistent with prior marketing [99] and luxury car brand studies [100], brand awareness
was found to have a positive effect on brand association. However, this study’s findings reflect
new brand-related factors in a research model including souvenirs as part of the product brand.
Perceived immersion had a positive effect on satisfaction, which extends the findings of previous

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2956

13 of 22

AR [84] and VR [85] research to the mixed reality context. Previously, perceived immersion was
considered as a factor influencing satisfaction or continuance intention [131]; however, this study’s
unique contribution is to demonstrate the influence of perceived immersion on brand association in the
mixed reality context. This influence suggests that perceived immersion is a key factor in sustaining
experience and affecting satisfaction for those in charge of developing mixed reality experiences.
Additionally, previous research suggests that perceived enjoyment influences satisfaction [90–92],
and this relationship was confirmed in this study focusing on mixed reality. Perceived enjoyment was
also found to influence the souvenir brand association, which may inform designers of experience venues
that management of such exhibitions affects not only the ticket income, but also the souvenir income.
Moreover, studies of interactive games have shown that interactivity has a positive effect
on perceived immersion [60] and that interaction between the player and the game world has
a positive effect on perceived immersion [62]. With mixed reality technology, interactivity also
affects perceived immersion. Therefore, in designing mixed reality experiences, interactivity is
an important factor affecting perceived immersion. In this study, interactivity also had a positive
effect on perceived enjoyment [62–64]. Hence, when developing technologies or content involving
mixed reality, interactivity should be well integrated in order to influence perceived enjoyment
positively. Most previous studies on interactivity observe its influence on satisfaction or continuance
intention [132,133]. The results of this study also demonstrated that interactivity has a positive effect
on brand awareness. For future studies on souvenir purchasing in the field of tourism, it is necessary
to design a research model considering brand awareness.
Similar to prior researchers, we found that vividness influenced perceived immersion [42]
and perceived enjoyment [74,75]. Perceived immersion was positively influenced by vividness in
a study of AR technology in e-commerce [42] and of the learning effect in virtual game worlds [134].
The same relationship was confirmed in our research on the mixed reality technology visitor experience.
Furthermore, another study revealed that vividness, interactivity, and telepresence influenced the flow
experience of sport spectators engaged in a VR experience [135] and that interactivity and vividness
affected consumers’ emotional responses and behaviors in video game situations. This study is the
first to propose a research model including vividness of experience content in tourist attractions and
its effect on brand awareness. Overall, these findings suggest that vividness is an important factor for
perceived immersion and perceived enjoyment and should therefore be considered in the development
of mixed reality content.
7. Conclusions
7.1. Theoretical Contributions
There are several theoretical contributions in the current study. First, we used brand equity theory
to examine factors influencing satisfaction and brand loyalty of mixed reality experiences at cultural
and artistic visitor attractions. Second, looking at characteristics of mixed reality, we suggested that
interactivity and vividness not only affect perceived immersion and perceived enjoyment, but also
positively affect brand awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty. To the best of the authors’
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to employ brand equity theory to examine the effects of
characteristics of mixed reality on these constructs in the context of cultural and artistic attractions.
We also empirically examined how the technical characteristics of mixed reality influence mixed
reality experience (perceived immersion and perceived enjoyment) and visitor satisfaction in the
context of a specific cultural and artistic exhibition. We went beyond the boundary of existing
research, which focuses on development of experimental environments or proof of concept [13].
Finally, this study adds to existing research (e.g., [5,36,136] on the use of immersive technologies
(AR, VR, MR) in cultural heritage organizations, specifically the influence of mixed reality on visitor
experience [47].

7.2. Practical Implications
This study has several interesting practical implications that can be drawn from the findings.
First, the importance of immersion and enjoyment of mixed reality content is emphasized in this study,
which is useful for curators and developers of cultural and artistic attractions. Second, our findings
associated with factors affecting brand awareness, brand association, and brand equity could help
managers of cultural and artistic attractions to develop and create mixed reality content that is closely
linked to brand equity. This indicates that enhancing the visitor experience using new and innovative
technologies, such as mixed reality, could lead to positive outcomes such as increased visitor numbers,
thereby contributing to economic aspects of sustainability, which is particularly important for curators
to develop appropriate mixed reality contents in order to increase brand awareness, brand association,
and brand loyalty (souvenir purchase). Third, when creating content, practitioners could consider
the characteristics of mixed reality highlighted in this study to create immersive visitor experiences.
This study demonstrates that perceived immersion and perceived enjoyment influence satisfaction
strongly; therefore, practitioners should focus on creating mixed reality content that provides immersive
and enjoyable experiences to contribute to the overall sustainability of the cultural and artistic visitor
attraction. Although mixed reality content is being developed, it is not often used in practice. L’atelier is
one of a few real-world examples where such modern technology has been integrated into a cultural
and artistic visitor attraction. With a 17 billion Won investment for its mixed reality exhibition
hall development, it is considered a large-scale production cost requiring continuous management
performance, which serves as a useful example for similar attractions aiming to produce mixed reality
content to enhance the visitor experience. Therefore, rather than only exploring those elements that
visitors are satisfied with, we also aimed to examine the influence on brand loyalty and purchase
intention, which contribute to increased visitor numbers and revenue generation. This is critical from
economic aspects of sustainability as well as for continued operation of cultural heritage attractions.
7.3. Limitations and Future Research
This study also has some limitations that provide avenues for further research. First, although
the sample was sufficient for the purposes of this study and allowed reasonable conclusions to be
drawn, respondents were mostly aged between 20 and 30 years old, which could be considered
a limitation. However, as the data were collected with actual visitors to a specific cultural and artistic
attraction, this demographic could be considered representative of those visitors who are most likely
to use mixed reality technology when visiting this type of attraction. Nevertheless, new studies could
include larger and more representative samples within this context to strengthen the current findings.
Second, different mixed reality experiences were available for visitors to experience; there was no
way of controlling which ones were included in the study. In addition, data were collected at the end
of the experience; thus, we relied on respondents recalling their mixed reality experience after the
fact. Further quantitative data (e.g., eye-tracking) could be gathered from respondents during the
mixed reality experience to provide more accurate responses to specific aspects of the experience and
complement the survey results. Additionally, future research could extend this study’s quantitative
findings by incorporating qualitative measures to obtain in-depth understanding and insight into
visitor perspectives of mixed reality experience in cultural and artistic attractions.
