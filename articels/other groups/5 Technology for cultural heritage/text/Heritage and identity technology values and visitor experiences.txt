ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

This editorial examines the notions of identity, visitor experience, values
and technology in the context of heritage tourism. In particular, in
highlighting the contributions of the special issue, it points out how
important these concepts are within the context of heritage cuisinebased tourism and identity meaning-making in leisure and familyoriented consumption of traditional foods. As well, it focuses on the use
of technology in enhancing the visitor experience and how visitors
identify with heritage places, museum branding as a means of fostering
identity and a sense of belonging and the use of crowdfunding as an
alternative means of heritage funding that can enhance the heritage
identity and facilitate a more democratic way of managing heritage
resources.

Introduction
Nowadays, culture and cultural heritage represent the most important foundation for creating and
maintaining identity, belonging and citizenship values. Di Pietro, Guglielmetti Mugion, and Renzi
(2013, p. 1) suggest that ‘culture plays a fundamental role in human development and in the creation
of identities and habits of individuals, as well as communities’. Heritage and culture, indeed, influence and are affected by the daily life of every community and its people. Moreover, heritage is recognized as being among the most universal resources for tourism (Lee & Chhabra, 2015; Timothy &
Boyd, 2003). According to the Faro Convention of the Council of Europe, the value and potential
of cultural heritage, if well managed, is a key aspect of community development and a factor of
increased quality of life in societies that are in a constant state of evolution (Di Pietro et al., 2013;
Di Pietro, Guglielmetti Mugion, Mattia, & Renzi, 2015). This points to a strong affinity among
the concepts of heritage, culture and identity.
Following the thinking of Tunbridge and Ashworth (1996) and Timothy and Boyd (2003), heritage is what contemporary society inherits and passes on; thus, it does not represent only the past but
also the present use of the past. Adapting and expanding the definition provided by Kotler and Kotler
(2004) to a wider context, cultural heritage may be defined as important assets that depict the character and memory of a community, which provides an understanding of the past and helps face the
present and shape the future. It reflects the idea that the relationship between identity and heritage is
revealed not only with nations, regions and localities but also with individuals, shaping their ‘own
personal, familial or cultural ipseity’ (Timothy & Ron, 2013, p. 100). The use of heritage for tourism
and other purposes can help preserve the past and hand down traditions to future generations,
increase citizens’ awareness and enhance people’s capacity to identify themselves in heritage situations (Breathnach, 2006; Poria, Butler, & Airey, 2003). The use and preservation of heritage have

the potential to generate solidarity, social inclusion and innovation. Several authors have examined
the strong bond among sense of belonging, regional identity and social cohesion and how these influence the development of communities (Fusco Girard, 2008; Taylor & Kneafsey, 2016; Turok & Bailey, 2004), allowing the development of local communities, resulting in ‘positive implications in
terms of increased social capital’ (Attanasi, Casoria, Centorrino, & Urso, 2013, p. 3). Both the management and the consumption of heritage should be based on principles of democracy and inclusion.
As part of a more inclusive and democratized heritage environment, during the last decade, there has
been increasing interest in rediscovering the past and manifestations of identity, generating new
forms of heritage tourism or at least a renewed acknowledgement of existing forms of heritage tourism (Bonn, Joseph-Mathews, Dai, Hayes, & Cave, 2007; Boyd, 2002). Timothy and Boyd (2006, p. 1)
describe the breadth of cultural heritage-based tourism as ‘one of the most notable and widespread
types of tourism and is among the very oldest forms of travel’, which permeates many other forms of
tourism, provides a wide range of visitor attractions and is one of the most encompassing categories
of visitor experiences. Hence, the definition of heritage tourism has evolved from an initial vision
limited to past history (Poria et al., 2003) now to include a wider range of cultural, historical and
natural assets, intangible elements of culture, places, attractions and events (Di Pietro et al., 2015;
Russo & Jansen-Verbeke, 2008). For example, there is now widespread recognition of culinary
tourism as a salient niche sector of heritage tourism (Cohen & Avieli, 2004; Long, 2014; Timothy,
2016; Walter, 2016), just as dark tourism (Hartmann, 2014; Stone, Hartmann, Seaton, Sharpley, &
White, 2018) and pilgrimage (Olsen, 2003; Ron, 2009; Timothy & Boyd, 2006) are recognized as
forms of heritage tourism.
Heritage can educe different meanings and experiences for different people, disseminating cultural values and generating new resources (Gonzalez, 2008; Lee & Chhabra, 2015; Timothy &
Teye, 2009). Heritage tourism can be a tool for integrating people, places, nations, economies and
social traditions (Di Pietro, Guglielmetti Mugion, Renzi, & Toni, 2014; Sepe & Di Trapani, 2010).
Thus, it is necessary to revise in an innovative and more effective way the concepts of culture and
cultural heritage, increasing the understanding of cultural values and identity linked with various
types of cultural heritage. In this way, innovative forms of heritage tourism are manifested (Di Pietro
et al., 2015; Donaire & Galí, 2008; Galí-Espelt, 2012), including creative tourism. Richards (2011,
p. 1225) argues that creative tourism is an outgrowth of cultural tourism ‘at once an adjunct and
an antidote to mass forms of cultural tourism and the serial reproduction of culture’. From the perspective of creative tourism, Taylor and Kneafsey (2016) recognize the importance of cultural festivals in fostering community values and heritage continuity, reinforcing group identities and the
transmission of traditions.
Heritage tourism frequently evokes a sense of elitist consumption that involves only the most
sophisticated and cultured tourists (Timothy & Boyd, 2003). Indeed, a lack of strong cultural knowledge may be one of the main causes of people avoiding heritage experiences (Davis & Prentice, 1995);
yet, there are multitudes of heritage tourism types that appeal to a wide range of markets. Trending
today is the inclusion of many resources and experiences under the label ‘heritage tourism’, including, for instance, culinary traditions. Likewise, implementing innovative ways of experiencing heritage, such as through modern technology, has the potential to attract new visitor segments. This
widening of the traditional cultural visitor base involves increasing customers that unconsciously
become vehicles for transmitting heritage and its associated identities, meanings and values to the
present and future. From this point of view, heritage tourism allows the preservation of local identities that might otherwise disappear (Rogers, 2002; Stronza, 2008; Xue, Kerstetter, & Hunt, 2017).
The implementation of technology in the cultural heritage sphere can reinforce visitor experiences, enhancing both memories and a sense of belonging. As Timothy and Boyd (2003) emphasized, enhancing the memory of one’s heritage visit may contribute to an increased awareness of
the past and translate into the desire to interact with heritage in sustainable ways. Thus, it is crucial
to consider the growing role that technology plays in the cultural sector, technology now being
recognized as one of the essential components of the cultural experience (Di Pietro et al., 2015).

In recent years, innovative and fascinating technological applications within the cultural heritage
sector have emerged. This phenomenon ‘has determined a rapid and substantial change in the practices of utilization, supply, and conservation of cultural heritage’ (Guccio, Martorana, Mazza, &
Rizzo, 2016, p. 55). Di Pietro, Guglielmetti Mugion, Arcese, and Mattia (2017) present a twofold
classification of macro-categories of technology that can be observed within the cultural sector:
online technologies that focus on website use and mobile applications, and on-site technologies,
such as guided tours and devices that enhance the visit (e.g. audio guides, GPS locators and mobile
apps). Many of these technologies have enriched the experience and made information more accessible to different visitor segments. Through new communication technologies, additional information can be shared with visitors, thereby becoming a focal point of added value to the heritage
experience.

Focus of this special issue
This special issue of the Journal of Heritage Tourism (JHT) focuses on how the relationship between
cultural heritage and identity can influence current and future generations, their values and sensibility regarding heritage tourism. More specifically, the articles in this collection explore the relationships among heritage, identity and values, from different and complementary perspectives. In
particular, current and innovative trends affecting the heritage sector and identity are proposed
and discussed: culinary heritage, technological applications, visitor satisfaction and cultural-creative
crowdfunding.
The first article, ‘Heritage cuisine and identity: free time and its relation to the social reproduction
of local food’, by Thomé-Ortiz analyzes the relations among culinary heritage, identity and leisure
time. The paper offers a qualitative examination of recreational and family-oriented consumption
of a traditional cuisine, Barbacoa de Borrego, a traditional food in Texcoco, a small town near Mexico
City. Conserving and transmitting traditional cuisine and foodways with their heritage values
reinforce the identity of specific locales (Bessière,1998; Cusack, 2000; Holtzman, 2006; Pilcher,
1996; Timothy & Ron, 2013). This assertion is clearly brought to bear in the first paper, where
the author shows empirically how food traditions are strongly bonded with the heritage of Texcoco
and become an important family affair that enables the gastronomic heritage of Mexico to be passed
down to future generations. This paper makes clear that the sustainability of Barbacoa de Borrego as
a heritage product depends on the intrinsic knowledge of the traditional cooking process. The author
demonstrates that the real and authentic value of traditional food is determined by the specific place
where it is produced and consumed, confirming the assertion of Folgado-Fernández, HernándezMogollón, and Duarte (2017) and Kivela (2006) that the appeal of gastronomic tourism lies in
the provision of local food experience which demarcates the distinctiveness of a destination and,
therefore, enhances its attractiveness. In terms of both the cooking process and the regional foodrelated identity, Thomé-Ortiz shows that recreational food consumers generally consider traditional
food to be healthier, owing to its linkages to an ancient past and genuine cultural practices. The
author sheds light on the bond that ties together traditional foods and local culture and identity,
emphasizing the role that heritage cuisine plays in cultural tourism.
The article by Solima and Izzo, ‘QR codes in cultural heritage tourism’, introduces the role of new
communication technologies in the cultural heritage sector. The authors present the case of a joint
project between the Royal Palace of Naples (Italy) and the Wilanów Palace in Warsaw (Poland) that
aimed to experiment with an information system based on QR codes. QR codes are a technological
innovation believed to enhance the depth and breadth of visitors’ interaction with heritage, thereby
increasing their learning performance during their visits. These new technologies have the potential
to expand accessibility and information dissemination about collections and exhibits (Cataldo, 2011;
Cataldo & Paraventi, 2007; Hazan, 2011; Izzo, Mustilli, & Guida, 2015; Solima, 2014). The authors
measured the effectiveness of new QR code technology at the sites in Italy and Poland. The study
shows a positive level of visitor satisfaction with the QR technology, emphasizing the contribution

100

L. DI PIETRO ET AL.

of this innovation in augmenting the cultural experience and improving the educational environment. Solima and Izzo shed light on the potential benefits of embedding QR code technology within
museum exhibitions and provide insight into the future implications of technological change.
The third article in this theme issue, ‘National heritage branding: a case study of the Russian
Museum of Ethnography’, by Kovaleva, Epstein and Parik highlights the importance of brand perception as part of museums’ brand management. In this case, the authors examined this concept at
the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg. The paper presents two salient concepts that
underlie the essence of this special issue: the importance of measuring visitors’ perceptions of, and
satisfaction with, cultural heritage, and the role of the museum in creating and maintaining a
regional identity. Ethnographic museums specialize in conserving evidence of human lives and civilization (Di Pietro et al., 2014). Accordingly, these sorts of cultural museums are critical in transmitting national identities to younger generations. According to Kovaleva, Epstein and Parik, the
growing interest in ethnographic and history museums illustrates their leverage in enhancing and
developing a strong sense of place and belonging to a given culture and fostering national solidarity
among diverse populations. Therefore, embracing distinctive museum brand characteristics can help
create clear expectations in the minds of visitors. Improving the image and attractiveness of ethnographic museums helps engender a national or cultural identity and enhance the knowledge of a
people. The study shows a positive correlation between visitors’ satisfaction with the museum in
St. Petersburg and the museum’s importance. The study demonstrates that school and family are
the most important sources of knowledge, highlighting the importance of social networks in
strengthening the power of word-of-mouth. In common with the paper by Solima and Izzo, this
paper confirms the need to introduce new technologies to enhance the museum’s attractiveness
and impact, as well as increase satisfaction, particularly among young visitors.
The final article by Marchegiani, ‘From Mecenatism to crowdfunding’, analyzes crowdfunding for
cultural and creative projects. Current economic crises and the consequent reduction of public funds
for culture and the arts require innovative ways of raising money and investing in culture. As this
editorial and the other papers in this special issue indicate, the increasing competitiveness among
cultural activities, the need to monitor visitors’ expectations and satisfaction, and the growing diffusion of technological applications all amplify the need to find new investment opportunities. Marchegiani utilizes the European Crowdfunding Network’s (2013) definition of crowdfunding as
a collective effort of many individuals who network and pool their resources to support efforts initiated by other
people or organizations … Individual projects and businesses are financed with small contributions from a
large number of individuals, allowing innovators, entrepreneurs and business owners to utilize their social networks to raise capital.

The potential of this phenomenon in the cultural context could be extremely deep and empowered by the presence of factors such as the sharing of cultural meanings and identities. According to
Marchegiani, crowdfunding may instill and spread a sense of heritage identity and democratic participation in supporting, living and remembering cultural experiences. In addition, the diffusion of
cultural crowdfunding initiatives by social media may increase the visibility of cultural-creative projects, enticing new markets and enhancing its ability to convey identity and meaning. This paper
investigates clusters of potential cultural crowdfunders and identifies viable funding mechanisms
in the context of cultural heritage. The results identify two main clusters of investors: potential technological investors and potential altruistic investors. The author also suggests that the donationbased model of crowdfunding seems to be the most viable, generating a sense of direct contribution
to cultural and creative processes.

Conclusion and future directions
As stated at the beginning of this editorial, the concepts of heritage, culture and identity are closely aligned and strongly influence heritage tourism. The topics of the four articles in this theme

JOURNAL OF HERITAGE TOURISM

101

issue of JHT should be considered different strategic approaches to heritage tourism. They represent important and interesting directions that open the broader discussion about the future
of cultural heritage-based tourism. They represent examples of timely phenomena and trends
that are affecting heritage tourism, generating new opportunities both for scholars and
practitioners.
The analysis of specific forms of heritage tourism, such as culinary tourism, the use of technological applications, the systemic implementation of tools for monitoring and analyzing visitors’
expectations and levels of satisfaction, and the identification of innovative and alternative funding
sources represent strategic avenues for analyzing and ‘feeding’ heritage tourism. While the individual topics presented in this special issue may seem rather disconnected in some ways, they
are in fact only different faces of a singular complex phenomenon. They are connected and intertwined and should be studied in complementary ways. For instance, the availability of funds and
investments can allow the adoption of new technologies, which may in turn attract new visitor
segments and increase their level of satisfaction. Studying these themes actively contributes to
the preservation, valorization and transmission of heritage meanings and identities over time.
Of course, we understand that these contributions represent only a few examples of themes
that require additional research to understand the mechanisms that link together culture, heritage,
identity and tourism. For these reasons, we believe that this special issue and its contents enrich
current understandings about cultural heritage and tourism and pave the way for new ideas to be
generated and further research to be undertaken.
