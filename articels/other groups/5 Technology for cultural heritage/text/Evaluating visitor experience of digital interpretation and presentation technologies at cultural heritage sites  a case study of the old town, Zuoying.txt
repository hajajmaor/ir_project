Evaluating visitor experience of digital
interpretation and presentation
technologies at cultural heritage sites: a
case study of the old town, Zuoying
Ying Liu

Abstract
Digital technologies are increasingly used in the interpretation and presentation process at cultural heritage
sites, shifting the manner of heritage display from previous ways, which tended to be monolithic and static,
to a more diversified, experiential, and interactive approach and enabling new connections between
heritage and the public. Digital experience is gradually becoming an important component of visitors’
heritage experience. However, little attention has been paid to the influence and effects that these
technologies have on the visitor experience, and a corresponding measurement framework for the heritage
digital experience is still lacking. To contribute to the design, implementation, and management of digital
display systems at cultural heritage sites, this research aims to evaluate visitors’ expectations, acceptance,
and experience of digital interpretation and presentation technologies. A mixed methodology, combining
questionnaires based on a digital experience evaluation framework and semi-structured interviews, was adopted and
used in Old Zuoying City (OZC), a typical heritage site for the application of digital display technologies in Taiwan. Our
study indicates that digital display technologies received high acceptance from heritage visitors and had a positive
impact on some specific aspects, such as encouraging their exploration of and further learning about the site, helping
them better visualize the richness of heritage, and creating new experiences of perceiving, engaging, and
communicating with history. In addition, based on the survey findings, a number of recommendations for the current
stage of digital display design are presented. The survey results and evaluation framework can be used as a reference
for other research on heritage visitors and to improve digital interpretation and presentation design.

Introduction
Heritage conservation is essentially ‘a communication
act’ (ICOMOS 2008), that is, the inheritance and
transmission of heritage value. Therefore, as an activity aimed at raising public awareness and improving
the public’s understanding of cultural heritage sites
(interpretation) and the planned dissemination of

heritage contents at cultural heritage sites (presentation), the interpretation and presentation of heritage
have always been regarded as one of the critical missions in the national and international protection of
cultural and natural heritage and as the essential
component in the process of heritage conservation
(UNESCO 1972; ICOMOS 2002; 2008). By communicating to people the significance and connotation of
cultural heritage through the organization of ‘potential
activities’, ‘interpretive information’, ‘physical access’,
and ‘interpretive infrastructure’ at cultural heritage

sites (Guo 2009; ICOMOS 2008), interpretative and
presentative activities convey cultural values and cultural identities, enhancing visitors’ understanding of,
enjoyment of and positive attitudes towards heritage
sites (Stewart et al. 1998) and stimulating visitors’ further learning, experience, and exploration to ultimately ‘encourage the high level of public awareness
and support necessary for the long-term survival of
the cultural heritage’ (ICOMOS, 2002). Consequently,
planning interpretation and presentation that effectively communicate heritage information and value and
that provide visitors with a positive and valuable experience is becoming a significant mission for cultural
heritage institutions.
The application of various technologies in the
process of cultural presentation and interpretation has
been ongoing for decades (Othman et al. 2011). For
instance, the first use of voice-guided navigation technology in cultural spaces dates back to 1952, when
the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam provided historical background and exhibition content to visitors
through handheld guides (Tallon 2008). Similarly, numerous international cultural heritage protection documents emphasize the importance of technology
integration in heritage interpretation and presentation
at different levels. For example, the 1972 UNESCO
Convention indicates that presentation work should
keep abreast of advances in ‘communication, audiovisual techniques, automatic data-processing, and
other appropriate technology, and cultural and recreational trends’ and suggests that ‘all media of information should be employed as required’ during the
heritage display process (UNESCO 1972).
Since the 1990s, digital technologies have been widely
used in the context of cultural heritage (He et al. 2017),
becoming strong supports in heritage interpretation and
presentation. In particular, the incorporation of Reality
Creation Technologies,1 such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), which provide diversified content formats (video, 3D-animation,
multimedia, etc.) and abundant methods of interaction
(voice interaction, touch-screen interaction, gamified operation, etc.), have shifted the form of heritage display
from previous forms, which were supported only
through printed images, textual descriptions or other
limited static settings, enhancing the authenticity, experience and interactivity of presentations (Kong and
Rong 2017) and enabling new interactions and connections between heritage and the public (Liu 2018).

In the 2018 Digital Heritage International Congress, UNESCO
summarized three groups of digital technology related to digital
heritage: Reality Capture (digitization, scanning, remote sensing, etc.),
Reality Computing (databases & repositories, KM, GIS, etc.), and
Reality Creation (VR, AR, MR, games, multimedia, 3D printing, etc.).

Importantly, in the context of the increasing application of digital technologies in heritage interpretation
and presentation, the use of digital technologies
should not just be considered ‘an informationdistribution platform’ (Wasserman 2011) or an alternative to traditional means of heritage information
presentation. Instead, according to Othman et al.
(2011), such technologies should be considered ‘further ways to connect and engage visitors with objects,
collections, and exhibits’. Accordingly, what influence
and effects these technologies have on visitors is an
issue requiring further discussion. Although digital
technologies continue to create new opportunities and
possibilities for heritage display, it could also negatively impact heritage communication and interfere
with the visitor experience if they are not carefully
developed and applied. Consequently, it is important
to gain a holistic understanding of visitors’ acceptance, experience, and expectations of digital interpretation and presentation to improve digital display
design at heritage sites and to develop sustained visitor/heritage site relationships.
However, although research on digital heritage is
on the rise, most recent studies have focused almost
exclusively on digital documentation and information
management (He et al. 2017). A few digital
presentation-related papers, such as Wang et al.
(2006) paper about the structure and working principles of the immersive outdoor AR system in Yuanming Garden, and Gleue and Dähne’s (2001) paper
about the design and implementation process for an
outdoor mobile device for ancient Olympia in
Greece, mainly explore the planning and implementation of digital display technologies in cultural heritage sites from design or technical perspectives
through case studies. Far too little attention has
been paid to the impact of digital interpretative
technologies on the visitor experience. Moreover,
while prior visitor studies in the cultural heritage
site domain have conducted a certain amount of research on the visitor experience, with such research
providing the essential theoretical underpinning of
this study, there has been little specific research focusing on the role of digital display technologies in
enhancing the heritage visitor experience. Furthermore, regarding the evaluation model or framework,
there is still a lack of specific guidelines and scales
for cultural heritage sites to evaluate the on-site visitor experience in contexts of digital display technologies (Pallud and Monod 2010).
Therefore, to contribute to the design, implementation, and management of digital interpretation and presentation at cultural heritage sites, this research aims to
develop measures based on previous studies to quantify

Liu Built Heritage

the influence that digital display technologies have on
heritage visitors to gain in-depth insights into visitors’
experience and response to using interpretative and presentative technologies.

The evaluation of the visitor heritage experience
As the visitor experience is increasingly recognized as a
core product of heritage site offerings (Packer and Ballantyne 2016), researchers from different disciplines have
conducted extensive research on the heritage visitor experience, identifying visitors’ key expectations (knowledge gains, education, participation, entertainment,
active involvement, engagement, etc.) of a heritage
attraction (Masberg and Silverman 1996; De Rojas and
Camarero 2008; Pine and Gilmore 1999; Hughes and
Benn 1995) and summarizing some critical influences
(audio and visual communication; atmospherics; on-site
engagement; information, etc.) on visitor heritage experience (Kempiak et al. 2017). Such research provides
the essential theoretical underpinning of this study.
Notably, however, these studies do not explicitly discuss the role of technologies in the heritage context.
On the other hand, there has been a small amount of
research that includes surveys on visitors’ experience of
digital technologies. For instance, ‘interactive and digital
media’ were set as one of the survey scales in Kempiak
et al.’s investigation (Kempiak et al. 2017) of the visitor
experience at a heritage attraction in Northern Ireland,
and according to their results, interactive and digital
media were ‘vital forms of communication of heritage
content and play a major role in visitor experience’.
While some of these studies have addressed visitors’ legacy digital experiences, most of them have emerged only
as a very small facet of visitor heritage experience research, and an in-depth and comprehensive discussion is
lacking.
Additionally, regarding the evaluation framework,
there is still a lack of specific guidelines for measuring the visitor heritage experience, particularly in the
context of digital display technology use (Pallud and
Monod 2010). As such a framework involves the
evaluation of visitors’ digital experience, it seems that
some frameworks from the field of digital product design regarding user experience (UX) research can be
adopted to fill this gap. As a discipline that emphasizes user-centredness, UX evaluation is an important
research component in the digital product design domain, and some systematic UX evaluation concepts
and standards for product usability tests have been
developed. For instance, Norman (2005) proposed
three levels (visceral, behavioural, and reflective) of
product design from the user psychological perspective and emphasized that these three levels were interrelated and together constituted the overall UX of

Page 3 of 15

the product. On the other hand, Hartson and Pyla
(2012) took more of a digital design perspective, emphasizing that ease-of-use and learnability were very
important in and fundamental to most digital products and that users could not derive joy from using a
digital product that was very awkward to use. Accordingly, they argued that the scope of UX evaluation
should include the dimensions of usability, usefulness,
and emotional impact. These studies provide informative frameworks for assessing visitors’ heritage digital
experiences, but they do not address the context of
cultural heritage.
Therefore, conducting a follow-up survey, this study
develops an evaluation framework of the visitor digital
experience (Fig. 2) with reference to the abovementioned criteria related to UX testing, and it establishes
specific measurement dimensions regarding the objectives of heritage site interpretation and presentation
as well as visitors’ heritage expectations. The framework is then used in this research to evaluate the
digital experience of heritage visitors in an actual
venue.

Methodology
This study was designed to investigate the impact of
digital interpretation and presentation at cultural heritage sites on the visitor experience. Therefore, to gain a
detailed understanding of the issues raised, this study
employed a field study methodology in which a selfadministered questionnaire was used as the main research method to gather quantitative data on visitors’
experiences, with the support of interviews to obtain further in-depth information on the specific feedback of
participants.
Research venue

The selected venue in this study, Old Zuoying City
(OZC), is a well-known cultural heritage site located
in Kaohsiung, Taiwan; it was registered as one of the
First-Level Monuments of Taiwan in 1986. As one of
Taiwan’s first stone fortifications built during the
Qing Dynasty, OZC (Fig. 1) is currently the largest
and most well-preserved ancient city in Taiwan and
has a special position among other ancient cities built
during the same period. In addition, according to the
results of archaeological research conducted over the
past two decades, traces of human activity in OZC
and the surrounding areas date back to the Neolithic
period approximately 5000–4000 years ago (Liu 2008).
The unique and profound history and culture of the
prehistoric era, the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the
Dutch period, and the period of Japanese occupation
are interwoven in this area, making OZC an

indispensable and precious cultural heritage bearing
witness to Taiwan’s history.
Moreover, OZC was selected as a significant implementation site in the Regeneration of Historic Site Project, which is a public infrastructure investment project
launched in 2016 by the Taiwan Bureau of Cultural
Heritage to support the revitalization of local cultural assets and resources. The core concept of ‘regeneration’
emphasizes the utilization of diverse media to reproduce
the historical meaning of each site and the use of emerging digital technology to guide people through diverse
historical memories, connecting the current generation
with cultural values (Taiwan Bureau of Cultural Heritage
2016). As a subproject of the Regeneration of Historic
Site Project, OZC Renovation Project is regarded as an
unprecedented large-scale cultural heritage preservation
plan in Kaohsiung City that demonstrates the evolution
of the cultural heritage preservation concept in Taiwan
(Wang et al. 2018). Guided by the project’s vision of
presenting the past to the public by applying innovative experiential methods to combine culture and
technology (Taiwan Bureau of Cultural Heritage
2016), OZC utilizes digital technologies to present its
history to visitors, to evoke the public’s memory of
the historical site, and to promote the public’s recognition of the value of cultural heritage (Wang et al.
2018). The whole interpretation and presentation system in OZC includes eight areas, six of which are integrated with digital technologies (see Table 5 in
Appendix 1), such as AR, VR, moving models and

projection mapping, offering diverse media content,
such as audio and video. Consequently, historical and
cultural display system in OZC operates not through
cultural relics or other static presentations but primarily through digital technologies and dynamic content. Accordingly, OZC is an excellent setting for
evaluating and determining the effects that digital display technologies have on the visitor experience in
cultural heritage sites.
Survey design

The overall structure of the survey took the form of
three phases (Fig. 2). First, site investigations and interviews with OZC employees were conducted to gather information about the setting of the digital display system
at OZC and visitors’ reactions during their visits and
their interactions with the digital interpretation and
presentation settings to ensure the relevance of the
questionnaire design before conducting the next phase
of the investigation.
In the second phase, an evaluation framework of
the visitor digital experience was created based on the
abovementioned research related to the assessment of
the visitor heritage experience and the UX testing of
digital products. Guided by the framework, a threesection questionnaire with both close-ended and
open-ended questions was developed and used to
gather quantitative data from visitors during the previsitation, on-site visitation, and post-visitation
periods.

Fig. 2 Research framework (Source: the author)

The first section (pre-visitation) of the questionnaire
covered information about the respondents’ experience
of digital technologies, their prior knowledge of OZC,
and their motivations for and expectations of their visit.
The second section (on-site visitation) of the questionnaire (see Table 6 in Appendix 2), which was
the key part of this survey, was designed to measure
the respondents’ experience of digital interpretation
and presentation technologies during their visit.
Since OZC offers several types of digital technologies, this section surveys the equipment globally. Information on visitors’ experience of different specific
technologies was gathered in this section of the
questionnaire. Guided by Norman’s (2005) theory of
the three levels of user cognitive experience, the second section of the questionnaire was divided into

three parts: the first part focused on the visceral
level of the respondents’ experience, gathering their
first impressions of the digital display system; the
second part investigated the behavioural level of the
respondents’ experience during their visit, addressing
four key areas (usability, information/knowledge, entertainment, and engagement) through items that integrate the influence of both the digital product UX
and the heritage visitor experience; the third part examined the reflective level of the respondents’ experience to gain a further understanding of the influence
that the digital interpretation and presentation system has on visitors. A five-point Likert scale ranging
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) was
employed for each question to measure the items
above.

The final section (post-visitation) aimed to gather visitors’ overall evaluations of and satisfaction with the digital
interpretation and presentation system, their gains from
the visit, and their recommendations for digital display design at OZC and other cultural heritage sites.
As a supplement to quantitative data on the visitor experience, post-questionnaire interviews were conducted
with respondents who wanted to share further information. Through a semi-structured interview, the researchers
aimed to gain further insights into the reasons for the different choices and evaluations made by the questionnaire
respondents and to gather their specific comments and
suggestions on the form, content, interaction mode and
other aspects of digital interpretation and presentation.
The collected quantitative and qualitative data were
computerized and further analysed using SPSS and
NVivo, respectively.

The descriptive statistics also indicate that over 87% of
the visitors who participated in this study had experience
visiting cultural heritage sites. Most of them had visited 1–
5 different sites (59.3%), followed by more than 10 (17.3%)
and 6–10 (11.1%). With regard to the respondents’ experience using on-site cultural display settings, the study
showed that the figures for information boards (67.6%), literature and historical text (60.6%), simulation items and
models (60.6%), and multimedia (62%) tend to be fairly
similar; thus, they are the four types of cultural display settings most frequently used by respondents who had visited
cultural heritage sites before. The proportion of participants
who used navigation (31%) was slightly higher than the proportion of participants who used digital interactive applications (22.5%) or other settings (22.5%).

Data generation

Surprisingly, according to the participants, the main expectation of OZC visitors was to experience different digital display technologies at the site (32.6%); this result, was even
slightly higher than the expectation to learn more about the
history and culture of the heritage (30.8%). The prior interviews with employees at the site and the post-questionnaire
interviews with visitors show that the major reasons for this
result are closely related to the digital display technologyfocused marketing strategy launched by OZC and the online
and offline promotion content (YouTube videos, Facebook
posts or paper flyers) received by the public. To some extent,
this result also reflected the attractiveness of cultural heritage
digital interpretation and presentation to visitors. Furthermore, the survey revealed that over three-fourths of the sample knew nothing (12.3%) or had extremely limited
knowledge (77.8%) about the site, thus indicating an area for
improvement. Additionally, over 70% of those surveyed indicated that they were unfamiliar with AR/VR or other digital
technologies, and nearly 10% had never used any of the
above equipment or technologies.

The survey was conducted at OZC from June to July 2019
on both weekdays and weekends. To ensure the maximum
number of respondents, the researcher was positioned at
the entrance of OZC, where visitors need to return rented
AR devices before leaving the site. As two out of the eight
display areas in the site do not use digital technologies, the
survey questionnaires were distributed to only visitors who
experienced the digital interpretation and presentation settings to guarantee the validity of the collected data. All the
questionnaires and follow-up interviews were completed on
site by the respondents immediately after they finished their
visit. Over 90 took part in the survey, with an average questionnaire completion time of 15 min. In addition, a total of
41 short follow-up interviews (ranging from 10 min to 40
min) were conducted with questionnaire participants who
were willing to share further information regarding their
interaction with digital technologies.

Findings
After deleting unusable questions with too many unanswered questions, a total of 81 valid responses constituted the final sample of this study. The descriptive
statistics of the respondents were coded and computed
in SPSS (v26) for analysis.
Respondent details

As shown in Table 1, female visitors (63.4%) represented a
larger proportion of the survey respondents than male visitors
(34.6%). The age of the respondents ranged from 13 to 70
years, and the majority (75.5%) of visitors were within 13–20
(37%) and 21–30 (38.5%) age groups. Regarding fields of
interest, history (51.6%), culture (64.2%), architecture
(50.6%), and cultural heritage (50.6%) received relatively
high ratings from the participants, followed by art (37%)
and three digital technology-related options (23.5%).

Pre-visit expectations and prior knowledge of the site and
digital technologies

Experience of digital interpretation and presentation
during the visit

In this section of the questionnaire, the participants were
asked to indicate their experience of digital display technologies using a Likert scale. Their responses were analysed in
SPSS (v26) to measure the scales of experience at three
levels. Before proceeding with further analysis, the data were
checked for internal reliability using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Except for usability, which had a Cronbach’s alpha
(0.698) slightly lower than 0.70 (Table 3), the other survey results (ranging from 0.788 to 0.960) were above the recommended values, indicating a relatively high level of reliability.
According to Nunnally and Bernstein (1994), 0.6 is acceptable for exploratory investigations; thus, all of the scores for
each scale were adopted in this study.

Visceral-level experience

Regarding their first impressions of the digital interpretation and presentation at the site (Table 2), the
majority (85.2%) of the sample indicated that they
were satisfied (55.6%) and perfectly satisfied (29.6%)
with the way history and culture were presented,
while only 2.2% reported that the digital display technologies were unacceptable. The results also revealed
that most of the respondents were willing (55.6%) and
very willing (28.45%) to operate the different settings
themselves to discover the history of OZC. Visitors
are motivated to interact with the digital settings at
heritage sites.
Moreover, one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there were any age differences in the variables with regard to visceral-level experience. The test
revealed significant age differences in the respondents’
first impressions of digital interpretation and presentation at the site (F = 8.356, p < 0.001) as well as the presentation of cultural heritage and the willingness to learn
about history through self-operated digital devices (F =

7.123, p < 0.001). The respondents in the 21–30 age
group appeared to have the best first impressions of the
digital display technologies at the site (mean = 4.59) and
were the most willing to operate the various digital devices (4.59), closely followed by the visitors in their 30s
(mean = 4.57 & 4.43); on the other hand, the participants
in their 60s had a relatively low acceptance of digital displays (mean = 3.00 & 3.33).
Behavioural-level experience

As shown in Table 3, the overall satisfaction with
behavioural-level experience appeared to be high, as the
average score for every factor was higher than the mean
score of 3.00.
Unexpectedly, usability resulted in the lowest value
(mean = 3.543) among all the factors. This finding indicates limited user satisfaction with the basic performance of digital display devices, such as learnability
and operability. Specifically, only 7.4% of the respondents strongly agreed that they could complete the
various operations of the devices without guidance

from staff, and 16% of the visitors agreed with this assertion. Employees play a crucial role in directing visitors how to use digital devices. Similarly, the results
show that nearly half (53.1%) of the users could not
determine how to operate different devices within a
short period of time. This result may be related to the
fact that most of the digital devices at OZC are more
recent technologies such as AR and VR; moreover, this
result is associated with the respondents’ prior experience with digital products (more than 70% of the sample had never used similar devices before visiting
OZC).
Regarding information & knowledge, the contribution of digital technologies in reliving historical
scenes and presenting historical information was
largely recognized by the visitors, with mean scores
of 4.27 and 4.21, respectively. Additionally, 35.8% of
the respondents strongly agreed that digital technologies allowed them to understand the history of

OZC in a more dynamic way, and 50.6% agreed with
the above statement, suggesting that digital display
technologies play an effective role in the dissemination of heritage content. They also considered the
digital presentation and interpretation to be intuitive
and impressive. On the other hand, the results show
that the visitors were not entirely satisfied with the
clarity of the historical content presented by technologies (mean = 3.9), which is the most basic requirement that should be met.
The entertainment factor was rated as the best experience provided by the digital display technologies.
The display design of OZC combines the advantages
of digital technologies in terms of gamification and
interactivity, to a certain extent enriching the presentation and form of user participation. For instance,
the Treasure Hunt in the Old City display area combines the presentation of different artefacts with a
scavenger hunt, guiding visitors to find golden coins

(AR content trigger points) using AR devices to obtain dynamic artefact information; moreover, in another display area, Our Old City, visitors can rebuild
the heritage site themselves in virtual 3D space with
VR equipment (Fig. 3). The survey revealed that
46.9% and 42% of the sample agreed and strongly
agreed, respectively, that the way in which history
was presented was entertaining, with only 1.2% of respondents reporting that they took no pleasure, suggesting the significant contribution of digital display
technologies in enhancing the fun of visitors’ experience. The overall interactive process and game design
in the display content also received high ratings from
users.
Finally, the mean score for the engagement factor was
4.007, with most (76.5%) of the sample reporting that
they had an immersive experience of OZC history offered by digital display technologies. In addition, 51.9%
and 27.2% of the visitors agreed and strongly agreed, respectively, with the statement that digital display technologies at OZC contributed to the sense of historical
participation. The results also revealed that digital technologies, at least to a certain extent, increased the respondents’ interest in visiting cultural heritage sites,
given that 74.1% of them were willing to spend time
exploring different digital display areas and 66.7%
would like to repeatedly operate different digital display deceives and watch or experience digital display
content.
Additionally, further one-way ANOVA revealed no
significant age differences for most of the items included
here, suggesting that visitors of different ages shared
similar perceptions of the behavioural-level digital experience. However, differences in age had a greater impact on ENT 1 (F = 4.510, p = 0.01) and ENT 2 (F =
6.069, p < 0.01) for the entertainment factor and ENG1
(F = 8.118, p < 0.01) and ENG 2 (F = 5.378, p < 0.01) for
the engagement factor. Specifically, participants in their
20s had a higher recognition of entertainment both in
the digital display technologies (mean = 4.39) and the
interaction process (mean = 4.61) with digital display settings compared to participants in other age groups, especially those over 60. Similarly, compared to other
participants, those between the ages of 21 and 30

showed higher enthusiasm for exploring different digital
display contents and repeatedly operating digital display
settings.
Reflective-level experience

Regarding the holistic perception of heritage and a
deeper intellectual resonance, the results (Table 4) reveal that the majority (64.2%) of the sample reported
that digital display technologies gave them a comprehensive understanding of the architecture, history, and
culture of the heritage, while 71.6% indicated that
technologies increased their interest in OZC. Additionally, 79.1% of the visitors agreed (55.6%) and
strongly agreed (23.5%) that technologies had furthered their understanding of and reflection on history
and cultural heritage.
Post-visit experience

The content of the open-ended questions and the results of the post-questionnaire interviews relating to
the details on overall satisfaction with digital presentation and interpretation at the site were analysed.
In relation to how visitors described their experience
of digital display technologies, the results reveal that
‘lively’, ‘interesting’, and ‘attractive’ were the three
feelings most frequently mentioned by the respondents. Quite a few interviewees argued that static presentations (i.e., images or text) need to be understood
by themselves, which results in a boring experience,
while the dynamic presentations offered by digital
technologies were ‘more intuitive’, ‘more stimulating’,
‘delicate and vivid’, making it ‘easier for us to understand historical events’. One individual stated that
‘Through moving pictures and sounds, you can get a
basic understanding of the history of this building in
just ten minutes’ (30s, F).2 Another commented, ‘It
(digital display) gets your attention through a combination of various presentations; you will pay attention
while it is speaking’ (40s, M).
Participation, engagement and immersion were also
reported by the respondents as meaningful experiences

quotations. F = female, M = male.

Liu Built Heritage

(2020) 4:14

that digital technologies satisfactorily provided. The
interactive presentations supported by digital technologies were well appreciated by the majority of the participants: ‘Interaction is very important. Most of the
displays at cultural heritage sites provide a one-sided experience; it is more interesting to have a sense of participation’ (70s, M). Another participant ‘Thought it was
interesting. Something will be displayed after the operation, and the content will be different each time it appears so that you’ll want to go through it again and
again’ (20s, F). In addition, the interviewees indicated
that they felt immersed and gained a sense of historical
engagement created by digital technologies, especially
AR and VR, during their visit: ‘It’s more contemporary
and intimate, like following them through history’; ‘We
basically rely on our imagination for historical things,
but this technology (VR), although it relies on simulation, allows us to enter into the historical scene, to be
there, to hear, to see, to feel, to have a sense of profundity’ (40s, F).
Furthermore, a certain amount of negative feedback
on digital interpretation and presentation focusing on
three main areas was provided during the postquestionnaire interviews. First, issues related to equipment and supporting hardware were mentioned repeatedly. Digital displays need to be presented with
the help of supporting equipment, and some interactive displays require users to operate the corresponding equipment themselves. According to the
survey results, a common view among the vast majority of female interviewees was that some of the handheld devices used at OZC (i.e., the AR devices
provided at the site) were too heavy and became a
burden on users’ hands after a period of use; other
devices also suffered from problems such as mismatches with users’ height and caused eye discomfort.
Moreover, several of the parents interviewed were
concerned that some digital devices were difficult for
children to operate independently. Second, there were
a small number of negative comments focused on the
disruption caused by the stacking of too many dynamic elements. During the interviews, some visitors
indicated that too many motion effects (i.e., sound,
motion pictures, and other feedback generated in conjunction with user actions, etc.) were presented at the
same time while they were watching the content on
the display, which to some extent affected their access
to history. Finally, a few interviewees, mainly those
with a cultural history-related background or history
enthusiasts, considered that part of the digital display
content could be improved in terms of its relevance
to heritage history. For example, one interviewee said,

Page 11 of 15

‘It has more interaction, but fewer parts that are integrated with history; It’s more interesting, but some
historical content is sacrificed’ (40s, F). Another commented, ‘The AR game at OZC is fun on its own, but
the content part of it could be a little more in depth;
it is like triggering the event, but the event itself, in
terms of getting to know the history of OZC, is of
limited practical use’ (30s, F).
In summary, the overwhelming majority perceived
that digital display technologies were impressive,
allowed them to learn more about the site during
their visit and increased their willingness to seek
knowledge about heritage. Some individuals stated
that due to the special nature of this presentation,
they were more willing to share their experiences and
gains with others. Moreover, nearly all of the respondents (88.9%) indicated that they would use digital
display devices and technologies when visiting other
cultural heritage sites.

Discussion
The findings relating to the expectation of heritage
site visitation indicated that experiencing digital technologies has become a vital motivation and attraction
for visitors. In addition, the results of visceral-level
experience show a high level of acceptance of digital
interpretation and presentation technologies and a
high willingness to interact with digital settings at different heritage sites from a large proportion of the
participants, especially young respondents. Therefore,
it can be theorized that on-site digital display technologies are becoming an important component of
the heritage visitor experience, with a similar result
presented by Othman et al. (2011). To a certain
extent, introducing digital technologies may be beneficial for heritage sites to attract wider visitor segments,
especially young technology enthusiasts (Leask et al.
2013).
However, although digital technologies are increasingly becoming attractions for heritage visitors, the respondent characteristic and pre-visit experience results
show that the majority of the participants had limited
exposure to digital display technologies in their past
visits to heritage sites and that a significant number of
them were first introduced to digital settings such as
AR and VR at OZC. Accordingly, digital display technology ‘beginners’ (Cooper et al. 2007) constitute the
majority of heritage site visitors at the present stage.
Additionally, most digital display settings are no longer
a unilateral presentation of information but require
user participation, which to some extent increases the

Liu Built Heritage

(2020) 4:14

difficulty of initial use. Therefore, to ensure rapid, efficient and targeted interaction, it is essential to
optimize the basic usability, learnability and accessibility design of digital display settings, for which the lowest results among all four factors in this visitor
experience survey were obtained. Meanwhile, the instruction and guidance services offered by heritage site
workers are also considered to be helpful in enhancing
visitors’ first use experience, especially the sense of security, with unfamiliar digital technologies, according
to the questionnaire findings and results of the interviews with OZC employees and visitors.
In addition to usability, the survey relating to visitors’ behavioural-level experience evaluated three
other components: information/knowledge, engagement, and entertainment. The survey results supported the work of Masberg and Silverman (1996),
Poria et al. (2006) and Packer and Ballantyne (2016),
who argued that gaining more knowledge and knowing more about heritage were still the main purposes
of visiting heritage sites. Meanwhile, the visitor experience findings revealed that the dynamic presentation incorporating multiple media (i.e., sound, moving
image, 3D animation) with digital technology support
had obvious advantages in recreating historical scenes
and damaged artefacts and in visually presenting historical contents and that it had a significant effect in
helping visitors quickly, intuitively and easily understand heritage, enhancing their interest in learning
and deepening their impression of heritage. However,
the findings also indicated that the simultaneous use
of excessive dynamic effects and overly voluminous
multimedia content tend to reduce the clarity of heritage presentation, thus interfering with visitors’ experience accessing information. This result highlights
the need for and importance of user testing before officially launching digital display settings to assess the
impact of different combinations of presentation technologies and the design of presentation effects on visitors to ensure appropriate use. In addition, the
results identified an association between visitors’ prior
knowledge of heritage and their needs in terms of the
depth and breadth of digital presentation content.
Stewart et al. (1998) proposed a similar finding and
suggested that the provision of interpretation should
be differentiated by visitor type (seekers, stumblers,
shadowers, and shunners). Given the advantages of
digital technology in the identification of user information and the segmentation of user needs (Kong
and Rong 2017) as well as the technical superiority of
digital displays in presenting diverse, interactive heritage content, it is highly feasible for heritage sites to
further satisfy the diverse needs of visitors from different categories by creating and providing more

Page 12 of 15

targeted, hierarchical, and customizable digital display
content.
A study by Kong and Rong (2017) pointed out
that a heritage display system was a pleasure-oriented information system and emphasized the need
to enhance visitors’ perceived enjoyment. In this
study, the findings reveal the importance of digital
technologies in the creation of enhanced on-site entertaining experiences. In particular, some digital
presentations that incorporated story-based content
and game-like participation helped create a more interesting learning process. In addition to the mechanical digitization of various heritage information,
some creative development and transformation (i.e.,
storytelling narrative or gamification) in the forms
or content of digital displays will contribute to enhancing and enriching the visitor experience at cultural heritage sites. Nevertheless, this study also
showed weaknesses associated with an overemphasis on entertainment design, which affected
the systematization and clarity of heritage messaging, as a result of which the visitor experience
process lacked effective access to heritage information. Therefore, a good balance should be struck in
the design of digital displays to avoid diluting the
connotation and value of cultural heritage due to
excessive entertainment content.
The results emphasized that visitors are willing to
actively participate in some co-creation processes
and to interact with different digital display settings. Consequently, they tend to spend more time
exploring and experiencing different displays compared to general static displays. Moscardo (1996)
proposed a similar result and highlighted that interactive displays had a positive effect on increasing
visitors’ interest and effectiveness in learning. The
findings also highlighted that these interactive processes, overcome the limitations of traditional forms
of display, which are mainly limited to a unilateral
information transfer, and help empower visitors’
historical engagement and involvement. Furthermore, the majority of the participants considered
that digital presentation, especially the immersive
environment created by AR or VR, conveyed a
sense of historical immediacy apart from other display forms. Li (2010) highlighted that one of the ultimate goals for cultural heritage was to find ways
to bring people back to the site, to be there, and to
have a direct dialogue. For cultural heritage sites,
especially those that are no longer fully accessible
to visitors, introducing creative technologies in
heritage presentation will lead to a breakthrough in
recreating a user-perceptible, conversational historical environment.

Additionally, the study revealed that compared to
the older participants, the young participants showed
greater recognition of the entertainment and immersive experience offered by digital technologies, which
raises the question of how to better balance the experience of different age groups when planning digital
displays.
Regarding reflective-level experience, most visitors
recognized that digital display technologies provided a
relatively comprehensive introduction to heritage and,
to a certain extent, further triggered them to think in
depth about the development and current status of
cultural heritage. Overall, the establishment of the visitor’s reflective experience is the result of the synergy
and cooperation of various presentations within the
whole display system (Li and Yan 2018); among them,
research has shown that the advantages of digital displays in these aspects, such as the integration of
multimedia content presentation, the interactive display process, and the creation of immersive historical
scenes, play significant roles in enhancing the comprehensiveness and depth of visitors’ understanding of
heritage sites.

Limitations of this research and future
directions
The evaluation of this study focuses on a range of
digital technologies (including AR, VR, projection
mapping, etc.) used for heritage presentation at OZC
rather than on any specific technology. Therefore, this
study can be followed by further testing related to the
specific role and impact of a representative type of
technology in heritage interpretation and presentation.
Furthermore, future research can use on-site observations to investigate details on visitors’ interaction with
different digital settings, which can complement the
results of this quantitative study to provide further insights into visitors’ digital experience at the operational level. Finally, as an effective supplement to
traditional displays, digital interpretation and presentation have created many new possibilities for heritage
communication, but the addition of new forms does
not mean a complete abandonment of traditional
ways. Conversely, how to establish an interconnected
and complementary relationship between digital and
traditional displays (i.e., physical displays or live tours)
to jointly build a visitor-centred heritage display system is an issue that warrants investigation in the next
stage of research.
Conclusion
This study aimed to evaluate visitors’ experience of
digital interpretation and presentation technologies at

Page 13 of 15

cultural heritage sites. On the basis of a review of the
relevant literature, an evaluation framework, with key
aspects and factors influencing visitors’ digital experience at a heritage site pre-visitation (prior knowledge,
motivations, expectations), during visitation (viscerallevel, behavioural-level and reflective-level experience),
and post-visitation (overall evaluations and satisfaction, gains from the visit), was developed. Based on
this framework, a multi-approach survey, combining
on-site investigations and interviews, was conducted
at OZC, Taiwan.
The investigation of visitors’ motivations and
visceral-level experience indicated that digital display
technologies received high acceptance from heritage
visitors and motivated them to explore the site. In
addition, regarding the perception of use during the
visit, the results indicated that the presence of digital
interpretation and presentation technologies at OZC
contributed to a positive heritage visitation. Specifically, the dynamic, participatory, and immersive nature of digital display technologies enhanced the
effectiveness, interactivity, and interest in the communication of heritage culture and values. Such
technologies helped the public visualize the richness
of the site and enhanced their interest in gaining
more knowledge about the heritage; furthermore,
they enriched the on-site heritage experience. In particular, some interactive and gaming programs had a
significant impact on visitors’ entertainment experience and, more importantly, created new experiences
for visitors to perceive, engage with and communicate with history. Moreover, based on the analysis of
the visitor experience data, this study suggests several areas for further improvement and attention in
digital display design and management, such as improving the usability of digital settings, innovating
digital display content, and promoting the personalized display of the site, to better meet visitors’ expectations and guarantee more satisfying visitor
heritage experiences.
However, it is also important to recognize that the
use of digital technology is not a replacement for
cultural heritage itself; rather, it is a medium for
heritage communication as well as a support for and
complement to visitors’ experience of heritage (Guo
and Zhuang 2017; Li 2010). The fundamental purpose of the digital presentation and interpretation of
cultural heritage can be better achieved by unifying
multi-layered heritage content and digital technologies to serve the cultural needs of visitors while at
the same time actively creating valuable cultural,
technological and emotional experiences for visitors
and further inspiring them to resonate with heritage
values.
