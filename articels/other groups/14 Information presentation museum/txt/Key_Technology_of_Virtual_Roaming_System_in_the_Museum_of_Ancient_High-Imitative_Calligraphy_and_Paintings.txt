ABSTRACT To show the traditional Chinese painting and the spiritual culture of 
universities, highlight the
artistic accumulation and cultural heritage, analyze the value and significance 
of digitalizing the Museum
of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting, Qingdao Agricultural 
University (QAU) is regarded as
the research object. The design principles of the digital museum are clarified 
by understanding the specific
user needs, and the 3DS Max is utilized to develop a roaming system for the 
Museum of Ancient High-
Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU through Unity3d, a Virtual Reality 
(VR) software platform.
Besides, the perspective control, collision detection of virtual characters and 
scenes, and control of pop-up
information display windows are realized to achieve the interactive design of 
users and the QAU digital
museum system. Finally, from the four aspects of resource content, information 
presentation, resource
presentation, and learning effect, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted. The 
research results show that
more than 80% of people think that the content satisfaction of virtual system 
resources is high, which is more
scientific and accurate; more than 65% think that the information is presented 
better, and 87% think that the
system is open enough; in addition, nearly one-third of the visitors believe 
that using the system can initiate
their interest and motivation in learning. This shows that the learning and 
cultural communication effects of
the virtual system are more obvious. This system realizes the objective of 
disseminating traditional classic
art culture and values by new technical means, which has reference significance 
for research in other fields.

I. INTRODUCTION

Museums are carriers for disseminating, preserving, and
displaying historical and cultural knowledge, science, tech-
nology, and social features to the public. With the develop-
ment of China’s culture and education, museums have been
valued by more people [1]. The major function of museums
is to spread the scientific and technological concepts, cultural
connotations, and true meaning of life to the visitor through
entertainment and art [2]. The digital museum can drive
visitors to learn and experience digital history and culture
through multimedia forms, such as pictures and videos [3].
Research on digital museums started in the United States.
With the continuous development and popularization of com-
puter technology [4], [5], US scientists incorporated the col-
lection information into the network database system to make

the collection information break through the limitations of
physical museums [6]. Olesen (2016) found that countries
are strengthening the application of computers in the field of
museums, and have begun to use digital virtual technology
to protect their cultural heritage [7]. How to better embody
the museums’ functions of display, education, and research,
better serve the society and the public, and promote the
development of the museums is a more prominent problem
currently [8]. As the network information technology devel-
ops rapidly, the virtual digital museums built by network
technology and Virtual Reality (VR) technology widen the
extension space and maximize the function of the museums,
forming a fast, comprehensive, and effective way of visiting
museums [9]. Therefore, studying digital museums is of great
significance for the public to understand history and culture.
The digital museum is a virtual museum that is presented
on the Internet in three-dimensional form based on three-
dimensional imaging technology, interactive manipulation

technology, VR technology, and special effect production
technology [10]. Specifically, it uses the Internet and the
internal information architecture system of the institution
to display the business work of traditional museums in a
computer virtual network; by closely integrating the two,
the museum is presented to the public in a virtual form; such a
virtual form uses a lively three-dimensional model to replaces
the original boring plane data so that the function of the
physical museum can be fully realized [11]. Pu and Zhao
(2018) found that when choosing which cultural heritage
resources to display, the museum needs to consider not only
the resources available to the museum itself but also the
intensity of the user’s demand for specific information [12].
China began the research, exploration, and construction of
virtual museums in the early 1990s. Due to the strong sup-
port of government departments in policies, coupled with
strong social needs, a good start has been created for the
development of virtual museums in China. The digitaliza-
tion of museums has become more mature and standardized
both technically and theoretically [13]. As a place to collect,
protect, and display various important exhibits, university
museums are an important part of the cultural infrastructure
of colleges and universities, and an important education base
for implementing quality education and improving the cul-
tural quality of students [14]. The continuous development
of computer technology has promoted the development of
virtual reality technology and made it possible to digitalize
the QAU Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy
and Painting. The digital museum can provide users with
sufficient convenience and has attracted increasingly more
attention from users.

By clarifying the design principles of the digital museum
and understanding the specific user needs, the 3DS Max is
utilized to develop a roaming system for the Museum of
Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of Qingdao
Agricultural University (QAU) through Unity3d, a Virtual
Reality (VR) software platform. This will play a positive
role in the protection of the works and the promotion of the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU. Here, the VR technology is applied to the field
of museum digitalization for the first time, which is a bold
attempt of new technology in the fields of art and culture.
Through the digital design of the Museum of Ancient High-
Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU, the physical
museum building and display will be reconstructed with dig-
ital technology, which will greatly facilitate the user’s visit,
as well as the reproduction, protection, and promotion of
cultural relics.

II. METHODS

A. 3D SCENE-MODELING TECHNOLOGY

In the process of designing and implementing the VR system,
the virtual environment must be designed and constructed
in detail. Therefore, the modeling and construction of a 3D
scene has a huge influence on the implementation of the
entire virtual reality system. Only through 3D scene modeling

can operations such as real-time rendering, texture map-
ping, lighting processing, interaction, and real-time roam-
ing be performed on the system, thereby making the virtual
world built more realistic. The current 3D scene modeling
technology is mostly based on the following technologies:

(1) geometry-based modeling technology; (2) image-based
modeling technology; (3) geometric and image-based hybrid
modeling technology.

The objective is to show the content and characteristics
of ancient high-imitative calligraphy and painting. Image-
based modeling technology has a small amount of calculation
and a fast modeling process. At the same time, it does not
require high computer configuration. Users can easily realize
the implementation of complex scene modeling through their
computers. This technology uses external equipment to shoot
the scene in real-time and the computers to process and
splice the image information in the scene; therefore, the scene
can be presented to the users more realistically, meeting the
requirements of different users to observe and operate the
scene from multiple angles. The modeling method based
on image rendering can quickly collect scene data during
the modeling process, as well as realistically reflecting the
object characteristics in the scene. In addition, it can solve
the problems encountered in the process of digital museum
scene modeling, such as user interaction with virtual objects
and the lack of immersion in the scene.

Therefore, in the virtual modeling process of the museum
scene, the hybrid modeling method is adopted. The
panoramic modeling of the scene is carried out through image
processing technology, and the image information is collected
from multiple angles and sent to the computer for processing,
thereby producing a more realistic visual experience of the
model. Besides, the geometry-based modeling methods are
utilized to design interactions between users and museum
collection models, achieving a better display effect of the
QAU museum. The hybrid modeling technology is shown
in Fig. 1:

FIGURE 1. Process of hybrid modeling technology.

B. 3D SCENE-ROAMING TECHNOLOGY

The 3D roaming system presents not only a real space but
also a real simulated virtual space of an imaginary space,



which is a virtual environment within a specific range. The
virtual environment has the characteristics of real integration
of viewing, listening, and touching. The roaming users are in
the virtual space in a natural way. In this space, the users must
use the necessary equipment to observe in all directions. The
virtual objects in the environment not only can make users
feel immersive but also can be planned and operated. Roam-
ing scenes are mainly divided into indoor scene management
and outdoor scene planning.

(1) Indoor scene management based on Binary Space
Partitioning (BSP) tree:

Technically, BSP utilizes walls or glass to divide the space.
These walls or glass are orthogonal or approximately orthog-
onal in the building body; in this way, the objects in the
space can be gradually separated according to the pre-defined
walls or glass. Then, these separated objects are separated
again into other independent spaces, which can be rendered
independently. Therefore, a subspace organized by the BSP
tree    is formed. This subspace is formed through such a static
preprocessing technology, and the subspace that needs to be
rendered is rendered through the real-time rendering tech-
nology. This improves the efficiency of real-time rendering,
during which the system only needs to render the dynamic
parts. The specific algorithm flowchart is shown in Fig. 2:

FIGURE 2. Algorithm structure of indoor scene management based on
BSP tree.

(2) Image-based outdoor virtual roaming technology:

The basic data of image-based virtual roaming technology
come from the process of collecting information. Some of the
data come from discrete images collected by cameras, and
some from continuous images collected by cameras. These
information data are processed through image processing to
obtain the panoramic images. Then, the obtained panoramic
images are organized into a virtual reality space. During
this organization process, a suitable space model is chosen.
In this virtual reality space, users can operate the scene in
different directions, which realizes 3D scene roaming from all
aspects.

A panoramic image generator and a space editor are uti-
lized to generate a virtual reality space. The panoramic image
generator is mainly responsible for stitching ordinary images
or videos into panoramic images. These ordinary images
have overlapping parts, and the video is continuous. The
space editor organizes many panoramic images into a vir-
tual real space, and the image processing includes perspec-
tive transformation, flattening, compositing, and cropping
methods.

C. OVERALL DESIGN OF THE DIGITAL MUSEUM

User demand and system positioning of digital museum
system: the goal of analyzing the user needs of the digital
museum system and the positioning of the system design is
to meet the needs of visitors and thus generate practical val-
ues [15]–[19]. The system design is to reproduce the Museum
of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU
building as realistically as possible so that users can have the
same experience of visiting the physical museum through the
system. To achieve this goal, in terms of the system content,
it  is necessary to fully utilize various forms of media such as
images, sounds, and videos, which is of great historical and
aesthetic value to the comprehensively describe the buildings
of the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and
Painting of QAU. First, by observing and comparing the
topographic structure and model characteristics of the project,
a 3D laser scanner is utilized to obtain cloud data in the school
museum, as well as taking photos of details such as doors,
windows, stairs, and booths. The obtained cloud data are
imported into 3D Max to create a 3D model with the photos.
Then, the model is imported into the VR-Platform to make
virtual scenes and interactive functions. Finally, the model is
saved as an exe file and exported. The entire virtual roaming
system is completed.

(1) Design principles: the first is optimization. To ensure
the operating efficiency of the system while not losing the
quality of the image as much as possible, two processing
methods are adopted. One method is to use textures instead of
modeling with subtle parts to reduce the data volume of the
model while ensuring that the model will not lose the image
quality, that is, using textures to supplement the lack of detail
caused by the model; as for the other method, by splitting
a model into multiple models and selecting different scenes
to choose to load different models, the data amount of a
single model can be as low as possible. In addition, in the
process of modeling, it is also necessary to try to reduce
the number of faces and vertices of the model, as well as
reducing the calculation of computer rendering during the
later roaming process. The second is intuition. When visitors
from different regions and even different countries are expe-
riencing the digital museum, they will inevitably encounter
cultural differences in understanding the exhibits through the
senses such as vision and hearing. How to enable visitors in
different regions to better understand the culture and spirit
contained in the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Callig-
raphy and Painting of QAU requires the principle of intu-
itiveness in the digital design process of the museum, that is,
not only the language and characters but also the multimedia
methods such as graphics, images, and sound are used in
the display of the digital museum so that people from all
walks of life in different regions, cultures, and ethnic groups
can better enjoy and learn about the art and culture of the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU.

(2) Overall process: before the digital model of the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting



of QAU and surrounding scenes are formally produced, it is
necessary to collect information about the relevant physical

where the modulus of the point (m, n) is calculated as:

M ᵈf (m n) = q W ¹ f (m n) 2 + W ²jd f (m n) 2  (3)


eled through the architectural design drawings of the building

and assisted with on-site building photos. For the surrounding
scenes, on the one hand, photos of the scene environment are

taken; on the other hand, the size of the surrounding scenes
can be referred to the size of the museum building. The overall

where W ² ᵈ f (m, n) is the discrete binary wavelet transform

process is shown in Fig. 3:                        2 j         1 d


FIGURE 3. Virtual roaming design process for the Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU.

D. IMAGE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING

(1) Image collection: it mainly utilizes the image scanning
method. The approximate location of the scanner site is
set according to the internal structure of the museum, and
the scanning is started under the premise of minimizing
occlusion. To facilitate the later point registration, it should
be noted that a 10%-20% overlap should be set between
the scanned data of each two stations. The scanned data
can be used in 3D Max after a series of processing such
as registration, impurity removal, and format conversion
through software. Then, the internal structure of the museum
is observed. According to the needs of model material and

value of point 2, and W₂ j f (m, n) is the discrete binary
wavelet transform value of point 1.

Second, due to the differences between different images,
image registration technology is also utilized. Image regis-
tration finds the conversion relationship in multiple images.
These images must be in the same area, mainly in the same
scene. Then they are matched. The image is defined as fol-
lows: I₁ and I₂ are used to represent the reference image and
the image to be registered, respectively; thus, the registration

relationship between the two images is as follows:

I₂(x, y) = g(I₁(f (x, y)))        (5)

In (5), f and g represent the 2D geometric transformation
function and the one-dimensional gray-scale transformation
function, I₂(x, y) and I₁(x, y) represent the gray value of
the reference image and the image to be registered at the
point (x, y), respectively. Normally, g does not need to be
calculated; thus, the task of image registration is to obtain the

optimal f . Hence, the above equation can be simplified into:

I₂(x, y) = I₁(f (x, y))         (6)

To detect the details of images, the Haar classifier is uti-
lized. This is a traditional image processing algorithm based
on machine learning, which mainly relies on the rotation of
the image to obtain the feature values of different images.
This type of algorithm is characterized by fast detection and
slow training. The specific calculation process is as follows:
First, the image is filtered and detected. The filtering is
completed according to the difference operators in the vertical
and horizontal directions, and the respective derivatives Iₓ
and Iy of the pixels are calculated in the two vertical direc-

tions, thereby obtaining the following matrix:

m =  I 2Ix Iy           (7)


a camera and processed with Photoshop software.

(2) Image processing: the method of wavelet transform
operator is utilized. If the image p has different pixels, p
is decomposed at a certain scale, and the appropriate 2D
smoothing function θ (x, y) is selected; then, the function will

be defined as:

IₓIyIy

After the Gaussian filtering of the above matrix m is
passed, the Gaussian function of autocorrelation function
matrix M is:

w  exp(  x2 − y2 )         (8)

2πσ 2


∂θ (x, y)

ψ                               

∂x

(1)

Then, the matrix M could be expressed as:

M = m ⊗ w =  I 2Ix Iy  ⊗ exp(− x2 − y2 )   (9)


ψ ²(x, y) =

∂θ (x, y)

(2)

IₓIyI ²

2πσ 2


∂x

By constructing a discrete filter, the discrete binary wavelet
transform of each point is calculated on different scales,

The above calculation obtains the Harris corner detection
operator R for each pixel, where:

R = det(M ) − KTr²(M )       (10)



When the operator R is greater than some threshold,
the corner point is regarded as a point that obtains a local
extreme value in some field. Here, R  0.3 and K is a
constant.

E. IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL MUSEUM
VIRTUAL SYSTEM

(1) Model scene implementation: the 3D Max software is
used for design and production. Before making the building
model of the QAU Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Callig-
raphy and Painting, first, the corresponding scene construc-
tion method is selected according to the shape and structural
characteristics of the building. The system adopts the hybrid
scene construction method. This method first establishes the
bottom surface of the building model; then, through the mod-
ification toll in the extrusion tool kit, the plane is made into
a 3D building, and the roof is made by referring to the build-
ing. In the entire building modeling process, CAD drawings
must first be imported into 3D Max, which are utilized as
the background view of the entire view window. By using
the drawings as the dimension basis, the outer contour of the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU building is formed by drawing lines. Based on the
outer contour, through the modification toll in the extrusion
tool kit, the 2D line contour is extruded into a 3D geometry,
which is the model of the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative
Calligraphy and Painting of QAU building. In the process
of extrusion, the height of the building is considered, which
should be above the height of the two floors plus the height
of the ground and roof. The roof is constructed by the method
of patch modeling, and the external facade on the side of the
building is constructed by adding planes. The detail model is
shown in Fig. 4:

FIGURE 4. Reproduction of the building detail model of QAU Museum of
Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting.

(2) Assigning materials and textures: after the scene is cre-
ated, it can be assigned with materials. The final model should
be imported into the VRP editor to build the virtual roaming
system. VRP only supports standard materials; therefore,
advanced materials such as Vray and Mental Vray should be
avoided when modeling. After the model material is assigned,
the ‘‘UVW’’ map should be added to facilitate the adjustment

of the material in the VRP. It should be noted that to optimize
the effect, fine photos of details should be taken, such as stair
handrails, marble steps, wooden doors, and windows; also,
the Photoshop software is utilized for editing and color ton-
ing. After all textures are created, the 3D Max model needs to
be exported in.obj format, and the exported model is imported
into Deep Paint 3D to prepare for the subsequent mapping of
the entire building. Deep Paint 3D is a model mapping tool,
which maps the plan to the surface of the 3D model. Multiple
layers are created in Deep Paint 3D software. The textures are
mapped from multiple angles to the museum building model
one by one. Finally, the mapped models are imported into
3D Max software. The texture production process is shown
in Fig. 5:

FIGURE 5. Process of texture production.

(3) Lighting arrangement: light is set, and a free spotlight
is established. The spotlight parameter is set to 40, and the
attenuation parameter is set to 60. The spotlight is copied to
the top of the showcase for lighting according to the layout
of the venue. Floodlights are established to fill the dark parts
of the scene. 3D Max has its lights and supports Vray lights.
VRP also supports these two lights. The Vray renderer has
excellent performance and effects; thus, the Vray renderer is
recommended. When arranging the lights, the light sources
should be minimized. Too many light sources will increase
the system overhead. When adding the light sources, the order
of the main light source and then the auxiliary light source
should be followed. In addition to making the model more
realistic, the lights should also bring out the lighting effect
of the spotlight. Therefore, parameters such as ‘‘multiplier’’
and ‘‘sampling range’’ in the shadow map of the light should
be set carefully. After the rendering is finished, the lights
are adjusted to obtain the required effects. The adjustment
process is shown in Fig. 6.

(4) Scene baking: the goal of baking is optimization. Bak-
ing light maps will produce lighting and shadow effects to
create fake lighting. When lighting effects are not considered,
baking light maps is unnecessary. Using only textures to
express the effects will reduce the amount of calculations that
files are imported into the engine, which can make the project
more efficient. Since the model built in 3D Max needs to be
imported into VRP, the following points when baking should
be valued: VRP only supports the textures of the two baking
methods of Complete Map and Lighting Map; the default



FIGURE 6. Process of light adjustment.

texture of baking is 256 256, but large-sized objects should
be resized; the baked texture cannot have the same name. The
model after scene baking is shown in Fig. 7.

FIGURE 7. Scene baking renderings.

F. PATH PLANNING PROBLEMS IN VIRTUAL ROAMING

Of late years, there have been great breakthroughs in path
planning, mainly in the fields of robots, unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), and virtual reality. While solving the path
planning problems, the path-finding algorithm is gradu-
ally updated, and new algorithms with better performance
appear one after another. Under different scenarios, the
performance of the path-finding algorithm is different, and

approach the optimal solution. Meanwhile, each individual
can affect the surrounding environment by releasing
pheromone, as well as perceiving the real-time changes in
the surrounding environment. Besides, ACO algorithm is a
heuristic search, which is not easy to fall into the local opti-
mum. In nature, ants will choose the route with the highest
pheromone concentration and continue to release pheromone
during the journey so that the pheromone concentration on
this path always remains the highest.

The ACO algorithm takes a long time during searching;
after the algorithm searches to some extent, all ants will
choose the same path, which is not conducive for the algo-
rithm to further search the solution space. Therefore, the algo-
rithm will fall into the local optimum prematurely; in other
words, premature phenomenon occurs. Hence the traditional
ACO algorithm is improved before being applied to the path
planning of the virtual roaming system, which will improve
the performance of the algorithm and make the system more
efficient and reliable.

Because the chaotic optimization has the characteristics
of using the chaotic sequence to traverse all the states in
some range without repetitively traversing, it has obtained
superior performance than the random sequence. Therefore,
the chaotic optimization theory is adopted to improve the
ACO algorithm. The improvement ideas are: (1) using the
advantages of the faster search speed of the turbidity opti-
mization to generate a set of better solutions to solve the
problem of lacking initial pheromone houses in the ant colony
algorithm; (2) using the chaotic disturbance to jump out
of  the local optimal solution and introducing it into the
ACO algorithm to enhance the later search ability of the
algorithm.

Based on the Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) theory,
the pheromone is disturbed by the idea of secondary carrier in
chaotic optimization, which makes the algorithm stronger and
enables the algorithm with the ability to jump out of the local
optimal solution. The improved Chaos MMAS (CMMAS)
algorithm uses the branch influence factor λ to determine
whether it is stuck, which is a quantity related to the search
space dimension. The branching factor λi is defined as the

number of subsequent edges where node i meets the condi-
tion. The specific definition process is as follows:

τi,j > λiδi + τj,min            (11)

δi = τj,max − τj,min           (12)

τj,mₐₓ  max τi,j            (13)

j∈Ni

τj,min  min τi,j             (14)

j∈Ni


various application scenarios also put forward higher require-
ments for the efficiency and storage space of the path-finding
algorithms.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a newly
developed bionic optimization algorithm that simulates the
group behaviors of ants in nature foraging. The ACO algo-
rithm uses a positive feedback mechanism to converge
the searching process continuously, and finally, gradually

where i and j are two points forming an edge, Ni represents the
set of all nodes connected to node i, τi,j is the value obtained
from the pheromone update operation, and Gᵏ (t) is the path
length of the current elite ants, that is, the global optimal path
length.



The chaotic method is utilized to perturb the pheromone,
and the following equations are obtained:

c   τi,j − τmin 

i,j  τmax − τmin

τ ᶜ (t + 1) = ρτᶜ (t) + r ∗ (2c − 1)    (17)

animation is the basis of multiple fixed roaming effects,
and multiple cameras should be attached to it. This system
realizes the roaming of the scene in two ways through the
character tracking camera, walking camera and character
control camera. When using the role tracking camera for


In (16) and (17), ρ represents the retention rate of
pheromone, τmₐₓ is the maximum value of pheromone, τmin is
the minimum value of pheromone, r is the chaotic disturbance
radius, and c is the chaotic factor generated by Tent mapping.

G. IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL MUSEUM
ROAMING SYSTEM

(1) The development of interactive functions: it is controlled
by the script engine in the Unity3D virtual roaming engine.
The biggest advantage of Unity 3D is the cross-platform
nature of the scripting language. In the past, software often
did not have such characteristics. The compiled program can
only run on a single platform, which is very inconvenient.
In Unity 3D, most of the platform-related code is placed
inside the game engine so that the code related to the game
content can be executed across platforms, which is convenient
and fast, and saves a lot of manpower and material resources.
Before digitizing the interactive design of the Museum of
Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU
system, the preparatory work that needs to be done is to
import the intermediate conversion data format FBX file
generated in the early stage into the newly created project file
in Unity 3D. Because the objects in the scene must have basic
collision detection functions, the size of each model and the
option to accept collision must be checked before creating the
scene. After adjusting the position of each model, it is nec-
essary to create the material of the model. The development
process of Unity 3D is shown in Fig. 8:

two modes, ‘‘movement control’’ and ‘‘fixed-point viewing’’,
should be noted. Movement control mode means that the
camera moves with the character; while in the fixed-point
viewing mode, the camera is fixed, only the character is
moving, and the viewing angle distance will vary with the
character’s movement. In autonomous roaming, the ‘‘far clip-
ping plane’’ and ‘‘near clipping plane’’ in the properties of
the walking camera can define the clipping distance in the
camera perspective. The system will use the default value, or
the value can be customized according to the needs of the
scene. It should be noted that when the ‘‘walking’’ mode is
selected, the system will automatically turn on the collision
detection of the camera. In the flight mode, users can choose
whether to detect the collision according to their needs. In the
‘‘Character Control’’ camera, users can double-click the cam-
era, choose to track the created character model, and adjust
the parameters. After all the parameters are set, users can
perform simple autonomous roaming through W (forward) S
(backward) A (left shift) D (right shift) keys on the keyboard,
as shown in Fig. 9.


FIGURE 8. Function implementation of Unity 3D.

(2) Roaming system: there are two major roaming modes
in VRP, the fixed roaming and autonomous roaming. The
fixed roaming is simple; the autonomous roaming is highly
free and has many viewing angles, whose user experience
is more sufficient. Walking along a fixed route in skeletal

FIGURE 9. Schematic diagram of roaming system implementation.

(3) System display mode: for the Windows version of
the digital roaming system of the Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU, the final
product system is an.exe file that can be run directly.
It can run directly in the Windows system environment



by double-clicking. Control commands are input through
commonly used user command input interfaces (keyboard
and mouse), and the corresponding movement is generated
through the system’s recognition of the commands. The
default keyboard control mode of the digital museum roaming
system is to control the forward, backward, left, and right
movement of the viewing angle in the system through the
WSAD key of the keyboard; the left and right keys of the
mouse are used to control the left and right rotation of the
viewing angle in the system.

H. EVALUATION OF DIGITAL MUSEUM SYSTEM EFFECTS
To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the digital
museum system, the overall indicator evaluation system of
Likert scale is adopted. From the dimensions of ‘‘resource
content, information presentation, resource presentation, and
learning effect’’, a questionnaire survey is performed. The

personnel of QAU museum fill in the questionnaire imme-
diately after they use the system. The questions are designed
according to relevant literature, and the reliability and validity
of  the questionnaire data are tested.

(1) Reliability analysis: the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient
method proposed by Hadjichambis et al. (2020) is utilized
[20]. When the coefficient is between 0.7-0.8, it means that
the questionnaire results have a high degree of credibility;
when the coefficient is between 0.65-0.7, the reliability is
within the acceptable range, when the coefficient is between
0.6-0.7, the questionnaire survey results are not credible [21].

(2) Validity analysis: Ratio Statistic Test (RST) method is
used for validity analysis, which is judged by redundancy
and sensitivity. The Redundancy Degree (RD) represents the
independence and redundancy of each indicator. When RD is
0.5, it means the indicator is valid. The smaller the RD value
is, the higher the validity is. The Sensitivity Degree (SD)
represents the adaptability of different evaluation systems
on evaluation indicators. When SD is  5, the indicator is

valid [22].

(3) The questionnaire is designed according to the three-
level indicators in the performance evaluation. Each ques-
tion has 5 options: ‘‘very non-conforming’’, ‘‘relatively
non-conforming’’, ‘‘general’’, ‘‘relatively conforming’’, and
‘‘very conforming’’, corresponding to 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and

0.2 points. A total of 300 questionnaires have been issued, and
292 questionnaires have been recovered, in which 280 copies
are valid. The recovery rate is 97%, and the valid rate is 97%.
Among them, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are very inconsistent,
relatively inconsistent, general, relatively consistent, and very
consistent.

(4) Normalization processing: before modeling, all the data
are normalized first. The calculation method utilized is as
follows: all results are averagely weighted to calculate the
final score of each indicator, and the normalized interval

is [0, 1]. The specific equation is as follows:

To reduce the error effectively, all the matrices are tested
for consistency. The specific calculation is as follows:

CI = (λmₐₓ − n) / (n − 1)       (19)

In (19), λmₐₓ is the maximum eigenvalue, which is the
average value of Awi/wi; wi is the component vector of each
row of the matrix multiplied by the weight W and summed;
Awi/wi is the divisor of the matrix and its corresponding
component vector; N is the number of data. Also, the average
random consistency index RI is utilized to determine the
approximate range of inconsistency. The consistency ratio CR
(CR  CI/RI) is adopted to determine whether the matrix
is consistent (if CR is < 0.1, the judgment matrix will be
consistent).

III. RESULTS

A. ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE OF VIRTUAL ROAMING
PATH PLANNING

In the ACO algorithm, the parameter is utilized to adjust the
influence of the remaining pheromone on the path on the next
ant colony search, which controls the convergence speed of
the algorithm. To verify the influence of the parameters on the
algorithm, test cases KroAlOO, d198, eil51 and lin318 of the
standard traveling salesman problem (TSP) are utilized for
testing. The value of ρ starts from 0.1, and a value is taken
every 0.1 for verification. Finally, a set of ρ  0.95 experi-
mental groups is added. Figures 10-13 show the experimental
results with ρ values ranging from 0.5 to 0.95.

FIGURE 10. KroAlOO experiment results of different ρ.

When the number of iterations is small, a smaller value of ρ
can be selected to obtain a better solution. However, this does
not converge faster in the true sense; instead, it prematurely
converges toward the local optimal solution. When the value
of  ρ is large, the algorithm does not have an advantage
when the number of iterations is small; as the number of
iterations increases, the algorithm obtains a stronger spatial
search ability, and finally, obtains a better search result.

Next, the four standard test datasets of KroAlOO, d198,
eil51 and lin318 are utilized to evaluate the performance of

(18)

the ACO algorithm fused with chaotic optimization, which
is compared with the Ant Colony System (ACS) algorithm

and the MMAS algorithm. The comparison results are shown
in Fig. 14-17.

For the small-scale TSP problem eil51 dataset, the opti-
mization efficiency of CMMAS and MMAS is not much
different, and both are significantly better than the traditional
ACS algorithm; at this moment, compared with the MMAS
algorithm, the improved algorithm does not show its superi-
ority. For the KroAlOO and d198 datasets, CMMAS not only
has an advantage in convergence speed but is also superior to
MMAS in terms of solution quality. When CMMAS is tested
in the lin318 dataset, although the convergence speed in the

eil51.

early stage is slightly slower than MMAS, it shows a good
ability in jumping out of the local optimal solution in the
later stage of the search, and finally, obtains better solution
accuracy.

B. DATA INSPECTION OF QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY

The ‘‘Analysis/Measurement/Reliability’’ of the IBM SPSS
Statistics 22 software is utilized to analyze the reliability of
the five dimensions included in the questionnaire separately.
The obtained alpha coefficient values are all greater than 0.8,


TABLE 3. Normalization processing.

FIGURE 17. The iterative convergence curves of different algorithms in
lin318.

TABLE 1. Reliability test of virtual roaming system evaluation system.

FIGURE 18. Evaluation results of resource content saturation.


and the reliability is high. The internal reliability analysis
of 17 indicators shows that the alpha coefficient value is 0.95,
indicating that the scale has high internal consistency and is
a credible measurement tool.

Table 2 shows the validity analysis results of indicators
by the RST method. The RD and SD values are less than
0.5, respectively; therefore, the evaluation indicator system
for the questionnaire survey of virtual roaming system is
effective.

TABLE 2. Validity test of evaluation system of virtual roaming system.

After determining the judgment matrix of the criteria at
all levels, it is necessary to test the consistency of the con-
structed evaluation system for the evaluation system of virtual
roaming system through Matlab 7.0 software. The calculation
results are shown in Table 3, where the CR value of resource
content saturation is 0.0126, information presentation satu-
ration is 0.0158, resource presentation saturation is 0.0079,
and the learning effect saturation is 0.0158. Since all the
CR values and λmₐₓ values are less than 0.1, the data are
reasonable, the evaluation system has passed the consistency
test, and the deviations are small.

C. RESOURCE CONTENT SATURATION

As shown in Figure 18, for the evaluation results of the
system resource content, the analysis is performed from four
aspects: scientific, accuracy, completeness, and uniqueness.
The results show that: 33.2% of the users think that the system
is more in line with science, 20% think that the system is not
very good. For accuracy, 36.16% of the users think that the
accuracy is more in line with historical facts, more than 80%
agree on the accuracy of the designed system. For the integrity
of resources, 40% of the users think that it is complete, and
only 35.5% think that the system is unique but don’t pay
more attention to this based on the perception of the public.
According to the above results, the content satisfaction of the
virtual system resource is high, which is more scientific and
accurate, but the uniqueness of the system needs to be further
improved.

D. INFORMATION PRESENTATION SATURATION

As shown in Figure 19, to present the evaluation results for
the information of the system, the three aspects of interface
diversity, interface aesthetics, and interface quality are ana-
lyzed. The results show that: 37.1% of the users think that
the system has good diversity, which can meet the needs of
different groups of people; for the aesthetics of the interface,
more than 80% think that it is very beautiful and satisfactory,
of which more than 65% think the quality of the virtual
museum is better than other products on the market. Accord-
ing to the above results, the virtual system information is well



presented, but it still needs further improvement in terms of
interface aesthetics and quality.

ability’’, ‘‘using the system can improve the spiritual and
cultural life’’, and ‘‘using the system can be more conducive
to inheriting China Traditional Culture’’. The results show
that nearly one-third of users believe that using this system
can stimulate interest and motivation for learning to some
extent. Among them, 38% of users believe that using the
system can significantly improve their appreciation, 33.8%
believe that using the system can significantly improve their
spiritual and cultural life; another 31.3% believe that using the
system can be more conducive to the inheritance of traditional
Chinese culture. The above results prove that the learning
effect of the virtual system is more obvious.

FIGURE 19. Evaluation results of information presentation saturation.


E. RESOURCE PRESENTATION SATURATION

As shown in Figure 20, for the resource presentation eval-
uation results of the system, the survey is performed from
three dimensions: ease of use, openness, and controllability of
resource presentation. The results show that more than 80%
of the users think that the method of the system is simple
and feasible, the function is more suitable for the public, and
they can master its usage in a short time. Among them, 87%
think that the designed system can be displayed and learned
from multiple aspects so that the openness of the system
is better, while 35% think that the control of the system is
average, this may be because that more functions are needed.
According to the above results, the virtual system learning is
more acceptable to the public, and learners can easily learn
to operate and spread through the Internet, allowing more
people to accept and learn.

FIGURE 20. Evaluation results of resource presentation saturation.

F. LEARNING EFFECT SATURATION

As shown in Figure 21, it illustrates the evaluation results of
the learning effect of the system. B1, B2, B3, and B4 respec-
tively stand for ‘‘using the system can understand painting
knowledge’’, ‘‘using the system can improve the appreciation

IV. DISCUSSION

A. COMMUNICATION VALUE OF THE DIGITALIZED
MUSEUM OF ANCIENT HIGH-IMITATIVE CALLIGRAPHY
AND PAINTING OF QAU

(1) The popularization of communication types: The purpose
of a museum is to provide information to a wide range of
users, including history, humanities, geography, and natural
sciences [23]. According to the elements of communica-
tion, the museum should be the source of information, that
is, the communicator [24], [25]. The information transmis-
sion of traditional museum is realized within the scope of
the museum, and the most information recipients are the
groups, which cannot achieve mass communication. Taking
the visitors who visited the entity Museum of Ancient High-
Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU as an example,
the process of the visit is nothing more than individual visits;
the instructor explains to the individual visitors, which is
exactly the same way that the instructor explains to the group
visitors. These types of forms, according to the classifica-
tion of communication in terms of communication types,
include self-communication, interpersonal communication,
and group communication. However, with the extensive uti-
lization of digital technology in museums, the scope of the
visitor has been greatly expanded and extended to the scope
of the public, which is no longer blocked by the ‘‘walls’’
of the museums. In addition, the communication scope of
collection and display of information in the museum has been



greatly expanded. On the basis of retaining the interpersonal
and group communication functions of physical museums,
the function of mass communication has also been added.
First, the digitalization of museums meets the dynamic infor-
mation needs of the public for cultural heritage protection
and management, which is the function of monitoring; in
addition, it realizes the evaluation and interpretation of cul-
ture, which is the function of publicity and education to the
public, as well as realizing the attributes of the mass media
organization of the museum.

Taking the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy
and Painting of QAU as an example, traditional physical
museum visitors are conducted in the form of individuals or
groups, and the spread of the scope is limited, while the digital
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU has broken through the restrictions of the ‘‘walls’’,
allowing the majority of users to visit the museum at any time
in any place, thereby realizing the mass communication of the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU.

(2) Interactivity in the communication process: The
communication process of most traditional museums is a one-
way flow of information [26]. Such a communication pro-
cess has caused limited communication between the museum
and the visitors. Often, users receive information from the
museum but cannot effectively pass their feedback to the
museum management in a timely and effective manner. Even
if the museum issues questionnaire surveys to the crowds
who come to visit for soliciting the opinions of the visitor,
it will cause the problem of narrow investigation scope. More
seriously, because the form and content of the questionnaire
survey cannot be quickly modified according to changes in
the actual situation, the information returned by the visitors
is also indirect and lagging. During the visit of the Museum
of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU,
the visitor has watched in front of the exhibition board as the
recipient of the information and listened to the explanation of
the instructor. There are few opportunities to give feedback or
to ask questions to the instructor. This type of communication
is a mass communication method that does not have individ-
ual characteristics and lacks pertinence for each individual.
At the same time, because the traditional museum visit model
places the visitor as the absolute receiver of information,
the blind acceptance of information by the visitor will reduce
the visitor’s initiative to receive information.

Due to the openness of time and space, the virtual museum
under digitalization can make the users interact with the vir-
tual museum through mouse clicks and finger touches, as well
as selectively receiving the information of interest according
to the users. Besides, the feedback of information to the
museum realizes the two-way flow of information. Visitors
no longer need to passively receive the information displayed
by the museum in front of them as in the past; instead, they
can choose the desired text and images according to their sub-
jective ideas and real-timely communicate with the museum
about what they are experiencing; so, the initiative of the

visitors is well mobilized, and the efficiency and quality of the
communication are improved. Compared with the traditional
tour of the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy
and Painting of QAU, whether interested or uninterested,
visitors must visit the museum from the beginning to the
ending according to the route of the tour. The final result
is conceivable; the uninterested information is filtered out
by their brains, while the interested information cannot be
received well due to interference from other information. The
effect of the visit will not be good with no doubts. This is not
the case during the visit to the digitalized Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU. Visitors
can choose the information they are interested in to browse
based on their personal preferences and manually filter out
the interference of other information so that the quality of the
information received is improved. At the same time, due to
the manual selection process of the audience, their initiative
has been greatly enhanced.

B. THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF THE DIGITALIZED MUSEUM
OF ANCIENT HIGH-IMITATIVE CALLIGRAPHY AND
PAINTING OF QAU

(1) Digital display function: With the development of com-
puter technology, it has become possible to provide visitors
with a multi-sensory enjoyment of sight and sound through
text, screen images, sounds, and videos, and such a means
has gradually become the mainstream [27]. The Museum
of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU
provides visitors with an unprecedented perception experi-
ence through multimedia forms of graphic images and audios,
allowing visitors to choose their perception method according
to their subjective wishes.

In the traditional display mode of the Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU, the flow of
information is one-way. As the recipient of the information,
the visitors can only accept the information but cannot react
to the museum. Here, the method improves the consensus
and consistent experience between visitors, but weakens the
differentiated perception experience of the visitors. With the
help of digital technology, the QAU Museum of Ancient
High-Imitation Calligraphy and Painting digitally changed
the information and images of the display objects through
the interaction with the digital display objects, resulting in
a change in the meaning of the displayed objects. During
the digital display of the QAU Museum of Ancient Highly
Imitative Calligraphy and Painting, visitors only need a sim-
ple mouse click or keyboard operation to display they are
interested in; also, they can rotate the viewing angle and make
a detailed observation of the display. This is unimaginable
in the traditional museum visits. The interactivity not only
makes the visitors interested in the exhibits but also makes
the virtual display objects have life and constantly changes.

The Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and
Painting of QAU has been greatly extended in space and
time. The first is the expansion of the content of the objects
displayed in time and space dimensions. Because of the



preservation limitations, in the physical Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU, exhibits
have to be locked in the display cabinet. The digital
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU can provide visitors with complete digital images
and attribute information of physical display objects through
virtual technology. In the virtual QAU roaming system, vis-
itors can adjust their perspective and observe the display
objects from multiple angles to observe the parts and details
of the objects so that they can master the connotation infor-
mation and structural information from all angles. Second,
the time and space for visitors to visit the exhibition has
been expanded. Because the digital virtual QAU roaming uses
digital means to copy and spread, visitors no longer need to
rush to the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy
and Painting of QAU exhibition on the ground at a specific
time. In the digital museum, users can visit anytime and
anywhere without any limits.

(2) Digitalized protection function: The Museum of
Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU
have collected more than 100 high-imitative paintings and
calligraphy works printed by Nigensha Japan, including fine
paintings and calligraphy works in Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming,
Qing, and other ancient Chinese dynasties. The collected
works cover three painting subjects of characters, landscape,
and flowers and birds, all of which are master-class fine
works, such as Fan Kuan’s Xi Shan Xing Lv and Li Tang’s Wan
He Song Feng Tu in the Song Dynasty, Huang Gongwang’s
Fu Chun Shan Ju Tu in the Yuan Dynasty, Shen Zhou’s Lu
Shan Gao in the Ming Dynasty, and fine works of famous
ancient Chinese artists Ni Zan, Tang Yin, Shi Tao, and Wang
Yuanqi. These works have been stored in the exhibition hall
for a long time, which may cause damages to some extent.
Digital technology provides a new means and channel to
protect these ancient high-imitative calligraphy and painting
works. Through digital means, the high-imitative calligraphy
and painting works in the QAU museum are digitized. Since
the digitized works can be continuously copied and stored
on the premise of maintaining integrity, the collections in the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU can get rid of the damages caused by the passage of
time and maintain their original appearances for a long time.
Besides, for any building, no matter how large the building
scale is, it will have a corresponding capacity according to its
characteristics. For the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative
Calligraphy and Painting of QAU, the museum management
has to take restrictive measures when the number of tourists
is large to prevent the number of visitors visiting at the
same time from exceeding the upper limit of the daily tourist
volume; however, for ordinary tourists, this delays the visit-
ing time, and they have to spend their time waiting in line
outside the museum. The virtual the Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU relieves
the pressure of tourists to some extent. Due to the infinite
reproducibility of numbers, anyone can visit the Museum
of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU

through the terminal at any time and any place, which has
a good diversion effect for visitors; in addition, the digi-
tal museum can reduce the number of visitors visiting the
physical museum, which is beneficial for protecting and
extending the service life of the QAU Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting.

(3) Digital collection function: The digital collection
includes the collection and preservation of information
related to the works. The digital objects are stored in the form
of data through digital processing, such as the digital shoot-
ing of the works and virtual production of 3D models [28].
In the preservation process of traditional museum exhibits
and related materials, in addition to the tedious process,
it also requires dedicated personnel to integrate and manage
the physical objects. This not only consumes a lot of time,
during which the management personnel need to spend a lot
of energy in the entire management process, but also requires
enough storage space to save these physical exhibits. Taking
the traditional Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligra-
phy and Painting of QAU as an example, the management
of all exhibits in the museum requires staff with professional
management skills, and many such professionals are required.
Even  for the same exhibit, it needs continuous maintenance
and management to understand the latest status of the exhibit
in real-time, which requires a lot of manpower and financial
resources. In addition, all exhibits need to be prepared with
enough space for preservation during the preservation pro-
cess. In this way, a large amount of storage space needs to be
consumed, which means that QAU must have a lot of space
to support the venue.

In terms of digital collections, virtual museums have
advantages that traditional museums do not. Because virtual
museums store information in the form of zero and one data,
it can save a lot of storage space; furthermore, because of
the ease of data maintenance, without human interference,
the data will not be destroyed, so there is no need for special
guards, no time and space restrictions, and no requirements
for long-term storage of information resources, thereby sav-
ing manpower and resources [29]. It is precisely because the
information in the form of data is easy to be operated in
terms of input, query, modification, and deletion that makes
the digital exhibits in the virtual museum easy to be added,
managed, queried, updated, and maintained. Digitally stored
museum exhibit information can be preserved for a long time
and is not easily affected by the environment, ensuring that
the collection can be better collected, reducing the possi-
bility of cultural relics being damaged by natural environ-
ment and objective factors, and keeping the collection longer.
The characteristics of the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative
Calligraphy and Painting of QAU include convenient and
lasting, convenient and fast maintenance, manpower saving,
and material resource saving. Besides, the information of
the collection is not easy to be destroyed. Not only is it
conducive but also counterproductive to the promotion of the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU. In turn, the protection of the Museum of Ancient



High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU promotes
its further development.

C. THE AESTHETIC VALUE OF THE DIGITALIZED MUSEUM
OF ANCIENT HIGH-IMITATIVE CALLIGRAPHY AND
PAINTING OF QAU

When digital technology first appeared, people had no under-
standing of this emerging field, and it was impossible to
realize the immense energy and value contained in it. But as
technology is gradually recognized and mastered by people,
the simple technical level of understanding begins to change
into a higher level of arts integration. But in turn, high-
level artistic aesthetics require a large number of underlying
technologies as support. So, advanced aesthetic requirements
have played a certain role in promoting the development of
technology [30].

The characteristics of aesthetic activities include intuitive-
ness, emotion, and pleasure. These three characteristics are
the advantages of digitalization [31]. The characteristics of
aesthetic activities include intuitiveness, emotion, and plea-
sure. These three characteristics are the advantages of dig-
italization. In terms of digital display, digital technology is
used to display museum information for the visitors. It is
precisely because of this advantage that this display method
is artistically aesthetic. It can convey beauty to the public
and maximize the subjective initiative of the public. As the
application of digital graphics and image technology in the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU, the museum has a strong professionalism and rich
artistic quality at the same time. Since the visual graphic
images are displayed in front of the visitors, the visitors can
judge the beauty and ugliness of the images through their
subjective experiences. Therefore, the process of visiting the
Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting
of QAU is itself an aesthetic process.

V. CONCLUSION

Here, the QAU is taken as the research object. Through
the virtual roaming system design of the venues and
representative exhibition items in the Museum of Ancient
High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU, the virtual
roaming of the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligra-
phy and Painting of QAU is realized in terms of the visual
interface and interactive function development; users can
utilize computer peripheral devices to perform interactive
browsing and access, achieving the spread and display of
multiple multimedia forms from images to videos. A com-
prehensive evaluation from the aspects of resource content,
information presentation, resource presentation, and learning
effect has found that compared with the physical museum, the
digitalized QAU Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Callig-
raphy and Painting has new features of bilateral interactive
display and collaboration of multiple senses in coordination
with display methods. For the collection of exhibits, it has
the characteristics of saving space, damage avoiding, and
easy to query and manage. By displaying the information

through the advantages of graphic images, the recipients of
information can participate in the selection of information
sources according to their aesthetics, which provides a means
for the beautification and display of the museum exhibits.
However, due to the complexity of the virtual roaming of
the building and the artistic features it embodies, as well
as the limited nature of the data, the diversity of the digital
process methods and the difference in the final effect are
understood deeply, as well as the complexity of the artistic
characteristics reflected thereby, which needs to be followed
up and deepened in the future.
