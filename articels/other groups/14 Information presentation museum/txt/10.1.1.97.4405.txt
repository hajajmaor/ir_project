Foreword

I am delighted to provide a foreword for this publication as it brings
together such an interesting and varied collection of articles describing
the latest practical and theoretical work in the exciting new area of
mobile learning. Advances in technologies inevitably bring with them
additional opportunities to facilitate and enrich the experiences of
individual learners. Sometimes, we in education are slow to grasp
those opportunities but I hope that this publication will stimulate
thought about how the explosion of mobile phone and handheld
technology can be exploited to reach out to more and more learners.

In recent years the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has invested
millions of pounds in promoting and facilitating the use of
information and learning technologies (ILT) to support and
enhance teaching and learning in the UK. In the late 1990s the
Further Education Funding Council (FEFC), British Educational
Communications and Technology Agency (Becta) and the

Further Education Development Agency (FEDA, which subsequently
became LSDA) worked together to improve the ILT literacy and skills
of teachers, support staff and managers in further education and
sixth form colleges. The National Learning Network (NLN) has built
upon this platform to maximise the availability and effectiveness

of e-learning in colleges and in the wider post-16 community.

The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and the Department for
Education and Skills (DfES) are working together to give learners
of   all ages e-learning of the highest calibre to support their lives,
extend their choices, enrich their competences and strengthen
their autonomy at home, work and in the community. We intend
progressively to remove barriers to access to lifelong learning,

to enable learners to take full advantage of learning opportunities
regardless of mode and place of study and to promote experimentation
and innovative development.

In 2002 we published the influential report of the Distributed

and Electronic Learning Group (DELG). In the introduction to this
report the chair of DELG, Professor Bob Fryer, observed: ‘Already
many young people are growing up familiar with digital gadgetry
and computerised processes and are skilful in their application,
as a normal part of their lives.’

It is certainly true that many people are familiar and skilful with
mobile phones. In supporting the work of the m-learning project,
which is exploring how mobile learning might attract reluctant
young learners and help improve their life skills, we hope to move
a step closer to the dream of providing any time, anywhere
learning which is consistent with learners’ lifestyles.

I hope you find this publication informative and inspiring.

Introduction

The authors who have contributed to this book are researchers,
developers and practitioners in both educational and commercial
organisations from a number of different countries. They all have
in  common an interest in the new and quickly evolving field of
mobile learning.

The papers are based on presentations given at a very successful
and enjoyable international conference, MLEARN 2003, which
was hosted in London in May 2003 by the Learning and Skills
Development Agency (LSDA). The conference was organised

by LSDA, as the coordinating partner of the m-learning project,
in collaboration with our sister project MOBIlearn.

Some of the papers detail the findings of mobile learning projects,
some are based on desk research and the authors’ attempts to
identify and further develop theory relevant to mobile learning,
and some report work in progress. Work in progress includes
both research and the development of mobile learning materials
and systems.

Many of the papers have been written by colleagues who are partners
in one of the two large mobile learning projects supported by the
European Commission’s Information Society Technologies
programme    – m-learning and MOBIlearn. Further information about
the projects can be found on the project websites at www.m-
learning.org and www.mobilearn.org. Further information on the
progress   of these projects will be reported at the MLEARN 2004
conference in Rome in July 2004, and the conference website can be
found  at www.mobilearn.org/mlearn2004/

Some presenters at the MLEARN 2003 conference were

not able to write a full paper for this book, but a brief summary

of their work can be found in the MLEARN 2003 Book of abstracts
which can be downloaded from the LSDA website at
www.LSDA.org.uk/events/mlearn2003

I hope you enjoy reading the papers in this book and learning
about the innovative and exciting work of the projects described.

Abstract

This paper describes how the m-learning
project is investigating whether the use of mobile
technologies in the hands of young adults (aged
16–24) might engage them in learning activities,
start to change their attitudes to learning and
contribute towards improving their literacy,
numeracy and life chances. The findings of the
research carried out by the Learning and Skills
Development Agency are outlined, together with
its   plans for the major research activity in phase
2 of the project – involving 200 learners in three
European countries.

Keywords:  m-learning,  mobile  phones,
handheld devices, social inclusion, basic skills

1. An important issue for educators

The 1997 International Adult Literacy Survey
(OECD  1997)  found  that  many  developed
countries had ‘functional illiteracy’ rates of 20%
or  more and worse innumeracy. An example of
functional  illiteracy  is  that  if  given  the
alphabetical  index  to  the Yellow pages  (a
directory where local traders can advertise their
services to the public), some 7m adults could
not locate the page reference for plumbers. An
example of innumeracy is that one in four adults
could not calculate the change they would get
from £2 if they purchased a loaf of bread costing
68p and two cans of beans at 45p each (Moser
1999).

In 1999 in the UK one in five adults was found
to have ‘less literacy than is expected of an 11-
year-old child’ (Moser 1999). Two years later UK
government figures revealed that ‘of the

580 000 or so 16-year-olds who leave school
each year, around 150 000 are below Level 1 in
both Maths and English’, where Level 1 is the
level of attainment school pupils are expected
to achieve by age 11.  Furthermore, ‘22% of
these young people do not go on to training or
work after they leave school’ (DfEE 2001).

The  statistics  illustrate  that  this  is  an
intractable  problem  and  we  believe  that
imaginative and innovative approaches are
needed to bring about improvements in learning
such basic skills. The approach of the m-
learning project is to offer small sets of learning
experiences on mobile devices – similar to the
mobile phones which many young people are
comfortable using and enthusiastic about.

2.   Background to the m-learning
project

The m-learning project is a 3-year, pan-
European research and development study with
partners in Italy, Sweden and the UK. Its aim is
to use portable technologies to provide literacy
and numeracy learning experiences for young
adults (aged 16–24) who are not in a full-time
education environment, and to promote the
development  and  achievement  of  lifelong
learning objectives. The m-learning project is
coordinated  by  the  Learning  and  Skills
Development  Agency  (LSDA)  and  project
partners include two commercial companies
(Cambridge Training and Development Limited
in the UK, and Lecando AB in Sweden) and two
university-based  research  units  (Centro  di
Ricerca in Matematica Pura ed Applicata at the
University of Salerno in Italy and Ultralab at
Anglia Polytechnic University in the UK).

mobile learning

The m-learning project has several research
strands. The objectives of phase-one research
activities were to assist the project partners in
selecting appropriate technologies in the rapidly
evolving field of personal information and
communications technologies (ICTs) and to
inform   the design and development of learning
materials.

focusing on different, but complementary,
domains of mobile learning research, relating to:

•mobile phones, their uses and users

•the use of palmtop computers for learning

•  the use of computer/video games for
learning.

At the same time LSDA’s survey of 746 young
adult  mobile  phone  users  across  the  UK
explored users’ attitudes towards their mobiles
and their initial reactions to the idea of a phone-
based game that might help them with their
reading, spelling or maths.

Other research activities by project partners
have included: identifying relevant technologies
and their functionality; standards for learning
materials development and interoperability;
learner and knowledge modelling; small-scale
user trials of learning materials and user
interfaces or microportals.

4.   The findings of the research
reviews

4.1.1  Past research into the impact of
mobile phones and their possible use for
learning

The research review highlighted the universal
spread of the mobile phone. The overwhelming
majority of young adults in our target age group
in our project partner countries (UK, Italy and
Sweden) own mobiles, as can be seen in Table
1 (based on data from 2002). Of course, many
young adults share mobiles, perhaps among
family members or with friends, and so the
actual number of users may be higher than
Table 1 suggests.

Based on Brown and Dhaliwal 2002

Ownership statistics for other countries can
sometimes be surprising. For example, in the
USA, the take-up of mobile phones has been
much slower and only 40% of 15–19 year olds,
and 61% of 20–24 year olds, own mobiles
(Brown and Dhaliwal 2002). On the other hand,
in some developing countries, like Botswana,
US $5 million per month (�4 million per month)
is spent on mobiles, raising concern that this
may divert spending from necessities such as
food and clothing, and also from ‘entertainment’
(Mogapi 2000; quoted in Mutula 2002).

Townsend (2000) states that mobile phones
are now appearing widely in the squatter
communities that surround the cities of
developing  countries,  places  where
conventional fixed-line telephony has never
existed.  It is further suggested by Townsend
that in future the use of ‘smart phones’, which
have voice recognition, will benefit members of
the world population who have no ability to read
and write.

The personal nature of the mobile phone,
together with its constant presence on or about
the user’s person, the types of communication it
enables and its importance to teenage identity
and friendships (Ling and Yttri 1999; Eldridge
and Grinter 2001) all support our belief that its
popularity is not just a short-term fad. The role
of phone calls and messaging in friendship
rituals such as gift giving and sharing (Taylor
and Harper 2002; Bauman 2003) suggests the
mobile phone has potential as a collaborative
learning platform.

Ichinohe and Suzuki (2002) comment that
there are many Japanese websites offering
learning materials to i-mode users (i-mode is a
Japanese mobile internet service). In December
2001, they estimated there were 30 million i-
mode users. Outside Japan, however, it would
appear that the use of mobiles in learning is still



relatively rare and usually occurs as part of
short-term or pilot projects.

There have been a number of instances of
the use of SMS (text messaging) ‘soap operas’
to  encourage  pupils  to  revise  early  for
e x a m i n a t i o n s ,   e g   W A N 2 l r n   ( s e e
www.interactivesolutions.co.uk/sms/sms.htm)
and, more recently, the BBC’s GCSE Bitesize
games as examination preparation that can be
downloaded  to  mobile  phones  ( see
www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize).

Prototypes have been developed for learning
languages which use quizzes, word and phrase
translations,  working  with  a  coach  and
vocabulary work (Regan 2000). Mobile phones
have also been used as the subject of teaching
eg teaching A-level Physics students about how
mobiles work (Edwards 2000) and as a way of
encouraging the creativity of young pupils in art
lessons, eg through designing phone fantasy
sculptures because of their relevance to their life
outside school (Székely 2001).

It is frequently suggested that the use of SMS
may inhibit the learning of correct spelling and
grammar. However, many young people who
would not normally pick up a pen and write
messages are enthusiastic texters, and there
are suggestions that the verbal skills of some
usually reticent teenage boys are improving as
they chat on their mobiles (Plant 2001). Thus
they are uniquely placed to contribute to
improving young people’s literacy – especially
as mobile phones are increasingly being
designed with the extra facilities commonly
found on palmtop computers as well as cameras
and picture messaging. This provides more
opportunities for visual and literary expression.

4.1.2  Past research into the use of palmtop
computers for learning

The distinction between mobile phones and
palmtop computers is becoming less and less
obvious. While more mobile phones now have
Palm-like functionality (eg contacts database, a
calendar, etc), palmtop computers now include,
or  can  be  upgraded  with,  mobile  phone
functionality.  Also  a  number  of  hybrid
phone–palm devices are now available which
combine typical phone and palmtop functionality.
One  result  of  these  developments  is  that
published research about the use of palmtop
computers is increasingly relevant to a project
primarily focused on the potential of mobile
phones.

It has been found by Savill-Smith and Kent
(2003), in a review of the published literature

about the use of palmtop computers for learning
that palmtop computers can:

•assist students’ motivation

•help organisational skills

•encourage a sense of responsibility

•help  support  both  independent  and
collaborative learning

•act as reference tools

•track students’ progress

• deliver assessment.

This review highlights a number of learning
games that have been designed specifically for
palmtops, including the Cooties and Geney™
simulation games. The Cooties game is a virus
simulation  game  for  learning  science  (see
www.goknow.com/Products/Cooties.html),
where students and the teacher use infra-red
beaming to ‘infect’ their personalised coodles
(or pets, akin to the Tamagotchi™ concept).
The  Cooties’  game  has  been  found  to
encourage collaborative and group working and
increase  the  amount  of  writing  produced
(Shields and Poftak 2002). The Geney™ game
(see
http://geney.juxta.com/chi2001_handheld.pdf)
simulates a population of fish representing a
gene pool, and the goal is for students to work
together to produce a fish with certain genetic
characteristics (Danesh et al. 2001). According
to Mandryk et al. (2001), this produces a rich
social interaction which is found to excite and
motivate learners to interact, including those
who were less inclined to do so. Other uses of
palmtops for learning have been: to increase
the amount of children’s reading and writing (eg
the Docklands Learning Acceleration Project
(McTaggart 1997); to help with the collection
and analysis of data for science fieldwork
(Graham  1997);  in  sports  and  physical
education; and the use of reflective logs (often
used in medical education). However, as was
found with the review of the mobile phone
literature, there has been a lack of comparative
research studies, and studies that relate their
work and outcomes to theories of learning.

4.1.3  Past  research  into  the  use  of
computer games for learning

Playing computer games is a popular activity
for many young adults and, increasingly, mobile
phones are incorporating more games. Such
games are often based on early computer
games, eg Snake, which is available on Nokia
phones. It is projected that the value of the
mobile games market in Europe, the USA and
Japan will grow from £73m (�104m) in 2001 to



over £1.4 bn (�2bn) by 2005 (Spectrum Strategy
Consultants/DTI 2002).

Table  2  Engaging  characteristics  of
computer games


To-date,  computer  games  have  been
commonly played on the following delivery
platforms:

•portable, handheld games devices, such as
the Game Boy™

• personal computers (ordinary desktop
computers)

•  specialised games ‘consoles’ (powerful
computers with high-specification graphics

capability for use in homes, eg the Sony
PlayStation2 or Microsoft® Xbox)

•  games machines located in amusement
arcades.

Computer games are also played online via
the internet, on an individual or networked basis,
and on interactive TV (iTV) platforms.

The m-learning project intends to develop
some of its learning materials using a gaming
philosophy to make their use attractive to young
adults.

by  Becta  (2001)  that  the  benefits  of  using
games software in education are: ICT skills
development  (but  this  is  time-consuming)
increased motivation (but games can be too
complex for classroom context); encouragement
of  collaborative learning (but games can be so
engaging that the educational focus is lost); and
the development of thinking skills. Positive side
effects  have  included  increased  library  use
among the learners (but learners may find that
they suffer from inappropriate vocabulary or
reading level to take full advantage of this), and
increased  self-esteem  (although  technical
problems  with  using  computer  games  can
militate against this) and better engagement with
the  content.  Thus,  gaming  can  encourage
thinking,  reflecting  and  creativity.  Becta
suggests areas of further research into the use
of  computer  games,  including  their  use  to
motivate disengaged pupils.

Prensky (2001) has identified a combination
of 12 elements that make computer games
engaging. These are summarised in Table 2.

Adapted from Prensky 2001, pages 106–7

In any game focused on learning, as can be
seen above, Prensky considers that it is the
feedback that encourages learning. Such
feedback  is  a  complex  issue  to  game
designers, as too little or too much can quickly
lead  to a player’s frustration. Examples of
feedback in commercial games are where the
player is constantly learning how the game
works, what the designer’s underlying model is,
how to succeed, and how to get to the next
level and win (eg to get rewards for mastering
something, a prompt to try again, seek help,
etc,  until it is mastered).

In the m-learning project’s early trials of
learning materials, it was generally found that
the  young  adults  who  took  part  had  high
expectations concerning the content and quality
of the computer games. They were enthusiastic
about the use of games but wanted tougher,
more  dramatic,  storylines.  This  was
characterised by one young person saying ‘he
wouldn’t have died if he knew his sums’. These
findings  appear  to  support  Prensky’s
explanation  above  of  why  games  engage
players.  They  also  highlight  one  of  the
dilemmas  facing  the  designers  of  such
computer games, ie the need to balance young
people’s desire for excitement with producing
effective and ethically sound learning materials.
The other major problem faced by anyone



interested in developing computer games for
learning is that users will always compare these
with the entertainment games produced by
commercial companies, with their advantage of
multi-million Euro budgets. Two examples that
give some idea of the scale of costs and
manpower involved are: first Fox (2003) who
states that the average development cost of a
Nintendo GameCube game is 72m yen which
equates to approximately �560 000; second a
Spectrum Strategy Consultants suggestion that
the average development for a premium console
title is in the range of £1–2m (�1.5–2.8m) and
requires a team of at least 20 people working for
18 – 24   months   ( Spectrum   Strategy
Consultants/DTI 2002).

5.   Our findings – the survey

The survey questionnaire was developed by
LSDA to discover:

•how young adults use their mobile phones

•what the future take-up of new services and
facilities on mobile phones and other

technology devices might be

•whether mobile phones were likely to be
used beyond a short-term fad

•whether young adults would be willing to use
their phones for literacy and numeracy

learning.

This survey was not targeted specifically at
the m-learning project’s target audience (ie
disengaged young adults). Instead it  tried to
capture a broad range of responses from young
adults in the target age range of 16–24. The
research  took  place  in  seven  different  UK
locations with sizeable populations of young
adults. It was operationalised in December 2001
and January 2002 at three different venues per
location (shopping, leisure and job/employment
centres) that young people were observed to
frequent  (the  latter  venue  to  capture  the
responses of those young adults who were not
currently employed). The survey included both
open and closed questions designed to capture
participants’ quick responses and also their
further  views  when  appropriate.  All
questionnaires  were  completed  by  the
interviewers  to  ensure  that  completing  the
questionnaire would not be an inhibiting factor to
their  participation.  This  resulted  in  746
completed questionnaires for analysis. Some of
the  key  findings  relating  to  the  research
questions are summarised below:

•How do young adults use their mobile
phones?

Most  young  adults  used  their  phone  for
telephone calls for between 5 and 60 minutes
per day, they sent and received 2 to 10 text
messages per day, and played games for 5 to
30 minutes per day.

•What might be the future take-up of new
services and facilities on mobile phones

and other technology devices?

The most wished-for mobile phone functionality
was music, followed by the radio. There was a
general reluctance to consider a future
purchase of a palmtop computer and the main
explanations included a perception of these as
tools  for business people and concerns about
cost.

•Are mobile phones likely to be used beyond
a short-term fad?

More than three-quarters of the young adults
were not worried about their health and safety
when using a mobile phone, and more than half
considered that having one had changed their
life  (with most of the reasons related to allowing
them to stay in contact with others). An open
response question allowed participants to offer
other comments. Most of these related to
respondents’ perceptions of mobile phones as
handy  or convenient. Other issues were also
raised including the cost of ownership, the
wider societal impact of use, users’ reliance or
dependence on their mobiles, and security
issues. Two examples which indicate the depth
of feeling about using their mobile phones were:

oI couldn’t live without my phone, it’s a part
of my life

and

oPhones are bit like a soap opera – you get
addicted and you can’t wait for the next
soap – you can’t wait for the next call.

•Would young adults be willing to use their
phones for literacy and numeracy learning?


Almost  half  of  respondents expressed  an
interest in using phone-based games to improve
their spelling and reading (49%) and maths
(44%). The greatest interest was expressed by
16–19 year olds and young adults educated to
Levels 2 and 3 (GCSE and A-level, or the
equivalent). Females were more interested in a
game to learn reading and spelling, but no
gender difference was noted for a game to learn
maths. However, many young adults stressed
that learning games must be appealing, relevant
and fun (even addictive in the case of maths) if
they were to sustain interest. This response
suggests that getting the design and content of
learning games right is crucial.

A few also expressed an interest in using
phone-based games for learning a foreign
language or for English as a foreign language.

6.  Further exploration

In the current phase, phase 2 of the project,
we are involving community, voluntary and
education organisations, and the groups of
young adults they support, in further research.
This research will explore:

•how different groups of young adults interact
with, and experience, the learning materials

and systems designed by the project

•  whether their enthusiasm for learning in
general appears to be improved by their

mobile learning experiences

•whether learning gains are made, including
young adults’ perceptions of their own

progress

•different models of learning and support, eg
collaborative learning, individual learning

(with  or  without  peer  support),  online
tutoring, blended learning and stand-alone
units of learning, etc

•  how mobile learning might contribute to
government targets for improving basic skills

and engagement in education and training.

Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of
the phase 2 learner research.


Figure 1 Inter-related aspects to the research activities of the m-learning 
project in phase 2


It will be seen that in Figure 1 we have placed
the learner at the centre of the diagram, as their
learning experiences form the core of this
research (together with the experiences and
perceptions of their tutors, mentors or others
who support them). The three concentric circles
represent the three different stages of the
research. The inner circle relates to trialling the
mobile learning materials and researching
responses to these. The middle circle describes
research into the use of the learning materials
together with a special user interface layer we
call the microportal, or m-portal. The outer circle
includes research involving the integrated m-
learning environment including an intelligent
tutor and a learning management system.
Depending on our development experience, and
the decisions taken on the specific equipment to
be used, the second and third stages in this
process may be merged. The diagram also
indicates that learning materials are being
developed that are designed to assist with
improving literacy and numeracy.

This research activity is being led by LSDA
and will involve 200 learners based in the UK,
Italy and Sweden. In the UK we expect to
involve about 150 learners. In carrying out the
research  we  will  be  collaborating  with

organisations who have established supporting
relationships with groups of young adults in our
target audience of 16–24 year olds who are
disengaged from education and training. The
duration  of  the  involvement  of  each
organisation and each group of learners in the
research will vary within an anticipated range of
1–12 weeks between December 2003 and June
2004. It is hoped that by taking part in the m-
learning project young adults will engage in
interesting and stimulating mobile learning
activities that will start to change their attitudes
to learning. Our learning experiences are also
designed to contribute towards improving their
literacy, numeracy and life skills and thereby
their life chances.

Abstract

Constructing,  evaluating  and  evolving
wireless and e-learning content to meet users’
requirements are some of the challenges
faced by developers of current e-learning and
mobile  learning  systems.  Key  users’
requirements are non-functional requirements
(NFRs).  This  is  because  functional
requirements set out services expected by the
system user, whereas NFRs set out the
constraints of the system and the product and
process standards to be followed. As such,
they play a central role in evaluating the
quality of wireless and e-learning modules.

We  have  developed  a  scheme  for
representing critical NFRs, and applied it to
the domains of mobile e-learning  contents
(MLC) and multimedia educational software
(MES) for validation. Our approach extends
the model for the representation of design
rationale  by  making  the  evaluation  goals
explicit and providing the means to improve
the quality of e-learning content (especially
mobile learning content). Finally, further issues
for research are highlighted, including the
need to relate NFRs to system architectures.

Keywords: non-functional requirements
(NFRs), mobile learning contents (MLC),
multimedia educational software (MES),
system architectures

1. Introduction

It is widely recognised that non-functional
requirements (NFRs)  are  crucial  in  the
development of software and that different
architectural choices can have a different
impact on the quality of the final system
(Arango and Prieto-Diaz 1991; Devanbu et al.,
1991; Avellis 2000). However, there is a
perceived gap in the way that current software

development methods build on, and keep track
of, the links between such requirements,
especially NFRs, and system architectures in
constructing and evolving complex systems.

In this paper, we will provide a map to help
identify the explicit links between the NFRs
and mobile learning systems, and use this
map to consider the ‘value’ of the system and
incrementally  evaluate  the  NFRs  during
software development.

We focus on the analysis of, and reasoning
about, the process of building a ‘value’ model
of  a software system by explicitly representing
NFRs. The techniques and representations in
the paper are then demonstrated on two
application domains. Mobile learning systems
represent a broad class of software systems
with complex characteristics that tend to make
evaluation difficult, because there are no
existing  comprehensive  frameworks  for
formative  evaluation  in  the  mobile
environment.  The  effectiveness  and
pedagogical soundness are, for example, very
important to evaluate in mobile contents. Quite
apart from the intrinsic difficulty in assessing
these characteristics, the novelty of mobile
application makes this a very hard task. The
educational potential of mobile learning
contents, both as a learning and teaching tool,
is widely acknowledged, and various initiatives
have been undertaken to encourage the
integration  of  educational  multimedia
resources in school practice (Avellis and
Capurso 1999a). The aim of this paper is to
address the main issues of evaluation of
mobile learning content and multimedia
educational software and to tackle the problem
of evaluating NFRs by developing a scheme
for annotating NFRs to the architectures.

Section 2 describes the context of the
problem.

Section 3 identifies the features of the
software domain and points out the needs in
evaluating  mobile  learning  contents.  The
evaluation  criteria  are  developed  in  the
framework of ERMES (EuRopean Multimedia



Educational Software network). This is an
ESPRIT  project  (Avellis  and  Ulloa 1997),
which  is  the  integrated  programme  of
information  technologies  managed  by  the
Directorate  General  for  Industry  of  the
European Commission.

Section 4 introduces the annotation scheme
to represent NFRs. This is the selected
scheme of NFR representation, which is a
process-oriented, rather than product-oriented,
representation.

Finally,  the  conclusions  identify  further
research issues in building links between
NFRs and system architectures.

2. Background

The functional viewpoint is not the only
design dictum in engineering. Petroski’s 1994
refutation of the design dictum ‘form follows
function’ applies to software systems as well
as any other complex systems. The main
developments in software engineering have
centred on the functional and object-oriented
perspective.  This  is  mainly  because  the
functionality of the system offers an explicit
level of representation of system capabilities,
and  the  object-oriented  representations
provide a suitable basis for understanding the
application  concepts  as  the  represented
objects, which can be easily mapped with the
real world objects.

This perspective has been pursued for
many years. One of its main advantages is
that it provides the means to localise the
effects  of  functional  changes  in  system
architecture. It also restricts the impact and
propagation of changes, so that the changes
which take place in an aspect of the system
are ‘mapped’ to the changes to other aspects
of the system (Avellis 1992; Avellis et al.
1991).

We use the terms ‘aspect’ or ‘view’ of a
system to mean a set of abstractions that
provides  us  with  one  of  many  possible
characterisations of a software system. A
‘model of view’ captures the semantics used
by  that  view  (Avellis  1990;  Avellis  and
Borzacchini 1994). In the literature on reverse
engineering, a ‘view’ is often a structural view
that contains information about the structure of
the product. For instance, the Software Re-
engineering Environment (SRE) of CSTaR-
Arthur  Andersen  (Kozaczynsky  and  Ning
1989) stops at the level of identifying generic
programming  plans  well  before  identifying
application-specific knowledge. One of the
consequences  of  not  having  application-
specific  views  of  the  system  is  that  the

maintainer has to compute their own complex
mapping between the description of a change
and the part of the system to be changed,
where most changes are expressed in terms
of  the  vocabulary  of  application  domains
(Arango  and  Prieto-Diaz  1991).  The
‘understandability’ issue (Corbi 1989) – that is
grasping  the  relationships  between  the
different views of a software system and their
interconnections  –  relates  to  the  built-in
limitation of human beings in dealing with
large-scale complex objects. The structure of
software,  unlike  that  of  buildings  or
automobiles, is hidden and the only external
evidence we have of the software is related to
its behaviour. This ‘phenomenon of invisibility’
has  been  highly  emphasised  for  many
systems in the research literature (Devanbu et
al. 1991).

There is, thus, a need to develop richer
models for capturing and analysing NFRs in
software engineering. However, this is not a
simple enterprise, as examples of difficult
tasks include:

•choosing an architecture to satisfy some
NFRs

•evaluating the impact of a change of NFRs
on the system structure

•modifying the architecture

•  evaluating  NFRs  during  system
development.

One open problem in our research is to
map the NFRs to architectures to analyse the
impact  of  changing  the  NFRs  on  the
architecture.

Another   open   i ssue   concerns
understanding  how  the  prioritisation  and
evolution of NFRs affect the requirements’
traceability problem and choices of software
architecture.  Requirements’  traceability
(Finkelstein  1991)  refers  to  the  ability  to
describe and follow the life of a requirement,
both forwards and backwards through the
design process. A lack of a common definition
of requirements’ traceability (purpose-driven
versus  solution-driven  versus  information-
driven  versus  direction-driven)  has  been
detected by Gotel and Finkelstein (1996); the
requirements’  traceability  problem  was
perceived not to be uniform due to the diverse
definitions and several fundamental conflicts.

The need for improved requirements’
specification traceability is evident from the
literature (Harandi and Ning 1988). NFRs have
yet  to be incorporated at the core of product
and  process  specification,  design,
implementation techniques and tools. So
progress  in this area has been limited.



Software  quality  is  attracting  more  and
more attention in software engineering for two
reasons: on the technical side, it is usually not
clear to those involved in the development
how to measure the various quality criteria on
a day-to-day basis (ie formative analysis), nor
how to achieve them and measure them on
completion  (summative  analysis).  On  the
customer’s  side,  the  issue  is  simply  not
knowing  what  to  ask  for.  To  this  end,  a
distinction  has  been  made  between  basic
quality factors, such as functionality, reliability,
ease  of  use,  economy,  safety,  and  extra
quality factors, such as flexibility, repairability,
adaptability, understandability, documentation
and  enhanceability.  The  latter  are  quality
factors related to the external, or observable,
quality  of  a  piece  of  software  and  are
particularly important in the world of e-learning
where technical strategies are emerging in
parallel  with  educational  and  pedagogical
strategies. They are also important in the
framework  of  mobile  learning,  where  the
constraints  of  mobile  devices  and  the
supported software are very important for
delivering effective contents, in addition to
mobile quality factors identified so far such as
accessibility,  navigation,  presentation  and
system user operation.

However,  it  is  important  to  grasp  the
internal quality of a system. Ultimately, the
external quality of a system depends on its
internal   quality.   For   example,   the
enhanceability of a system is directly related to
how well structured the internal design is, ie
the size, definition and relationships between
modules  and  subsystems.  Internal  quality
factors include completeness, consistency,
parsimony, traceability, rationality, structure,
paradigm,  and  quality  of  algorithms  and
representations, as well as understandability
and  documentation.  The  nature  of  these
factors is not well understood, which is why we
propose to research how to evaluate quality
factors in wireless and e-learning modules,
and apply the research results to several
domains  and  scenarios  to  validate  the
scheme.

This will produce an integrated set of mobile
learning training modules, and an analysis and
assessment  of  evaluation  criteria  to
understand their requirements for advanced
mobile and wireless technologies. To this end,
we will collaborate with current standardisation
working groups, especially the evaluation and
assessment of NFRs of mobile learning and e-
learning modules.

The current industry standards such as
Aviation  Industry  CBT  Committee  (AICC),
Instructional  Management  System  (IMS),

Dublin  Core  Metadata  Initiative  (DCMI),
Institute  for  Electrical  and  Electronic
E     n g i n e e r i n g / L e a r n i n g    T e c h n o l o g y
Standardization  Committee  (IEEE/LTSC),
Information   Society   Standardization
System/Learning  Technology  Workshop
(CEN/ISSS  LTWS),  Alliance  of  Remote
Instructional  Authoring  and  Distribution
Network for Europe (ARIADNE), PROmoting
Multimedia access to Education and Training
in EUropean Society (PROMETEUS) have
already addressed the problem of metadata
tagging of educational resources to allow
easier access and retrieval through e-learning
systems.   Further   improvements   in
standardisation  could  be  achieved  by
extending the NFRs (eg target delivery device)
to include the set of characters currently
adopted to describe and classify learning
modules. This will result in an increased
capability of the user to assess the suitability
of  selected educational material for a specific
application environment (eg mobile learning).

3. Evaluation of mobile learning
c o n t e n t s   a n d   m u l t i m e d i a
educational software

Mobile e-learning is relatively new, so we
are only beginning to see the potential of
mobile devices in training and performance
support.

Mobile devices are small, portable and
compact. They can often fit in a pocket or
purse. Unlike laptop computers, which are
expensive, heavy and power-hungry, mobile
devices are relatively low-cost, lightweight,
and some work for a long time on an electrical
charge  or  using  a  couple  of  standard
disposable or rechargeable batteries.

The  small  screen  size  of  mobile
devices  (an  NFR)  makes  some  people
question their worth as e-learning delivery
tools. Some of these devices have good audio
capability, allowing students to listen to a
narrated lecture, rather than read material on a
small screen. However, some critics do point
to the restricted input capabilities (another
NFR) of some of these devices, questioning
students’ ability to enter large amounts of text
into a device to take notes or answer an
essay-type question. Many of these devices
are, however, extremely adaptable (again, an
NFR) and can be attached to a full-size folding
keyboard that makes entering large amounts
of information every bit as fast (another NFR)
as it is with a conventional computer.



3.1 Mobile e-learning in practice

Mobile e-learning is currently in its
infancy. Although many experts in the field see
great potential for the use of mobile devices in
e-learning,  there  are  presently  very  few
successful implementations on which to base
a study of best practice.

Because of this, and the fact that
some  mobile  devices  are  similar  in
functionality to conventional computers, it is
only natural that the first generation of mobile
e-learning  content  will  closely  resemble
conventional  e-learning,  presented  on  a
smaller screen.

As mobile devices evolve and people
discover new ways in which the functionality of
mobile devices can be applied to training,
mobile  e-learning  will  probably  become
increasingly different from conventional e-
learning; no longer a miniaturised version of it.
Internet-connected phones may be applied to
mentoring and used to register students on
courses and pay their fees, as well as present
training content through the use of audio.

Another development may be content
development tools that will provide the ability
to publish learning content adaptively to a wide
range of mobile devices. In addition, the
student may well have control over reading or
listening  to  the  content  using  voice-
synthesised XML technologies.

Since mobile e-learning technology is so
immature,  there  are  presently  more
possibilities relating to what could be done
with this technology than concrete examples.
But  with  the  number  of  mobile  devices
predicted  to  surpass  the  number  of
conventional computers for web access in the
near future and with bandwidth for mobile
devices predicted to increase dramatically in
the short term, mobile e-learning appears
certain to become an important part of training
in the future.

Many national and international activities in
mobile  learning  contents  (MLC)  and  in
multimedia  educational  software  (MES)  in
general are currently partially funded by the
European Commission, involving private and
public sector organisations (Avellis and Fresa
1999). In this context, the need for educational
multimedia for vocational training purposes is
widely  recognised.  However,  users  of
educational  multimedia  cannot  appraise
educational resources because they are not
able  to  evaluate  their  characteristics,
potentialities and limits (Avellis and Capurso
1999a).

3.2 Evaluation issues

The reason it is not easy to carry out a
critical  evaluation  of  mobile  educational
multimedia  is  that  these  resources  are
relatively new compared to traditional print-
based learning materials. Most people are still
not used to handling them nor aware of their
educational potential. Educational multimedia
software has an additional intrinsic complexity
because it is a type of software that runs on a
computer and also an educational resource.
Evaluating both these aspects is very different
from  evaluating  a  book  or  any  traditional
educational  resource  because  of  the
interleaving of the two aspects: software and
learning resource. The distinction between
software and supporting learning is blurred
because of the way the application runs, which
affects its educational effectiveness, and the
educational  purpose,  which  underlies  the
design  of  the  software.  Therefore,  both
aspects must be carefully considered during
the  evaluation.  However,  it  is  difficult  to
develop a pre-defined set of standards against
which the educational value of the software
can be defined, because it is not possible to
define  a  unique  and  general  instructional
approach. Thus the mobile educational value
of a piece of software is very difficult to define
in practice (Avellis and Capurso 1999b). The
evaluation  methodology  adopted  in  the
ESPRIT project ERMES (Avellis and Ulloa
1997) consists of identifying aspects of the
object under evaluation, and then defining
quality indicators in relation to these aspects.
Defining the object of evaluation is a key step,
because it suggests the evaluation criteria to
be  used  (Ulloa  1998).  We  group  the
characteristics  of  multimedia  educational
software under the following four evaluation
categories:

•  educational features

•  technical features

•aspects relating to the ease of use
(usability)

•aspects relating to the content.

Each one of these categories has been
further divided into sub-categories. For
example, educational features can be divided
into target users, pedagogical characteristics,
instructional support materials, and so on.
That  means  that  when  evaluating  the
educational features of an MLC or MES, the
aspects relating to the target users, the
pedagogical characteristics, the instructional
support materials, and so on, all have to be
taken into account.



MES  is  a  computer  program,  which
performs a specific educational task. The
multimedia component can be identified in the
use of a variety of media to deliver instruction
or support for the learning activities. MES is
also  characterised  by  the  presence  of
interactive components, which should enable
the user to control the learning environment.

Features of mobile learning contents (MLC)
include the:

•content to be taught

•delivery media used to provide information

•user interface the way the educational
software presents itself to the user;

interaction devices by which the user
interacts  with  the  computer,  making
choices,  answering  questions  or
performing activities, and is provided with
feedback to each response

•instructional strategy adopted

•access which refers to the navigational
paths available to the user to reach the

needed content

•navigation allowing the user to go from
one piece of content to another

•presentation which can provide guidelines
for defining the visual communication

strategies  or  presenting  the  content,
navigation strategies and operation to the
user

•user operation those operations that are
visible to the users and the only ones the

user must be aware of

•

4.  A  scheme  for  critical  NFR
representation

Techniques are needed to express NFRs,
which include quality requirements (Finkelstein
1994).  This  underlines  the  centre  of  the
development process, the ‘generation of a
value model’ such as is used in classical
engineering  disciplines  (Finkelstein  and
Finkelstein 1983). A key component of the
system development process is achieving a
model  of  what  is  valued  in  the  resulting
system. Using this view, quality characteristics
are not externally imposed on a development
process but ‘constructed’ within it. The scheme
developed to express NFRs is based on the
work  done  by  Kunz  and  Rittel  (1970),
particularly in the area of design rationale
(Potts and Bruns 1988). We also take into
account the ‘issue-position-arguments’ model
(Conklin and Begeman 1988). In our scheme,
an ‘issue’, that is a problem to solve, is an
‘NFR,  or  quality  characteristics/sub-
characteristics to evaluate’. An ‘argument’, that
is, a supporting justification of the issue, is a
procedure that helps to determine which
design alternative to choose to implement in
the related NFR. Finally, a ‘position’ that is a
solution to the problem, is either a ‘statement’
of the NFR, which gives a quality goal to be
supported  by  the  final  design,  or  ‘design
alternatives’. A statement is an ascertainable
property (possibly measurable) characterising
NFRs. The set of links is given in Figure 1.

system operation that are not visible to the

users, but are essential in building user
operation (Avellis and Capurso 1999a;
UWA Consortium 2002).


Figure 1 Non-functional requirements representation scheme


It is important to underline that the statement
contains measurable elements by which the
NFR can be ‘constructed’ in software systems.
It is a procedure that applies to different
architectural choices. In this way we relate
NFRs to architectures, by linking statements
and different system architectural choices.

We have enhanced the representation of
NFR with quality function deployment (QFD)
features.

Since the late 1960s Mizuno and Akao (1978)
have established a new systematic method of
design-oriented approaches to ensure that
customer needs drive the product design and
production process. They developed a method
called ‘quality deployment and/or quality function
deployment’ (QD/QFD). We have enhanced
the  scheme  of  NFR  representation  by
introducing the context of evaluation and
weights to the links as follows.

To be assured that we will achieve a
particular software quality characteristic it is
helpful to associate it with some activities within
the software evaluation and development process.
Activity is the evaluation and/or implementation
activity  of  the  quality  characteristic  that
provides the context of evaluation. A quality
characteristic is obtained in a strong/medium/
weak/negative way as a result of performing
an activity.

In a quality-function-deployment (QFD)
style we attach some weights – strong/
medium/weak/negative – to this link, to let the
end  users  (teacher,  trainers,  students,
administrators) assign a weighted value to the
characteristic of the system under evaluation.

Although a quality characteristic can be
constructed independently of the description of
the development process of a product, it is
useful  to  link  the  product  and  process

descriptions to the quality characteristics.
Avellis (2000) provides insights into how to
relate this process view to a product view, by
introducing the role played by the architecture
of   a software system and relating it to the NFRs.

Here are two examples of the application of
the scheme above to MLC and MES.

An NFR related to a MLC could be: ‘the
MLC should fit the subject/topics and learning
objectives of my course’.

The activity related to this example is to:
‘evaluate the educational aim of the MLC
package’, which strongly achieves the quality
characteristics’ ‘educational features’.

‘Educational features’ quality characteristics
have several sub-characteristics to be taken
into account, such as ‘instructional character-
istics’, which suggest by their requirement
statement that ‘appropriateness of learning
objectives are suitable for the age and
competence of target users’ and this is
measured by a procedure to ‘verify that the
content and learning objectives are consistent
with the national curricula requirements’.

The second example is the NFR ‘the MES
package should be easy to operate’.

The activity related to this is ‘understanding
the usage of a MES package’, which achieves
in medium form the quality characteristics of
‘usability’.

This in turn can be further specialised into
the sub-characteristics ‘ease of use’, which is
suggested by the requirements’ statement ‘the
way software operates’ and several procedures
are used to measure usability: ‘What are the IT
skills required to operate the software? Is on-
screen help available? Are directions clear and
accurate? Are directions available at all times?
Is the management of assessment instruments
easy?’



5. Conclusions and further research

This paper presents work in progress to
improve the current Evaluation Tool based on
the framework of the ESPRIT project ERMES.
The key issue is how to incorporate in the tool
the scheme to annotate NFRs to MLC and
MES.

Further research is needed in this context
on, for example, how to annotate NFRs to
architectures.

A system quality attribute (ie the NFR) is
largely  permitted  or  precluded  by  its
architecture.  The  motivation  for  software
architecture  is  to  have  a  basis  for
understanding and standardising systems and
their components.

Software has yet to achieve the level of
reuse  realised  by  hardware  disciplines.
Although software is easy to reproduce, its
variations  are  much  more  difficult  to
standardise, identify and control. Although a
universal reuse solution remains elusive, great
improvements have been made by focusing on
well-defined areas of knowledge or activity
domains  (Arango  and  Prieto-Diaz  1991).
Architectures provide a means for structuring
knowledge of the system within a domain,
including their requirements. The possibilities
for reuse are greatest when the specifications
are the least constrained at the architectural
level.

Reuse is normally considered only at the
implementation phase. This practice limits
reuse to fine-grained modules at best, and
fails to allow for broader use of assets at a
subsystem or higher level, by neglecting to
plan at the early stages of development.

In this paper, we have focused on setting
down a process where argument on the quality
of an MLC and MES is considered on the
basis of identified NFRs, and have developed
some case studies to evaluate the process
critically.

A follow-up research result project will
develop an evaluation tool to help not only
MES users but also MLC users to choose
educational software of high quality, suitable
for their needs and valuable as an educational
resource to integrate into their own courses or
current curriculum based on the selection of
NFRs.

A  further  aim  is  to  research  and
demonstrate innovative mobile contents for
training in the IT and education sectors, and to
evaluate the requirements, especially NFR, of
e-learning modules for mobile applications and
services. The wireless e-learning solution will
focus on the representation of mobile learning

objects that suit the mobile delivery media,
and on methodologies for adapting MES to
mobile learning environments.

Abstract

Mobile learning is an emerging paradigm
that has yet to be clearly defined. To better
understand the nature of mobile learning we
propose a multi-dimensional learning space
model that can be extended as new
technologies and new ways of using
existing technologies are developed. The
potential use of a specific technology for a
particular type of learning within the space
is evaluated by using the quality function
deployment (QFD) set of tools. It is hoped
that  the model will help to identify and
classify types of learning facilitated by
mobile environments and to explore
particular combinations of learning and
technology.

Keywords: learning space, mobile
technology, quality function deployment,

1. Defining the problem

One of the motivating factors for this
paper is the observation that there are many
possible technologies that can be readily
adapted  to  support  mobile  learning.  This
raises the question of how we can select the
technology  and  whether  the  selected
technology is sufficient for the purpose to
which it will be put. If the technology is not
sufficient,  do  we  need  to  design  new
technologies?

Traditionally this question has been
answered in one of two ways: either by asking
potential users to indicate their requirements
and seeking to select technology that can
match these requirements or by developing or
modifying technology and then using this to
run user trials.

Both  approaches  have  proved
successful, but both suffer from problems. The
latter requires the development of kit, which
means that certain design decisions need to
have been made to support the development
process;  which  could  mean  that  design
decisions have been motivated, or at least
influenced by, the capability of the available
technology rather than the requirements of
potential users. The former raises the problem
of  relating  user  requirement  to  system
specification. For example, how do we know
that a given set of user requirements will be
met by the functions of particular products? Of
course the answer to this question is simply
that we ‘know’ whether requirements and
functions match and that, consequently, we
can perform a simple match between these
concepts.

However, simply matching a set of
user requirements with a set of functions does
not lead to a rigorous and auditable process.
Furthermore, it is likely that the relationship
between products, requirements and functions
will be complex and that this complexity might
be distorted by using so straightforward a
subjective matching.

The z axis illustrates specific instances of technology that could be employed 
in mobile
learning, ie, PDA = personal digital assistant; wearables = wearable computers; 
MMS =
multimedia messaging service; SMS = short message service; laptop = laptop 
computer.


Figure 1 presents a schematic of the
possible relationship between a particular set
of requirements, ie ‘type of learning’, a set of
functions  that  could  be  supported  by
technology, and a set of technologies. This
figure is not a graph showing real values;
rather  it  is  intended  to  indicate  that  the
relationship between requirement and function
is probably mediated by the technological
platform used. The idea is that a change in
one aspect of Figure 1 will deform the shape
not only locally but also globally. Changing the
applicability of ‘context’ for the Personal Digital
Assistant  (PDA)  to  type  of  learning,  for
example  from  curriculum-supported  to
serendipitous,  will  not  simply  result  in  a
lowering of all scores for the PDA; rather other
components might increase or simply remain
at the same level. The point is that we can
assume  non-linear  relationships  between
functions and devices.

The x and y axes of Figure 1
represent types of learning and supporting
functionality. Previous work into everyday
learning proposed that learning could be
divided into projects (long-term learning

behaviour, eg completing a module or course
in a particular topic); episodes (medium-term
learning behaviour that may be a subset of a
project, eg attending a lesson on a particular
topic); activities (short-term learning
behaviour,  eg acquire information to find one’s
way from hotel to conference hall). It should be
apparent that the requirements to support
each  type of learning behaviour would differ.

The functionality in Figure 1 is based on
some of the key issues that are important for
mobile learning: the device must be able to:

•respond appropriately to changes in
the learner’s context

•manage presentation of information
effectively

•assist the learning in the
management of learning

•support communications while the
learner is mobile and when the

learner is in different locations.

The z axis of Figure 1 represents a set of
possible technologies that might be employed
for mobile learning.



2. Quality function deployment

A challenge, therefore, is how to
capture the essentially non-linear relationship
between functions offered by devices and the
applicability of those devices to specific types
of learning. In this paper we explore the
potential of quality function deployment as a
mechanism by which the relationships can be
captured and examined.

According to Zultner (1993), the main
purpose of QFD is as an aid to ‘preventing
dissatisfaction by having a deeper
understanding of stated requirements and
implied customer needs, and then deploying
these expectations downstream in order to
design value into the system’.

In broad terms, QFD can be thought of
as a collection of methods that allows analysts
to link the functionality of a particular product
(or class of products) to customer
requirements. The approach is typically used
in industries that are seeking to reduce ‘lead-
time’ and create rapid response to changing
market demands, such as the automotive
industry. However, there is a growing interest
in the use of QFD as a method for
requirements engineering (MacCaulay 1996).

There are several approaches to QFD,
but it is generally applied in one of four
phases: product planning, parts deployment,
process and control planning, production
planning. Of particular relevance to this paper
is   the set of techniques that are applicable to
product planning; in particular, the use of the
‘House of Quality’ (see Figure 2) as a means
of representing the relationship between
product functionality and user requirements.

3. Defining user requirements

For QFD, one can consider user requirements
to take three forms, as described below.

Normal requirements: These are elicited
from the customer, perhaps through market
survey techniques such as interviews or focus
groups. They are ‘normal’ in the sense that
they represent requirements about which the
majority of customers express an opinion.

Expected requirements: There are some
requirements that might ‘go without saying’;
they seem obvious or can be carried forward
from previous studies. However, it is important
to ensure that these are represented in the
analysis.

Exciting requirements: There are some
requirements that may neither be stated by
customers nor defined as expected
requirements,  but which represent that ‘wow
factor’   in product design. Often these
‘requirements’ are created by the design team
and  then assessed through presenting the
design back to potential customers.

From initial work into mobile learning,
we propose the following shortlist of normal
and expected requirements. This set of
requirements has been elicited from informal
discussions with people involved in education
and technology development. It is not intended
to be exhaustive but provides a useful starting
point for discussion and demonstration of the
QFD method:

•adapt functionality for learner
characteristics and learning context

•discover, access, evaluate, store, retrieve
learning objects

•monitor, utilise, evaluate learning
outcomes

•assist in the recovery of breakdowns and
errors during and due to learning

•support the learner’s mobility.

4. Defining functionality

In Figure 1 four aspects of supporting
functionality were presented: context;
presentation; management; communications.
These aspects reflect groups of functions that
are important for mobile learning. Each aspect
can be broken down further into specific
components, as described below.

Context: It is anticipated that an effective
mobile learning application will be able to
model and respond to changes in the learner’s
context (both in terms of changes in situation,
location, time, etc and in terms of changes in
the learner, ie developments of the user
model). In addition to allowing changes in
response, context can also be used to manage
the presentation of information and can
support memory, through the recall of context.
Finally, context can be used to provide
suggestions for activity to the learner.

Presentation: As mobile learning might
involve a combination of devices, for example
a mobile telephone and a PDA, so the manner
in which information is prepared for
presentation to the user will need to adapt.

The notion of an adaptive interface also calls
to mind the question of modifying information
presentation on the basis of ‘context’. Finally,
we  have been exploring the use of overlaying



computer-generated images, ie augmented
reality, as an aid to exploring and receiving
information about exhibits in galleries.

Management: The manner in which a person
is expected to learn can be influenced by the
type of learning they are following, ie project,
episode or activity, as well as by the
curriculum  that is relevant to learning about
specific subjects. Furthermore, it is necessary
to check that learning is being effective, for
example through testing learned information.

Communications:With the rise of 3G and
related mobile multimedia communications
technology, it is possible to send all manner of
data  to handheld devices. Thus, one aspect of
communications relates to whether the content
will need to be sent as text, picture or video.

Another aspect is whether the learner requires
two-way communication, for example in the
form of a voice or video link with a ‘teacher’.

5. Building a ‘House of Quality’

Figure 2 illustrates the ‘House of Quality’
that can be developed using the requirements
and functionality reported in Sections 3 and 4.
There are five stages to producing the House
of Quality.

Stage 1: The user requirements are ranked
(with the highest number reflecting the highest
rank). The ranking involved six people,
working in the Educational Technology
Research Group, ranking the requirements.

The median ranks were then taken (in the
case of a tie, we placed the requirement with
the smallest spread on a higher ranking).

Stage 2: The requirements are mapped onto
each function. The scoring system uses a 9-
point scale. Thus, 0 means that there is no
possible association between a function and a
requirement. A score of 1 indicates a possible
association, while 3 indicates a definite but
weak association, and 8 indicates a strong
association. The mapping of requirement to
function was performed by two of the authors.
It was felt that while we could have called on
the people who had ranked the requirements,
for illustration purposes two people could
produce a reasonable pattern of data.

Typically, mapping is performed by
multivariate statistical analysis and relies on
data generated by several judges. However,
mapping can be a useful exercise in itself,
particularly if most of the design team is
involved;  the exercise of mapping requirement
to function allows design assumptions to be
brought out into the open and discussed.

Stage 3: The weighting for each function is
calculated. Again, calculation is typically
performed statistically. However, we use a
simple manual technique (reported by
Bergquist and Abeysekara 1996) which allows
a reasonable calculation of weighting to be
performed quickly. For each cell in the table ie
each value from the mapping, multiply the rank
of the user requirement for that row with the
mapping score. Repeat this calculation for
each cell in a column until you have produced
a sum for the column. Thus for column one,
the weighting is:
(8x3)+(4x1)+(3x1)+(7x0)+(6x8)+(1x1)+(2x1)+(
3x5) = 97.

Stage 4: Creating the ‘roof’ of the House of
Quality, ie the triangular apex on Figure 2. The
roof represents the associations between each
function, for example perhaps all functions
associated with communication can be linked.
The idea is that if one makes a change to one
function, then this change will also affect
associated functions.

Stage 5: The final stage is to define evaluation
criteria. In this stage, one can define criteria
for evaluating the functions perhaps by
defining appropriate technical tests, and for
evaluating user requirements perhaps by
defining appropriate user trials. This is useful
in  that it allows the design team to focus on
evaluation at an early stage in the design
process  and provides an opportunity to
determine acceptable ‘targets’ for
performance.

6. Conclusions

From the analysis using QFD, shown in Figure
2, three levels of attention can be proposed to
be given to the design project, that is, the
effort needed to develop a particular function
given these user requirements:

•primary attention: peer-to-peer,
annotation, curriculum management,

possible to consider which functions are
essential to support user requirements, and
which are less important. Such an evaluation
can be very useful in the design process in
that it can helps to determine the relative effort
needed to support and develop each function.

requirements against the assumed
functionality     of the technology that is being
developed. By exploring this relationship, it is

This paper describes how self-produced
videos, made with a digital video camera and

1. Introduction

This paper discusses peer-to-peer learning
augmented by mobile IT. The IT concept has
been developed and implemented to support
informal learning between colleagues at an
Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It is based on viewing

the staff as peers in a learning process where
many communicate with many, and where they
produce learning material (short videos) for
each other. The paper has four sections. First,
various views on learning are described to
frame our research. Second, the research
project, the resulting mobile IT concept and the
design process that brought it about are
described. Third, two examples are discussed.
One shows how the production of learning
videos can result in learning for the people
involved; the other shows how the use of
mobile computers with self-produced videos
augments peer-to-peer learning. In the last
section the results are summarised.

2. Peer-to-peer learning

The  term  peer-to-peer  arrived  in  the
computing field during 2000, as the music-
sharing application called Napster changed the
network model of the internet. Instead of using
home  computers  to  browse  the  web  and
exchange e-mails, computers could connect to
each other directly, form groups and collaborate
to become user-created search engines and
file-systems. Content, choice and controls given
to the users are important in peer-to-peer
applications. In peer-to-peer web applications,
the computers are viewed as peers in a larger
network of cooperating computers (Oram et al.
2001). Our research is based upon viewing the
staff in a work-setting as peers in a learning
process where many communicate with many.

Research about learning has traditionally
focused on issues related to schools and other



educational institutions. Learning is primarily
seen as a cognitive process within the individual
pupil, initiated by the teacher who decides which
learning materials and didactical means to use.
The teacher is in charge of the learning situation
and is the mediator of pre-set content. In short,
the traditional learning scheme focuses on one-
to-many communication and views learning as
knowledge or information processing that can be
decontextualised and explained using, for
instance,  words and images (Meier 1997).

Ingela Josefson (1988, 1995) has conducted
research on the training of nurses. Two
irreconcilable traditions of learning are found to
dominate. On the one hand, there is the
scientific model, where the theories of learning
are based on cognitive science. On the other
hand, there is the apprenticeship model, which
focuses on qualities that cannot be expressed in
language. In the development of the nurses'
profession the latter tradition is attacked while
the  first is pleaded for. This is explained by the
aim of giving care a higher status in the society.
Josefson  emphasises  that  basing  the
development of IT-technology on the scientific
model might have unfortunate consequences as
it  undermines  knowledge  gained  from
experience.

Our research contradicts the traditional
learning scheme and emphasises, more in line
with Josefson, practice-based learning. We
focus on informal learning, where colleagues
communicate with each other, and what is to be
learned  is not set in advance. Instead, the
learning material is produced when needed by
the staff themselves.

Schön's (1987) understanding of learning also
inspires us, as it takes into consideration how
professionals  actually  work.  Schön  has
investigated the professional work practices of
architects, lawyers and medical doctors. He
argues  that  the  most  important  aspect  in
professional competence and action is the ability
to 'reflect-in-action' and 'reflect-on-action'. The
first is essential when handling situations that
are puzzling, troubling and uncertain. Reflection-
in-action means reflecting in the midst of the
action while handling the situation and material
at  hand.  Practitioners  make  on-the-spot
experiments that ‘talk back’ to them, and this in
turn becomes the basis for new on-the-spot
experiments.  Reflection-in-action  is  often
stimulated  by  a  surprise,  meaning  that  the
outcome  of  an  action  (or  part  of  it)  is
unexpected. 'Reflecting-on-action' takes place
after  the  action  is  performed  and  involves

distancing oneself and reflecting on what
happened.

Schön emphasises that professionals’
knowledge is embedded within a shared
community of practice and that we are usually
unable to make it verbally explicit. This is in line
with another important source of inspiration,
namely Lave and Wenger (1991) and their
understanding of learning as a situated activity
taking place within communities of practice.
Atlhough Schön does not describe learning as a
social process, Lave and Wenger have studied
the relationship between people, activities and
situations in several communities of practice.
They argue that learning takes place while
performing concrete activities and that all kinds
of activities can be learning; not only those
explicitly defined as such. Lave and Wenger
have developed a notion of learning that they
call  ‘legitimate  peripheral  participation’.
Legitimate peripheral participation describes
how newcomers take part in concrete activities
with more established practitioners and each of
them has a different view of the actions. Both
Schön and Lave and Wenger stress that
learning  depends  on  context  and  that
professional practitioners are in constant
negotiation with the situation at hand, changing
the course of action as needed.

3. Mobile computers with video

For two and a half years the KLIV research
project has studied how learning at an Intensive
Care Unit can be supported with mobile devices
(Björgvinsson and Hillgren 2002; Brandt et al.
2002). KLIV is the Swedish acronym for
'continuous learning within healthcare'. The
project was carried out with close collaboration
between the Intensive Care Unit at the
University Hospital in Malmö and the Interactive
Institute. The design process was iterative,
interdisciplinary and ‘user-centered’ focusing on
collaborative inquiry and participatory design.
We  were present at the unit during their
everyday work and the staff have participated in
various kinds of workshops both inside and
outside their work environment. We often call
this approach an ‘event-driven design process’
(for a further development of this notion see
Brandt 2001).

The KLIV project found that the Intensive
Care Unit’s daily oral learning was a vast
resource in the development of the staff's
professional competences. This is in line with
Orr’s (1996) observation of the importance of
technicians sharing oral stories to sustain and



develop their community memory. The staff now
augment this oral resource by producing short
videos around patient care and medical devices
with  a  digital  video  camera. Passarge and
Binder (1996), whose study involved spring
machine  setters  in  documenting  their  best
practice on video, have influenced our work.
Their videos were used for learning out in the
workplace among the spring-setting machines.
The  videos  were  viewed  on  a  stationary
computer with a laser disc placed on a mobile
table. In the KLIV-project, the staff themselves
produced  the  videos  and  there  were  no
professional  cameramen  involved.  Another
difference is that the videos are viewed on
handheld computers by scanning barcode cards
placed out in the work environment. This gives
more flexibility and the chance to configure the
learning situation according to different needs.

In the video a colleague shows how the task
is carried out including practical tips gained from
experience. The process of making the videos is
a  collaborative  learning  process  including
several steps. It starts when the films are to be
recorded and the people involved reflect on how
the task is best carried out. The reflection
continues when they and colleagues informally
review the videos. This might result in a new film
being made. Later there is a more formal review
session where staff members with different
responsibilities and backgrounds examine the
content closely. Finally the videos are used and
reflected on during daily work. The reflections
might initiate the production of a new video to
develop their work practice further.

4. Self-produced learning material

This section discusses the production of self-
produced learning material. The example is
taken from early in the design process where the
focus was on investigating how the personnel
from the Intensive Care Unit could produce the
learning videos themselves. The specific case
we discuss below is the production of a video on
how to bladder scan – that is, scanning to see
how much fluid the urine bladder contains. In the
process three videos were made. We would
argue that the physical situation facilitates the
production. More importantly, the construction of
the videos prompts an exchange of views and
negotiation,  which  influences  the  video
recordings. The process of making the videos
gives a voice to various individuals. Each has a
different  perspective  on  the  community  of
practice, which is essential for learning and
developing the practice.

Margareta (a nurse) wanted to experience
the actual filming. She asked Bengt Göran (the
nurse's aide) and Lena (another nurse) to help
explore how to produce the films. They decided
that Bengt Göran should be the patient and
Lena should demonstrate how to carry out
bladder scanning. They recorded the video in a
vacant patient room.

Bengt Göran is lying in a patient bed and
Lena and Margareta stand by the bladder
scanner placed on a mobile table at the foot of
the bed. Margareta holds the video camera in
her hand. She asks Lena:

Margareta: How do you think we should
start?

Lena: I thought by starting it [the bladder
scanner] up so you can see where it all
starts.

Margareta: Yes, that is what you are
going to show, yes.

Lena: Should I do that in connection with
the whole thing?

Margareta: Yes, you can just start…

Bengt Göran (interrupts): We first do a
sequence  where  you  prepare  the
equipment, then …

Margareta (interrupts): Yes, precisely.
Yes. And when you feel that it’s time I
can stop [filming], you know.

Lena: I don’t know what the buttons are
called, but I know where to push.

Margareta: Yes, but then I will film that,
you understand.

Lena: Shall I do that first?

Margareta: Yes, let me see… [looks at
the camera to find the record button].

Margareta, Lena and Bengt Göran discuss
how they should go about filming: whether to
film in one continuous sequence or several
short sequences. Confronted with the concrete
situation of bladder scanning, the situation at
hand speaks back to them and they discuss
how they should give form to the film session
and the bladder-scanning video itself.

Faced with the task of showing how to scan
Lena reflects on the fact that she does not know
the names of the buttons but she knows which



buttons to press and why. Margareta thinks this
is fine and that naming is unimportant in this
case. It seems that Lena’s knowledge of
scanning relies on having the equipment in front
of her. Our point is that the physical
environment, and especially the bladder scanner
in   this case, are used, as suggested by Papert
(1980) as 'things-to-think with'. This implies that
knowledge cannot be separated from the
context or the medium that makes the
expression possible, and that objects expand
our minds and bodies.

Figure 1: Margareta, Lena and Bengt Göran produce
a video about bladder scanning. While filming,
Margareta edits the film on location in the
camera.

They produce the video by filming it in three
short sequences retaking the first sequence
once. Directly after the filming they watch the
video in the camera, and reflect on the filming
and the content. Margareta states that Lena did
well but that she spoke softly. Lena agrees.
They also agree that the video shows that it is
not always easy get a good picture of the
bladder. After the video is finished they continue
discussing it.

Margareta: One thing you did not say is,
well, how you actually operate it.

Lena: We have that picture in there, I had
to leave it behind but a new PM has just
been written for it. [A PM is a written
description of how a specific task is
carried out.]

For one minute Lena tells the others what the
PM contains. She goes into detail about how
many millilitres are standard and what to do if
the scanning differs from that. In the end Lena
says:

Lena: But usually, after narcoses, it can
be up to 600ml as far as I have
understood from the new PM.

Margareta: Mmm, I was thinking even
about this one [lifting the probe] – when
one has to use the setting ‘man’ when
women have been operated upon.

Lena: Okay, that’s what you mean.

Margareta: Hysterectomy, yes.

Lena: Yes, yes.

A few minutes later:

Lena: Then some can have air in their
bladder also from the examination, as I
understand.

While making the video, Lena and Margareta
‘dive into’ the situation, and become one with it.
Ackerman (1994) has argued that moments of
separation from the situation are also important
in relation to learning. After the recording they
need to ‘step back’ or distance themselves to
impose momentary order on the situation. They
reflect on how the recording session went and
on the content of the video. This is in line with
Schön's notion of reflection-on-action.

In  the  example  Lena  misunderstands
Margareta and explains the new scanning
procedures, thinking that this is what Margareta
misses from the video account. What Margareta
really misses, however, is how hysterectomies
are scanned. Discussing unusual cases Lena
explains that she has heard that scanning can
be tricky after certain examinations since the
bladder can contain a residue of air. Their
dialogue shows that they have different
experiences of scanning and therefore a
different knowledge of what it means to bladder
scan. Schön (1987) explains that practitioners
construct artefacts as a way to discuss with
themselves how to proceed with the problem
they  are facing. In such an instance the artefact
talks back to the practitioner and is actively part
of the practitioner’s inquiry. An artefact,
according to Schön, is not necessarily physical:
it  can, for example, be a physician’s diagnosis,
a discussion or more generally the way a
practitioner frames a problem. In making the
video Margareta and Lena have, in Schön´s
terms, framed or imposed a momentary order
on what it can mean to show how to bladder
scan. When viewing the video, the artefact
being constructed informs their ideas of what
the video should contain and what is missing



from the account. Ackerman, in line with Schön,
makes the point that we construct, or in her
terms, build forms of, or understanding of, a
situation. We do this to share our understanding
of the situation and to negotiate its meaning
(Ackerman 1994).

The same week an informal review of the
video was held with other people from the staff.
It became apparent that the video needed to
depict better how the scanner probe is handled.
There was too much focus on what went on in
the bladder scanner display. The video also
lacked information on how to set up the scanner
for  children  or  for  patients  who  had  had
hysterectomies.

The following week a new bladder scanner
film was produced. As we wanted more people
to gain experience with the film process a new
temporary film group was formed. Peter was the
cameraman, Göran the person to be filmed, and
Bengt Göran again acted as patient. All of them
are nurse’s aides. We, the researchers, acted as
the intermediaries, explaining what had been
said at the informal reviewing session. Bengt
Göran confirms that it is difficult to handle the
probe. When they hear that they need to include
information on the scanning of hysterectomies
and children they start asking each other if
anyone knows how to do that. Suddenly it
becomes evident that all of them are unsure
about what to do. Britt, a nurse’s aide, passes by
and joins the discussion. She offers to go and
find out what the procedures are. In the mean
time they record a new video focusing on how to
use the probe. While reviewing the resulting
video Britt returns and explains that women who
have undergone a hysterectomy, and children
under the age of 12 of either sex, are scanned
as men.

Figure 2: Based on the comments from reviewing the
first bladder-scanning video Peter, Göran and Bengt
Göran produce a new film focusing more on how the
probe is handled.

The new version of the video was shown at
an informal review. The video was considered
to be good, but the reviewers wanted added to
the video information on how to discover and
handle sources of error. For example, patients
who have undergone laparoscopic surgery can
be full of gas; other patients have fluid in the
abdomen. Two weeks later Göran and Peter
appended  the  bladder  scanner  film  with
information on how unusual scanning cases are
handled. Two months later the videos are
formally  reviewed  by  the  people  who  are
responsible for the quality within various areas
at the unit. The last videos were judged to be
very good and accepted for use.

Tracing the path of producing the learning
material reveals that multiple voices within the
intensive care community of practice shaped
the  videos.  Each  person  contributed  their
knowledge and experience, which at times
resulted in negotiations about the content and
structure of the films. It became evident when
knowledge was lacking, and which issues had
to  be  investigated.  Learning  happens  by
discovery, while using the video medium to give
form to their ideas of how to carry out the task,
were which then discussed, argued for and
justified. Learning happens on various levels.
On one level it gives them a chance to discover
and reflect on their work practice and, with this,
how  to  make  descriptions  that  can  be
understood by their colleagues. On another
level, it gives insight into different experiences
and how these can be given a form that helps
develop the knowledge that exists at the unit.
Making the videos was, therefore, both a
dialogue with the physical situation of scanning,
and a social peer-to-peer dialogue between
colleagues.

The production and final acceptance of the
bladder scanner video ran into several months.
This was because more than one film had to be
made and we were exploring what kind of video
production process was needed. There are
examples of much shorter processes. Still,
common to all of them is that they are iterative
processes involving several staff members.

The  advantage  of  producing  their  own
learning material is that the content reflects
experiences of working at the unit: for example
what to be observant about and what can be
difficult. The production process being carried
out in-house allows the video to be formed and
transformed reflecting the experience of the
staff and therefore what knowledge is needed in
their communities of practice. Many of the staff



have also reported that it is important for them to
know the people in the videos, as it gives them
confidence in the way things are carried out in
their work environment.

5. Using mobile video

Viewing video on handheld computers makes
it possible to configure where and when the
learning is to take place. The following is an
example where it is important to view a video
close to the medical equipment that is to be
assembled. It also illustrates that the staff,
working together when using the video, draw on
each other’s experiences and complement the
video. In the example below Ulrika, a newly
employed  physiotherapist,  is  involved  in  a
training sessions where she and Jenny, the
senior physiotherapist, attach a Fisher & Paykel
(a humidifier apparatus) to a ventilator.

Figure 3 a,b: As part of a training session Jenny
(senior) and Ulrika (newcomer) watch a video on
how  to mount a Fisher & Paykel to a ventilator. They
have brought part of the equipment (the valve) into
the room with the stationary computer to be able to
compare the valve with the video.

Jenny has been away from work for two years
and is therefore a bit uncertain about the

procedure. They know that their colleague,
Anna, who knows the equipment well, has
made a video about it. The video is accessible
both via a handheld computer and a stationary
computer but the latter is not located in the
medical equipment room. At the time both
Jenny and Ulrika were unfamiliar with the
handheld computers, having missed the
introduction at the unit. Therefore they decided
to  watch the video on the stationary computer.
Afterwards they go to the equipment room and
begin assembling the Fisher & Paykel. Having a
problem mounting the expiration valve, they
decided to bring the valve with them to the
stationary computer so that they can easily
compare it with the video.

They watch their colleague in the video
pointing at two small holes on the expiration
valve. Holding the valve close to the screen
they alternate between looking at the video and
examining the physical valve. In the video Anna
emphasises that one should avoid letting the
holes come close to each other because then
the air will leak out. In the video Anna says: ‘I’m
putting in the expiration valve so that you can
hear a click’. At the same time you see her
performing the action and hear the click in the
video.

Jenny: Now we know how we will mount it,
like this.

Simultaneously Jenny shows how, by moving
the valve in a similar way to the video.

Ulrika: Yes.

Ulrika points at the flow sensor in the video and
asks:

Ulrika: Then you don’t need to take that part
away or?

Jenny: Yes I think you do, I’m not sure but I
think I have seen people doing that.

They return to the room where the ventilator
is and mount the expiration valve. They
proceed with mounting the Fisher & Paykel by
examining the equipment to figure out which
parts  fit together. After some time they get
stuck.

Ulrika: Where did I put the short one Jenny?

Jenny: The short one you put on … well yes,
we should have a look on the handheld
computer now.



One of the researchers gives them a short
introduction to the handheld computer. Even
though they already have managed to mount the
expiration valve they decide to see this part of
the video to doublecheck if it was correctly done.

Watching the sequence Jenny says:

Jenny: There you can see that she [Anna in
the video] doesn’t have the flow sensor there
[mounted at the expiration valve].

A little later Ulrika points at the video and says:

Ulrika: She [Anna] already has that one in
place [meaning that the flow sensor is
mounted to the ventilator].

Jenny: Hmm, yes probably she has, but I
can’t see it.

A little later Jenny says: Yes she puts it in
place in the little rubber … shall I move on?

Figure 4 a, b: The small mobile computer with the
learning video were found more handy than the
stationary computer.

Their reason for doublechecking was that
their  main  concern  when  mounting  the

equipment  was  how  the  expiration  valve
connects to the flow sensor and the ventilator.
They want to be sure that they have done this
right. In the video Anna moves the flow sensor
to the left on the ventilator after she mounts the
expiration valve. By watching the video and
discussing it with each other they realise that
the flow sensor is not connected to the valve
before connecting the valve to the ventilator.
Ulrika sees on the video that the sensor is
mounted to the ventilator before the expiration
valve. First Jenny cannot see that, but she soon
realises that this is the case when watching
Anna  move  the  sensor  to  the  left.  When
handling the situation Jenny and Ulrika reflect-
in-action while having a continuous dialogue
with each other, the video and the equipment.
The situation is made up of their activity, the
different kinds of equipment, their colleague on
the video and their previous experience of and
intentions  with  the  activity.  An  important
concern in the project was whether the use of
learning videos would prevent the staff from
reflecting on their practice as they would just
follow and trust an experienced colleague on
the video. The example illustrates that the video
augments interpretation, reflection and learning.

Jenny holds the handheld computer and they
go on watching the video and mounting the
equipment.

Jenny: And then it is the apparatus filter.

Anna in the video: And this filter you may
need to change two times a day.

Jenny: There is quite a lot of condensation
in the tubes. Sometimes you may open up
and empty the tubes if you’re allowed to
interrupt the respirator circle.

From her experience Jenny adds information
that is not in the video but which she thinks is
important  for  Ulrika.  For  some  of  the
procedures, the videos only explain how they
should be performed and not why. Unnecessary
reasons for things that are familiar to most staff
can be excluded since the videos are produced
by people in the context where they are to be
used. However, it is a tricky balance where no
common rules can be applied. Still, when the
videos are used, as in the example, colleagues
help each other by adding knowledge.

The learning situations with Jenny and Ulrika
resemble legitimate peripheral participation,
where  the  ‘newcomer’,  although  on  the
periphery, is actively taking part in the concrete
activity. Looking back on the situation, Jenny



said that it was obvious to her that she was
learning from Ulrika as well as the other way
around.

6. Conclusions

The  KLIV  project  has  shown  that  self-
produced learning materials in the form of short
videos augment peer-to-peer learning. It was
found that the use of video was excellent as a
common  reference  point  for  learning.  The
collaborative production and use of the video
films has made the work practice visible for
more  colleagues  and  this  gives  them
opportunities to reflect on, learn from, and
develop  their  work  practice.  The  highly
collaborative making of the videos helps to make
the content particularly relevant.

It is essential that the videos are contextual;
meaning that the staff produce the videos in
their own work environment and they are later
used in the same environment. The spatial work
environment facilitates the production and use of
the videos. Most importantly, what makes the
videos relevant seems to be the shared social
and culture community of practice. Viewing
colleagues on film gave confidence about how
‘things  are  to  be  solved  here’  and
simultaneously the opportunity to reflect on the
work practice and discuss it with colleagues.

Furthermore, it was found that learning takes
place throughout the whole process of making,
reviewing and using the video. Watching the
videos on small mobile computers provides the
possibility of configuring the learning situation
independent of a specific place. This was highly
valued by the staff. Using cards with barcodes
gives easy access to a specific video, which was
also appreciated.

Abstract

This paper introduces an adaptive learning
environment for use on a desktop PC and a
handheld computer. At the end of the desktop
PC tutorial session, revision material tailored to
the needs of the individual and appropriate for
viewing  on  a  handheld  computer  is
recommended  for  synchronisation  to  the
handheld device. Thus the student has access
to  additional  individualised  mobile  revision
material for use at times and locations where it
would not normally be possible or convenient for
them  to  study,  but  where  they  might
nevertheless welcome this opportunity.

1. Introduction

Adaptive learning environments provide the
opportunity  for  computer-based  educational
interactions to be tailored to the specific needs
of the individual student, by taking into account
their existing knowledge and misconceptions (ie
‘incorrect facts’ or ‘incorrect concepts’ believed
by  the  student),  as  revealed  during  the
interaction. Because of the advantages of such
individualised approaches to computer-based
learning,  adaptive  tutoring  systems  are
becoming more common in the desktop PC and
web-based context. However, despite the recent
interest in possibilities for learning with handheld
computers, little attention has been directed at
the potential for individualised mobile learning.

The Adaptive Geometry Game (Ketamo
2002) offers one example, where a child’s
accuracy and speed of response to polygon
recognition questions is modelled so that the
system may adapt questions as appropriate for
the child's skill level. This is a simple adaptive
system where children are shown a target
polygon and required to identify which of the
additional polygons (which may be rotated) are
identical to the target shape. Depending on the
time taken to answer and the number of errors
in the responses, the system will apply one of
the following conditions: remain at the current
level of difficulty; offer an easier task; or offer a
more difficult task.

A  second  individualised  approach  is
suggested  by  Malliou et  al.  (2002),  who
propose  creating  courses  by  combining
modules into a personalised virtual document
according to a user profile. Their system will be
able to recognise where students lack skills,
and then proactively recommend appropriate
content to the learner.

Approaches such as the above could be
extended  to  allow  more  complex  learner
modelling  to  include  representations  of
misconceptions, as is common in desktop PC
intelligent learning environments, in situations
where  individualised  interactions  based  on
(correct and incorrect) learner beliefs could be a
useful way to support learning in a mobile
context.

In cases where a mobile educational
environment is not designed for use in a
specific context only (for example inside a
museum where the interaction is related to the
particular exhibits available or on field trips
where the interaction relates to specific features
of the trip), a learning environment could



usefully span both the desktop PC and the
handheld computer. Indeed, uniting the desktop
and handheld computer has been suggested for
synchronous and asynchronous collaborative
learning  (Farooq et al. 2002), to allow, for
example, students in the field to communicate
with peers in the classroom. In one-to-one
adaptive learning environments, combining the
use of desktop PCs and handheld computers
provides the benefit of adaptive tutoring on the
desktop computer when the learner is in a
location where a standard PC or laptop is
available, but also allows the interaction to
continue, albeit with some restrictions dictated
by the limitations of the handheld device, when
such facilities are not present. Although the
Adaptive Geometry Game described above has
versions for the laptop and handheld computer,
interactions on each device are separate, that is
a learner will use either a laptop or a handheld
computer. An example of a fully combined
desktop PC/mobile environment is C-POLMILE
(Bull and McEvoy 2003), where an individualised
tutoring session for C programming can take
place on either the desktop PC or handheld
computer, as is most convenient for the learner
at the time. Apart from some presentation issues
due to the size of the screen, interactions on the
two devices in C-POLMILE are identical. The
results of a session can be synchronised to the
other device for seamless continuation of the
interaction.

Another approach to joint desktop PC/mobile
learning  environments  is  to  offer  different
interactions on the different devices, each
interaction option being suitable for the particular
device,  combining  to  form  the  complete
computer-based educational interaction. This
assumes that the learner will have frequent
access to a standard PC or laptop, but is also a
regular user of a handheld computer.

This paper introduces the MoreMaths (mobile
revision for maths) environment, implemented in
Java  and  designed  to  support  a  university
mathematics  course.  The  main  tutoring
interaction takes place on a desktop PC, where
the learner can review and practise material
taught in lectures (or catch up if they missed
lectures), and receive individualised feedback on
their responses, much as in other adaptive
environments. The advantage of MoreMaths
over other intelligent learning environments,
however, is that after the desktop PC-based
interaction, students may take away tailored
revision material on their handheld computer for
later consultation at their convenience. This
revision content is generated for the individual
according to their specific learning needs as
revealed during their interaction with the desktop
PC  component  of  the  environment.  It  is

constructed from a library of short excerpts of
static content, composed and presented via text
templates.

2. Learner modelling

As stated above, there are two components
to MoreMaths. The main interactive session
takes place on a standard PC, where the
learner can view tutorial materials and answer
multiple choice and text entry questions to
practise and test their understanding of lecture
content (Figure 1). A model of the student’s
knowledge and misconceptions is automatically
built, depending on their answers to these
questions. This learner model is used in part in
the conventional manner, as information to
allow system adaptation to the needs of the
individual. For example, if the student responds
correctly to questions in MoreMaths, they are
offered the option to increase the difficulty level
of content and questions presented; whereas if
some of their responses are incorrect, they are
offered the possibility to decrease the current
difficulty level. If the student’s answers reveal a
likely misconception at any level, subsequent
learning content addresses this misconception
as appropriate for their skill level.

Figure 1. The desktop PC tutoring system

In addition to the above, the learner model is
used at the end of the session to suggest
suitable revision material that the student can
synchronise  to  their  handheld  computer:
material that is tailored to their specific current
learning requirements. This enables the student
to continue learning away from the PC, at times
and locations where individualised interactions
would not normally be possible, but where the
student  might  nevertheless  welcome  the
opportunity for further study. Roy et al. (2002)
also argue for mobile learning materials based



on student responses to questions. In addition to
dividing the interaction between the desktop PC
and handheld computer to make the most of the
potential offered by each device, our system
extends this notion by offering tailored revision
materials according to a student’s learner model,
the materials aimed not only at helping the
learner understand areas of difficulty, but also
explicitly addressing their misconceptions.

In addition to revision materials, the learner
model can also be synchronised for viewing.
This is because as well as enabling tailored
interactions, an open learner model (ie one that
is inspectable by the student) can also be a
useful learning resource as it can help the
learner to assess their knowledge and promote
reflection on their learning (Bull and Nghiem
2002; Mitrovic and Martin 2002).

3. Mobile revision material

The attributes included in the learner model
and revision material are based on a study
exploring the contents students would find
helpful in an educational system with a mobile
open learner model (Bull 2003), namely:

•a statement of known topics

•a statement of problematic topics

•a statement of likely reasons for
difficulties (eg misconceptions)

•a comparison of student beliefs and
correct concepts

•a statement of revision requirements

•appropriate revision material.

In the synchronised material the student may
see a statistical overview of their responses to
'end of topic' questions in the form of a graph
illustrating their performance (Figure 2), a
slightly more detailed textual equivalent (Figure
3), and the learner model: specific textual
descriptions of topics known, problematic areas,
and explanations of likely misconceptions
(Figure 4).

Showing the learner model to the learner as
part of the material created for synchronisation
to the handheld computer is designed to help
the  student  better  understand  where  their
difficulties lie, what their specific problems are,
plan their learning and reflect on the learning
process, as their beliefs (knowledge, difficulties
and misconceptions) are made explicit.

Additional revision material is tailored to the
individual according to the contents of their
learner model. If a student appears to be having
only  minor  difficulties,  the  mobile  revision
material for that area is quite brief, mainly having
the  function  of  reminding  the  learner  of

information. This is illustrated in Figure 5 with
the example of introductory material on adding
fractions, where the learner is reminded of the
steps  involved.  However,  more  detail  is
provided if the learner model contents indicate
more serious problems or misconceptions. This
can be seen in Figure 6, where explanations
are also given.

Where possible, descriptions in the revision
material refer to concepts already known, to
support explanations of difficult areas. In the
example in Figure 5, the learner already knows
the  terms  numerator  and  denominator,
therefore  these  can  be  used  without
explanation. In more advanced materials, more
complex known concepts can be used to help
explain advanced content. Misconceptions may
also be dealt with openly in the learner model
as illustrated in Figure 4, where the learner
believes  that  to  add  two  fractions,  the
numerators  and  denominators  are  added
together.

not available. It is intended as a supplement to
the  PC-based  interaction,  to  extend
individualised learning opportunities to other
contexts.

When a student returns to the desktop
computer having reviewed the mobile material,
they are given a brief test on the revision
content to update their learner model to ensure
that the new interaction will be adapted
appropriately for their current understanding. At
the   end of this new interaction, further
individualised mobile materials are created for
synchronisation, as is appropriate for the
student's  new knowledge state.

4. Initial pen and paper evaluation

Following the study described earlier, to
determine the attributes students might find
useful  in  a  mobile  open  learner  model,  a
second pen and paper study was undertaken
after  the  MoreMaths  system  had  been
implemented based on these findings. There
are  many  studies  on  the  effectiveness  of
desktop  computer-based  adaptive  learning
environments. The aim of this study, therefore,
was to evaluate the potential utility of tailored
mobile revision material, such as presented in
MoreMaths, created according to the results of
the desktop PC interaction, and to identify any
aspects of the environment that might require
further consideration before a more detailed
evaluation is undertaken of the MoreMaths
system in use. This initial evaluation consisted
simply of obtaining student reactions to screen
shots, but was nevertheless useful because of
the unusual combination of the desktop and
handheld  computer  interaction:  it  was  not
obvious whether students would welcome this
type of learning support, or if they did, what
form this should take. The intermediate study
sought  to  determine  whether  the  current
implementation is suitable for a full evaluation
across several weeks, where actual and natural
use can be observed.

Apart from the likely utility of the different
components of the mobile materials, a major
general question for investigation was whether
students believed there to be a role for static
content  on  the  handheld  computer,  since
reading on the small screen forces different
reading strategies to those generally used
(Waycott 2002). Would students be prepared to
adapt?

4.1. Subjects

The  subjects  of  the  study  were  nine
volunteers taking an MSc in human-centred



systems at the University of Birmingham. All
subjects had been loaned a Compaq iPAQ
Pocket PC for the duration of their course. The
study  took  place  seven  months  after  the
students had received their iPAQs.

These students had previously taken part in a
logbook study of their general iPAQ use (Bull
2003), and additional questionnaire studies on
their use of specific applications on their iPAQs
(Sharples et al. 2003). All subjects therefore had
a  good  awareness  of  their  general  usage
patterns and were in a position to judge whether
they would be likely to consider using a system
such as MoreMaths as part of their routine.

All subjects had also completed an MSc
module  and  associated  assignments  in
educational  technology,  which  included
components  on  mobile  learning,  adaptive
learning  environments  and  evaluation  of
educational  applications.  Subjects  were
therefore well able to appreciate the aims of
MoreMaths and the questionnaire study from the
information provided.

4.2. Materials and method

A questionnaire with short descriptions and
screen shots of the various components of the
desktop PC and mobile MoreMaths environment
was sent by email to the 17 MSc students who
had been loaned iPAQs. The earlier studies

4.3. Results

Table 1 and Figure 7 show the results for
students' beliefs about the likely utility of the
various components of the mobile part of
MoreMaths, in table and graphical format.

The results were generally positive. The
likely  most  useful  component  of  mobile
MoreMaths  is  the  individualised  revision
material, with eight users expecting this to be
useful (2) or very useful (6), and one unsure.

The possibility to access the learner model
data was also felt to be potentially useful by
most users, with six subjects selecting useful

(3) or very useful (3), one unsure and two
believing that viewing the learner model would
probably not be useful.

Seven subjects also felt that the graphical
statistical overview of their performance would
be useful (2) or very useful (5), with two being
unsure.

The textual statistical overview was the least
popular, though nevertheless potentially useful
to just over half of respondents. Five subjects
expected the textual overview of performance
to be useful, three were unsure and one felt that
it probably would not be useful.

Table 1. Expected utility of mobile MoreMaths
components (textual)


mentioned above had been compulsory for
those borrowing iPAQs. The present study was
optional. Students had not been expecting the
questionnaire:  nine  of  the  seventeen
questionnaires were returned – a 53% return
rate.

The  questions  required  answers  on  the
following  scale:  very  useful/useful/possibly
useful/probably  not  useful/not  useful.  These
questions  related  to  the  various  mobile
components of MoreMaths. As not all students
would need information, practice and revision
material in mathematics, they were asked to
consider their responses with reference to the
possibility of similar materials relating to their
own courses.

It is, of course, not possible to determine the
likely utility or uptake of software based only on
viewing screen shots, but this initial evaluation
does provide an indicator of whether students
would welcome the approach as presented, and
whether they feel that there is an obvious need
to  improve  or  change  any  aspects  of  the
environment to better suit their requirements

are no obvious patterns to students' beliefs
about the likely utility of systems such as
MoreMaths. The strongest tendency was for
some students to prefer a graphical over a
textual statistical overview of their performance,
or vice versa, with a greater number of students
preferring the graphical option. Nevertheless,
some students expected that both would be
useful. There were no other general tendencies.
However, it is interesting to observe that S5 and
S8 gave identical responses (uncertain about
the graphical overview but in favour of the other
components), and S4, S6 and S7 gave similar,


Nearly all subjects felt that some of the
mobile MoreMaths components would be useful,
but were also unsure about other components,
or felt that they would probably not be useful.
Only  S9  had  a  positive  response  for  all
components.

Some individuals expected to find either the
graphical or the textual performance overview
helpful. This situation was apparent with two
subjects (S5, S8) who preferred the textual
alternative, and were unsure about the graphical
version; and four subjects (S3, S4, S6, S7) who
preferred  the  graphical,  but  had  lower
expectations of the textual description. The
remaining three subjects (S1, S2, S9) thought
that both approaches would be useful.

It is harder to look for patterns between
preference for viewing the learner model or
revision materials, since eight of the nine
subjects felt that individualised revision content
would be helpful. The one student who was
unsure thought that the learner model would
probably not be useful (S2). However, the
reverse was not true: S3 who was unsure about
the learner model, and S1 who thought that it
would probably not be useful, were both very
confident about the likely utility of the revision
materials.

There was no clear split between subjects
who would prefer only one of performance
overview (in textual and/or graphical form) or
additional individualised descriptions (learner
model and/or revision material). The only
example was S2, who would use both forms of
overview, but was less interested in the more
detailed individualised explanations.

There were few patterns to responses. Only
S5 and S8 had identical responses – unsure
about the graphical overview, but positive about
everything else. S4, S6 and S7 had generally
quite similar expectations, being unsure about
the  textual  overview,  but  positive  about
everything else.

though not identical responses (uncertain about
the textual overview, but positive about
everything else). Nonetheless, this does not
suggest anything other than the fact that the
subjects believed MoreMaths could be useful in
general, but they would probably prefer the
overview statistics in one format over the other.

Overall the textual overview was the least
popular component of mobile MoreMaths. This
may be because the graphical overview is
easier to interpret quickly. However, additional
detail in the textual version includes information
about which questions were answered correctly
and which incorrectly, that is not available in the
graphical overview. Nevertheless, students may
have preferred to be informed what the correct
answers were (in cases of incorrect responses),
rather  than  just  an  indication  of  the
incorrectness  of  their  answer  (this  was
indicated by one student who provided extra
information on the questionnaire). However,
since the aim of the open learner model and
revision material is to help students overcome
problems and misconceptions, at the design
stage it was decided not to provide precise
details about answers in the overview material.
However,  it  appears  worth  investigating
whether this might be done in the main study,
for example, by providing some learners with
the possibility of viewing this information with
such additional detail, while others receive the
current implementation. Differences in how
users  interact  with  the  other  materials
depending on which version of the textual
overview they have available, may then be
observable. For example, will students try to
work out their difficulties by using the correct
answers in the overview, requiring less from the
learner  model  and  individualised  revision
material?  Or  will  the  provision  of  correct
answers distract students, and not adequately
support their needs? For instance, providing the
correct  answer  will  not  necessarily  help  a



learner to understand that they hold a certain
misconception. However, if students use the
learner model and revision content as intended,
and then use the correct answers provided as a
check to their understanding after reattempting
the questions, this could be a powerful learning
support.  This  will  be  a  useful  question  to
investigate in the main study.

The main concern about the textual mobile
materials in general was whether, despite the
fact that they are tailored to the individual's
needs, students would regard the materials in
mobile form as redundant. For example, instead
of reading static information on a small screen,
they may prefer to print it. The individualised
revision materials are usually the longest and
most detailed, therefore these were of particular
concern. In future work we plan to investigate
the  potential  of  interactive  tailored  revision
materials, where this question would be less
applicable. However, even then, some of the
materials might still be most usefully available in
static form. Therefore it was important to find out
whether students would be likely to accept this,
as there would be little point in running a larger
study  of  the  system  in  use  if  the  main
component appeared unwelcome to users. The
results showed, however, that users were keen
to have individualised, static mobile revision
materials. In fact, this was the most popular
component of mobile MoreMaths. This suggests
the hypothesis that users who regularly use
handheld computers will welcome (static) mobile
individualised  revision  materials  for  use  in
conjunction with their courses. This hypothesis
now needs to be tested, to ascertain whether
such materials really are found to be useful in
practice, or whether the small screen does, in
fact,  impose  too  many  restrictions  on  the
learner.

Two-thirds of subjects also thought that the
mobile open learner model would be useful. This
suggests that although it is an unusual method
of feedback for most of the target users, they
would  find  explicit  reference  to  their
misconceptions and identification of areas of
difficulty helpful. Again, this now needs to be
evaluated in practice.

Only S2 had a preference for overview
material over the more detailed open learner
model and revision material. There were no
preferences the other way around. Therefore, it
appears that most learners would appreciate
both kinds of information about their progress
and learning, and there is no indication that
either kind of information should be removed
from the implementation before the main study.

It is, of course, probable that students taking
a degree in human-centred systems who have
taken the optional educational technology

module,  and  who  regularly  use  handheld
computers, are more likely to be open to using
a system such as MoreMaths. However, we do
not claim that the system should be suitable for
all students or for all subject areas: work on
individualised mobile material is worthwhile if
sufficient students find the approach a useful
additional support. From a sample of 9 it is not
possible to make any strong claims, especially
since the study was based on viewing screen
shots rather than actually undertaking a series
of interactions. As stated in Section 4.2, the
usefulness of software cannot be ascertained
simply  by  having  potential  users  look  at
screens. The most that can be determined is
whether users are interested and likely to be
open to trying the approach – essential if they
are  to  go  on  to  use  the  system.  Such
information is a useful intermediate step as it
can highlight potential problems that can be
given  attention  before  the  main  study  is
undertaken. This willingness and interest in
trying the approach has been demonstrated in
the study – the generally positive replies do
indicate that a full study of the system in use is
worthwhile at this stage. It also suggests that
similar approaches might be welcomed by
students.

An obvious disadvantage of MoreMaths and
similar systems is that students need to have a
handheld computer in addition to access to a
desktop PC or laptop, and this is not yet the
case for most university students. Over the
coming years, the Electronic, Electrical and
Computer  Engineering  Department  at  the
University of Birmingham will see an increase in
the number of iPAQs, some of which will be
available for loan to students. It is therefore
expected that full-scale studies of MoreMaths
and associated systems will be possible in the
context of the courses to which they relate.

5. Summary and further work

This paper has presented the MoreMaths
system:  a  combined  desktop  PC/mobile
adaptive learning environment. In-depth maths
tutoring takes place on the desktop PC, where it
is easier to interact with information and obtain
a well-structured overview of each topic, and
practise the target material. Mobile revision
material based on the learner model, created
according to the student's performance in the
desktop PC environment, and the mobile
version of the learner model, are intended as an
additional interaction to the main computer
session.  These  can  be  reviewed  at  a
convenient time and place on a handheld
computer, when a desktop PC is unavailable.



All mobile learning content is tailored to the
specific needs of the individual.

An initial pen and paper evaluation has been
completed,  suggesting  the  potential  of  the
approach. Future work will involve detailed
evaluation of the desktop PC system, the mobile
revision materials, the open learner model, and
the effectiveness of uniting the two components
of the learning environment in a single system.
The potential for interactive mobile revision
materials will also be investigated.

Abstract

Writing basic skills materials for use on a
handheld device is challenging. The m-learning
project is attempting to meet the challenge by
producing a set of innovative games, materials
and  activities  which  will  not  only  motivate
reluctant young learners but also give them an
opportunity to improve their basic maths and
English skills in a way that complements their
disconnected, mobile lifestyles.

Evaluation  is  another  important  area,
especially relating to cognitive, meta-cognitive
and affective changes which may come about in
learners as a result of using their materials and
systems. Various techniques and activities, eg
VXML and SMS, are being used to discover how
the  target  group  approach  and  experience
learning  using  mobile  devices  in  terms  of
developing their skills and motivation for learning
in general.

1. Developing content

The aim of this paper is to discuss the
pedagogical issues affecting the creation of
basic skills materials to be used on an electronic
device and to explore ways in which learning
materials can be tailored to make the most of
the mobile learning opportunity.

There has been considerable research into
the positive benefits of improving basic skills
using a computer: issues such as maintaining
privacy, avoiding stigma, working at your own
pace have been well rehearsed. The challenge
that  the  m-learning  project  sets  itself  is
attempting  to  maintain  these  benefits  while
shrinking  the  materials  themselves  to  fit

comfortably and accessibly in a handheld
device. There are also opportunities for the
technology to affect the pedagogy, particularly
through the use of collaborative activities that
incorporate elements of mobile learning in new
and effective ways.

The project’s aim is to capitalise on the
obvious benefits of using the technology while
developing innovative materials that maintain a
clear perspective on the learning goal. Materials
produced by the m-learning project partners
combine sound basic skills’ pedagogy with
ground-breaking use of new technologies and
devices.

We are currently in phase 2 of the project. In
phase 1 we trialled several different approaches
with a range of learners. Now, with many
lessons learned (and fed into our development)
and remarkable improvements in technology,
we are busy developing a new generation of
materials and templates to help us take these
lessons one step further.

2. Platforms

Mobile  phones  were  selected  as  one
platform as they are the communication tool of
choice for the m-learning project’s target group
of learners (young adults aged 16–24 not in full-
time education or training) and a relatively
inexpensive hardware option.

Personal digital assistants (PDAs) were the
second platform since they provided greater
computing  power  to  support  multimedia
applications in a small device, and it was
anticipated that the technologies of PDAs and
mobile phones would soon converge. Indeed
this is happening during the course of the
project. Specifically we are using the iPAQ, but
most content is being developed to run in a
browser on the iPAQ so that it is platform



independent and thus able to run on any
palmtop and many of the Smartphones.

3. Working with palmtops

designing  content  that  can
either  provide  or  stimulate
learning  requires  ingenuity,
knowledge of the technological
constraints and the ability to
think inside a fairly small box.

As well as devising a series
of themed quizzes that are also
linked to the basic skills
curricula, the m-learning
partners are working on

materials  that  permit
interaction between learners.
It may also be possible to
use mobile technologies to

assess attitude to learning in more innovative
ways, making use of VoiceXML (voice
recognition software) and SMS (text
messaging).

5. Themed learning


Figure 1: IPAQ showing m-learning material

Palmtops have the advantage of a relatively
large screen so that using graphics, animations
and video-clips is feasible. In the first phase of
the project, literacy and numeracy games and
activities were developed to engage learners
with the technology. More complex learning
objects were also created (see Section 5),
including an animated video soap opera which
was devised on the theme of housing, exploring
life skills such as dealing with landlords but also
providing a context for the practice of basic
skills, for example working out area of walls to
calculate amount and cost of paint required to
decorate.

Scaled-down quizzes on sports themes were
devised and proved popular in trials, particularly
a football referee quiz allowing learners to
assess their knowledge with a view to further
training. Palmtops also link the learner with the
internet and therefore with a potentially rich field
of other learning materials. However, they are
expensive: more executive toy than simple,
practical communication device. They do not
feature large in the landscape of a mobile youth
lifestyle.

4. Working with mobile phones

Mobile phones are used by an enormous
number of young people as part of their social
and cultural life. They are relatively cheap and
easy to use. They can be used as a hook to
draw in non-traditional learners, particularly
those in the 16–24 age bracket. However,

How can we make these tiny bits of content
part of a larger whole? In phase one we
developed themes of content (in conjunction
with trial sites and project partners), spanning
all the available technologies. These themes
were:

•an urban soap opera involving two
young characters moving into a new flat.

The characters were introduced using a
Flash movie (iPAQ), and daily updates to
the story were available via the phone
(VoiceXML). Matching learning activities
were delivered as described above via
the iPAQs

•  football refereeing timed to coincide with
the World Cup. Animated quizzes on the

iPAQs were used, as was a daily quiz of
five questions via the phone (VoiceXML).

In the second phase we are extending this to
cover driving, a broader range of sport and
some aspects of

health education,
a s  w e l l  a s
incorporating  a
wider  range  of
technologies.

6.Learners working together

Although the use of a mobile or palmtop
computer might seem, on the surface, to be an
extremely  isolated,  individualistic  activity,
research has shown that young people can
communicate with each other quite successfully
in the process of using the devices. Learning
itself can be enhanced by peer collaboration, as
suggested by theorists such as Vygotsky (1978).
Educational research into situated learning has
also  pointed  out  the  importance  of  giving
learning a context. In the situated learning
approach, knowledge and skills are learned in
the  contexts  that  reflect  how  knowledge  is
obtained and applied in everyday situations
(Lave and Wenger 2001). Situated cognition
theory conceives of learning as a socio-cultural
phenomenon  rather  than  the  action  of  an
individual acquiring general information from a
decontextualised body of knowledge (Kirschner
and Whitson 1997). Thus, materials, especially
games (see the work of Prensky 2001), can be
developed that are usable by groups as well as
by individuals.

Mobile devices are a key feature in many
activities carried out by young people: making
arrangements, passing on information, passing
on gifts in the form of jokes or graphics, sharing
and comparing ring tones, texting each other
using a still developing new language. This
desire  to  work  collaboratively  and  share
information has been built into a group activity
which encourages learners to develop a virtual
map by attaching photos, text and audio clips
they have gathered during a mobile activity
exploring, for example, their geographical area.

7.Technologies

We have also reviewed the technologies for
which we are developing content, and are now
using:

•SMS – text messages

•M M S – multimedia messages,
including camera phones

•Vo i c eX M L – dialogues over the
phone

•J2ME – small games on mobile
phones

•WAP, MiniBrowser – a collection of
technologies  letting  you  browse

websites from small screen devices.

None of these technologies is particularly rich
by  itself,  but  we  suggest  that  combined
appropriately they can provide an engaging and

beneficial  experience  for  even  the  most
resistant learner.

8.Evaluating progress

Being able to evaluate progress made in
learning via a mobile device has its own set of
challenges,  especially  when  the  devices
themselves are used in the evaluation process.
The project has looked at which other aspects
of  the  learning  process  also  need  to  be
evaluated (see below).

•How do mobile devices motivate
learners to progress to other learning

opportunities?

•  Do materials presented on mobile
devices attract a different type of learner,

one who is less likely to go for a more
conventional approach?

•  Is it possible to identify changes in
attitude to learning when mobile devices

are  used,  and  can  the  devices
themselves be used in the evaluation
process?

In phase 1 the user trials were very limited.
They were conducted in four separate centres
and involved the presentation of materials to 34
learners (19 males, 15 females). Limited data
was collected through observation of the
learners using the equipment, short interviews
with the learners and questionnaires that were
completed by the learners and their tutors.
However, this data was purely exploratory, and
used to inform the development of the learning
materials rather than for formal evaluation of
the learners’ experiences and possible
measurement of learning gains. As such, the
findings are not reported further here.

For  phase  2  we  are  trialling  learning
materials with a much larger group of learners,
in a formal manner, which will be fully evaluated
and the results published accordingly. We are
building into the learning materials various tools
and back-end systems to allow us to collect
data on how the learners use these as well as
some  feedback  on  their  experiences.
Associated  with  this,  we  will  also  be
researching different models of learning and the
support  required  by  learners,  including
collaborative learning, individual learning (with
or  without  peer  support),  online  tutoring,
blended learning and stand-alone units of
learning, etc.

Abstract

This  paper  explores  the  concept  of
participatory  design  in  the  development  of
mobile learning environments. The study has
approached the design of these environments
from  a  learner-centred  design  perspective
(LCD), since traditional methods in user-centred
design (UCD) are too limited to support the
development of educational technologies. By
combining  LCD  scenarios  with  learners’
knowledge of the use of personal technologies,
we  propose  a  new  design  perspective  for
learning  environments.  In  our  study  LCD
provided us with a deeper level of contextual
understanding of the students’ interaction in
mobile learning settings.

Keywords:  participatory  design,  personal
technologies,  learner-centred  design,  mobile
learning

1. Introduction

Since the late  1990s, there has  been
increased use of mobile phones among all age
groups (Ling and Vaage 2000). A growing
interest in the use of mobile technology in
education has emerged, and a number of pilot
projects have tried to find out how these
technologies can be integrated into learning
settings  (Chen, Myers and  Yaron2002;

Roschelle and Pea 2002; Lundby 2002). The
increased use of different artefacts in private
and public situations makes it necessary to
broaden the perspective of the use of these

technologies.  The concept of personal
technologies, coined by Sharples (2000), where
mobile technology and other internet

technologies are defined as subsets of
technology used in private and public situations,
provides a promising approach. This concept
helps to illuminate both the structures of

interaction and the relations between
technologies and the situations in which they
are used.

This concept also stresses the importance of
reconsidering the design models for learning
environments. Traditionally, the development of
learning environments is characterised by a
teacher-centred perspective  (Carroll et  al.
2002). The models are designed according to
rules imposed by teacher practice or technical
constraints. This discussion implies a shift to

how we can include a learner-centred
perspective. Such a perspective would focus on
design  of learning environments that support an
understanding of the social context of learning
and capitalise on the use of personal
technologies based on how students interact
and communicate. This paper presents an
example of how to approach the problem so
that user-centred design (UCD) is used to
inform the design and to gain an understanding
of the mechanisms of the students’ learning
context. A model that can be aligned to the
UCD approach is participatory design (PD)
(Carroll et al. 1998). However, both UCD and
PD have had limited impact on the design of
educational technologies. One reason for this is
that learning settings have not yet been able to
develop strategies for technology use and
pedagogical models for such use.

2.Towards learner-centred design

According to PD, users are seen as experts
in a specific context of development and,



therefore, PD involves users and designers
working together during an extended period. The
advantages of PD are that users and designers
may exchange perspectives; learning about
each other’s skills and values, and jointly
identifying appropriating sets of requirements
(Carroll et al. 1998; Ehn 1988; Kensing and
Munk-Madsen 1995; Kyng 1994).

An alternative to UCD is learner-centred
design (LCD). This approach moves beyond
usability issues to the challenge of developing
computer systems that support people in a
learning environment, ie in developing expertise
in work practices that are new and unknown
(Soloway et al. 1996). It was developed as an
alternative to the UCD framework (Norman and
Draper 1986) and addresses some of the
problems not supported by UCD. An LCD
perspective  sees  the  participants  as
heterogenous learners, and not as homogenous
users  within  a  work  context.  The  UCD
perspective addresses the needs of particular
users with expertise in the target work practice,
and the main goal is to develop tools that
support that work practice. Within LCD, the goal
is instead to help learners (novices in a given
work practice) to learn new practices. The
unique characteristics in LCD identified by
Soloway et al. (1996) and further developed by
Quintana et al. (2002) are listed below.

•Growth: The development of expertise must

be the primary goal of educational software.

It supports the learner to ‘learn by doing’
rather than just do tasks, eg be more
efficient (as in UCD).

•Diversity: Learners are heterogeneous in
contrast to users within UCD who can be

seen as homogenous. Users within UCD
share a common work culture but the
learners might not share a common culture
or level of expertise in the work practice.

•Motivation: The learners’ motivation and
engagement cannot be taken for granted

throughout the design process, in contrast to
professionals who, by the nature of their
involvement with their work, have an intrinsic
incentive to contribute.

2.1. The learner: expert or novice?

As computer users in UCD are considered to
have expertise in their work practice and mainly
need  tools  developed  to  support  their
implementation of work, they contribute to the
design  process  with  their  expertise  and
knowledge of work and task performance. The
learners’ knowledge of personal technologies
qualifies  them  as  experts  in  their  use  of
technology but, on the other hand, they are

novices in their work practice and the tools to
be developed are not explicitly to support task
performance. Instead, they need to address the
learners’ lack of experience and support them
while they engage in the new learning practice,
to reduce the risk of a misunderstood or
incorrect work model. According to Soloway
and Pryor (1996) learners can be characterised
as follows:

Learners do not possess a significant amount of
expertise in the work practice. Learners (for example,
the business student or the new consultant) do not
share an understanding of the activities, terminology,
and so forth of the work practice with their
professional counterparts (like financial analyst or the
corporate manager). More specifically, learners have
an incomplete or naïve mental model of the work
they are trying to perform. It may be the case that
learners have an ‘empty’ model of the work practice,
not having any idea about what is involved in the
work. It may also be the case (and more often than
not) that learners have some model of the work
practice, albeit a misunderstood or incorrect work
model. Regardless, Learner-Centred tools need to
take this lack of experience into consideration and
address the corresponding learner needs. This way,
learners can engage in the work to form a more
correct and appropriate model of the work practice
that they are engaging in.

Quintana et al. 2002, page 607

The LCD definition coined by Quintana et al.
(2002)  is  considered  in  three  different
dimensions.  First,  the  identification  of  the
audience  addressed  by  LCD  –  learners;
second, the LCD problem which is described as
the conceptual gap between the learner and
their work; and third, the underlying approach
taken by LCD to address the central design
problem.  Rather  than  addressing  the  gulf
between execution and evaluation (Norman
1989, pp49–52), which is central to traditional
user-centred design, the issue is rather the
conceptual gap between the learner and their
work. The gap can be described as a gulf of
expertise between the learner and the model of
expertise, embodied by an expert in the work
practice (Quintana et al. 2002). This identifies
the distance between the novice, who arrives in
a new community of practice, and the full
participants in that particular practice. To be
able to carry out their daily practice, the learner
needs to develop an appropriate and correct
conceptual model of the work involved.

2.2. Towards a conceptual model – the
use of scenarios

One approach to applying LCD is to use
scenarios to encourage learners’ participation



and to explore and explain their behaviour.
Scenarios  can  be  used  throughout  the
development, as it is an iterative process. The
assumption is that designers will begin at a fairly
coarse-grained level, adding more detail as they
better understand the user’s needs and the
opportunities offered by the system (Kyng 1994;
Winograd 2002). Designers may choose to work
only with scenarios when reasoning about, and
elaborating  on,  a  system’s  functionality.
However, they may also elect to make their
reasoning more explicit by analysing the design
rationale ‘claims’ associated with user scenarios
(Carroll et al. 1994). According to Quintana et al.
(2002), scenarios can help us analyse and
articulate the overall structure and components
of work practice to be mediated to learners. The
use of scenarios can promote an exploration of
future work context and the development of a
conceptual  model  among  learners.  Thus,
learner-centred tools should embody the work
culture  in  a  manner  that  the  learner  can
understand.

Through  observation,  the  designer  can
develop the experience and expertise needed to
shape a work model of the target work practice.
This model needs to be conceptualised in a way
that the learner can understand. By using work
experts (professionals), to create a good work
model,  and  educational  experts  (such  as
teachers  and  educational  researchers)  to
support the communication with the learners and
to guide the learners in their learning process,
the LCD team might promote the shift from
learner to expert (Quintana et al. 2002).

In  our  study,  we  have  adopted  a  LCD
perspective, which involves learner involvement
through  various  techniques  and  workshops,
such  as  interviews  and  development  of
scenarios. Our application of PD strives towards
a  sequential  development  aiming  to  give
designers a structure for handling the complex
interdependency between learning, users and
tools.

3. The object of study and method

The data presented in this paper is generated
from a longitudinal case study. Since 2000 our
work  has  been  directed  towards  the
understanding of mobile technologies and their
use    in the social context of distance learning.
The study can be divided into three stages.

The first phase of the study focused on the
communications patterns among the learners
(Hedestig and Orre 2002).

The second phase of the study focused on
the  learners’  exploration  and  practice  of
personal technologies, such as personal digital

assistants (PDA) and mobile phones. Thus, our
aim  has  been  to  understand  the  existing
communication patterns and use of mobile
artefacts among undergraduate students, and
to use this knowledge to inform the design of
learning  environments  for  distance  and
decentralised education. Our point of departure
has been a bottom-up approach that views
learning from a student’s perspective and so
gets  close  to  how  students  handle  their
everyday life and studies (Hedestig et al. 2002).

The third phase, discussed in this paper,
contains a user-centred approach to the design
of a learning environment, which gives us the
advantages of making a distinction between the
design of new educational technologies and the
design of learning environments. Instead of a
new artefact design, we propose to use existing
artefacts. To accomplish this we have applied
two different design methods, ie PD and LCD.

The  students  in  this  study  have  freely
participated in the project and consist of 24 off-
campus learners in northern Sweden. They
have good or extensive experience of the use
of personal technologies in private and more
public situations. In the preliminary design
process, we took into account the difficulty of
retaining  the  learners’  motivation  and
engagement throughout the design process
(Soloway et al. 1994). Thus, previous meetings
with  the  students  have  illuminated  and
investigated the students’ intrinsic motivation to
participate and contribute. The students stated
that their motivation depended on their present
knowledge  of  technology  and  future  work
practice. Our design team consisted of work
experts (to conceptualise the work model to the
learners), and educational experts (teachers
and educational researchers).

The study applied ethnography as the main
data  collection  method.  We  have  had
continuous meetings with the students and
during the meetings project participants have
taken field notes. The observations have been
complemented with video and audio recordings.
Furthermore, all field notes and recordings have
been  transcribed.  Each  group  has  been
analysed  and  compared,  with  the  aim  of
identifying  key  passages  in  the  empirical
material.

4. Scenarios in practice

This case study was conducted in spring
2003,  with  students  participating  in  a
decentralised educational programme 140km
from  the  campus.  Eight  researchers  and



teachers participated from the Department of
Informatics, together with 24 students studying
informatics. The main activities in the spring
concentrated  on  user  meetings  and  the
construction of scenarios.

4.1 Designing scenarios

PD scenarios can be used to characterise
workflow and breakdowns, and can be used as
conversational  props  in  user–developer
workshops. With scenarios, users do not need to
understand the underlying design model or the
implementation to provide highly specific change
requests.  In the work with scenarios, designers
have the opportunity to articulate and confront
their design suggestions and models with real
users, and so test and evaluate their relevance
for  the  specific  context.  Human–verbal
interactions consist largely of exchanging stories
(Carroll et al. 1998). The use of scenarios can
give opportunities to generate a vocabulary that
includes both a description of current use of
technology in a learning situation, and future use
based on the integration of personal and
educational technologies. The objective in our
study was to accumulate learners’ attitudes to
the learning practice and possible future
settings. The scenarios were characterised as a
catalyst, and generated and developed visions
of how new software could affect their studying
and learning practice.

Our project started with an opening session
that explained the idea of scenarios as a
technique for requirements analysis in system
design. Thereafter we scheduled four user-
meetings with the students, approximately once
each month. In each session, two scenarios
were discussed, with narratives that focused
either on individual use of personal technology
or on collaboration in a student group or class.
Both scenarios highlighted learners’ reflections
about the individual learning setting combined
with their private situation, and coordination,
cooperation and collaboration within the group.

In each session, we divided the class into
small groups of three to six members. In the first
session, the groups were divided into sets of six
students and thereafter we carried out the
meetings  in  smaller  sets  of  three  to  four
members. The size of the groups was designed
to capture the participants' experiences and
reflections both as a member of a larger group
and as a legitimate member of a small group.
The length of the session was approximately
three hours and was conducted in the afternoon,
after the students’ ordinary lecture time. The
students usually discussed each scenario for
one hour. One member from the project team
was present in each group although their role
was  only  to  clarify  if  there  was  a

misunderstanding  connected  with  the
scenarios.  After  the  group  discussion,  a
summary was made with the whole group. This
gave us the opportunity to compare similarities
and  differences  within  the  groups  and  to
incorporate reflections from the complete group.
These discussions also contained an evaluation
of the use of the scenarios.

4.2  User  interaction  and  vision
scenarios

The  four  user  meetings  had  different
perspectives on the learning settings. The first
session  included  scenarios  that  concerned
personal  information  and  communication
technologies (ICT) within a learning context.
Our aim was to capture the learners’ current
communication  behaviour  and  their  use  of
technology, and compare those to a previous
analysis  of  their  communications  patterns.
These scenarios followed the key ideas of
UCD,  namely  the  construction  of  user
interaction  scenarios,  and  a  narrative
description of what people do and experience
as they try to make use of computer systems
and applications. User interaction scenarios can
also be used as a medium for representing,
analysing and planning how a computer system
might affect its users’ activities and experiences
(Carroll 1997).

During the first session, the learners
reflected on present performance in relation to
possible interactions through new technology.
Much of the discussion concentrated on their
recognition of the cases and willingness to
adjust  to the new circumstances presented in
the scenarios. Remarks such as ‘I do not
recognise myself in this scenario’ and ‘Ah that
is   just you [Lars]!’ were common as were
comments such as: ‘This sounds really great, I
would like to do that’ and ‘This is not how we do
things, we might, but then I see problems…’. A
great part of the discussion focused on the
interaction possibilities of the technology, eg
notification, network, size of technology, etc:
‘Here   it would be great to get both sound and
colour notification, sound to hear and colour to
find the change made’ or ‘To be able to check
this on the bus back home, would give [me]
more freedom’. Thus, some learners did not
recognise the potential of the technology to the
same extent as their fellow participants; for
them, the availability of face-to-face meetings
was the ultimate solution. This gave us
indications of their willingness to use new
technology in their present learning setting.
Specific design suggestions were also given,
based on their knowledge of technology.

The  second  session  included v i s i o n
scenarios that focused on the future learning



setting in relation to less specific technologies.
Vision scenarios can be used as a guide for
development with a focus on needs and
opportunities as a means to convey and develop
visions  of how new technology could affect
interaction. Design proposals for the future
system can be discussed and reflected on in an
early stage of collaboration between designers
and users, eg feasibility and effectiveness
issues are discussed (Carroll et al. 2002 ) .
Educational experts and teachers within the
project team developed the scenarios used in
the second session. Our interest in vision
scenarios was based on their impact on the
learners' future learning practice.

later with the technology developed within the
project, an interesting aspect has been to
compare their first impression from the narrative
presentation with their actual, physical use of
the learning system. The second scenario was
a vision scenario developed to capture the
learners’ reflections on their long-term use of
the technology, in a possible future learning
setting. In the third session, participants were
encouraged to use a matrix presenting the
individual in relation to their group, their class
and  their  teacher,  and  the  diversities  of
personal and public information (see Figure 1).

Individual   Group   Class


Here the ability of the learners to combine
previous and present discussions in the scenario
sessions was obvious. The core element in their
discussions was the future learning setting in
relation to the present. The learners reflected on
their present group activities, problems and
opportunities. They made interesting points
about their present learning setting, both as a
group and individuals. ‘We would meet up at
campus, wouldn’t we?’ and ‘I think I would study
at home and then contact you through [some]
technology if I had any questions’ were just two
of many examples. The students also discussed

ways of interacting within study groups and
between learner and teacher. Typical comments
were ‘It’s quite easy to share information by
using e-mail’ and ‘E-mail isn’t useful when you
need to mediate difficult information, like Java
code’.

Even where they were used to employing a
specific support, they were open to something
else: ‘It is always fun to try another learning
practice’. They recognised their learning practice
in the narrative presented in the scenario and
were therefore able to reflect on shortcomings
and visions for their learning. ‘It might happen
that it is more effective learning in a bigger
group’, ‘A great thing would be if communication
could take place in an online forum as we
comment in earlier session’ and ‘A forum would
open up for the possibilities for the teacher to
communicate knowledge to the whole group’.
This illuminates their reflections on present
study techniques, and their willingness to accept
or dismiss the new suggestions presented by
teachers in the scenarios.

The  third  session  included  both  a  user-
interaction scenario and a vision scenario. The
user-interaction  scenario  contained  more
functions  and  communication  possibilities,
integrated in a new, more recently developed
technology. The aim was to capture the learners’
first impression, and their thoughts and possible
experiences, when they were presented with a
new setting. As these learners will be presented

Figure 1: The matrix used in the third session. This

matrix contains example information from one of the
groups.

During the third session students appeared to
make great use of the matrix presented to
them. Discussions happened according to the
categorisations: ‘Should we start by choosing
category? Private–Public, is that one OK?’ Also,
during the third session it was noteworthy that
the students first described all the features in
the first scenario as interesting, and discussed
possible use situations. There was a high level
of acceptance. Later, when they discussed the
second scenario, they hesitated over some of
the features, for example a camera, to use in a
learning setting. They compared some of the
features to games – interesting, but with shifting
use over time. Other features were seen as
beneficial, and compared to those features
already adopted from previous phases of the
project such as the calendar.

Interestingly, during all the sessions remarks
were made about benefits they found which
might not suit them but might help someone
else. ‘I don’t need this, but I think it’s needed for
NN, so why not!’ or ‘This would actually be
advantageous for the teachers as well’ are two
examples.

The  fourth  session  has  not  yet  been
conducted but, according to our plans, we will
present a mock-up prototype based on results
from the previous sessions described above.



5. Discussion

Using  the  scenarios  in  PD  gave  us  the
chance to capture the learners’ thoughts, views,
and behaviours in a mobile learning setting.
Using interviews and scenarios we integrated
their reflections into our conceptual model of
their  present  and  future  learning  setting.
Learners’ participation in the design process
promoted their exploration of their future work
context and the development of a conceptual
model. The sessions gave them the chance to
connect their present learning setting to possible
future  settings.  They  could  reflect  on  their
present performance, benefits and problems
connected  to  their  strategies  to  achieve
knowledge, and they had the opportunity to
shape new ways of performance jointly. Any
changes in the scenarios were based on their
remarks, and supported the development of their
conceptual model of a future learning setting.

An LCD approach guides the learners in
making the shift from learner to expert, eg to
bridge the conceptual gap (gulf of expertise –
learner/model of expertise – expert)). In our
case, did the scenario sessions promote such
bridging  but  also  question  and  shape  our
(expert) conceptual model? The learners, with
their reflection, gave us insights into whether or
not  our  assumptions  were  correct.  The
mediation  of  the  conceptual  model  was  a
bridging from two directions, rather than a one-
way street.

The difficulty of measuring motivation is an
aspect of concern in LCD. As previously stated,
learners’ motivation and engagement cannot be
taken for granted throughout the whole design
process. The incentive to participate in our case
was, according to the learners, their interest,
and knowledge of personal technology. Many of
their  discussions  concerned  the  interaction
possibilities  of  technology,  eg  notification,
network, size of technology, other choices of
resemblance, etc. However, it was not only the
interest  in  technology  that  affected  their
motivation; using scenarios gave them an insight
into their contributions, as the scenarios were
used as an iterative process and so they could
identify all the changes made from their previous
remarks.  Recognising  themselves  in  the
narrative scenarios could also be a motivational
factor, as it implies that they are at the centre of
interest.

The  use  of  the  scenarios  revealed  the
heterogeneous character of the learners, not
only to us as designers, but also to themselves.
This was illuminated by their identification of use
situations and their concretisation of possible
solutions from the scenarios that could benefit
both themselves as individuals and the group as

a whole. The participants acknowledged the
value of the scenarios as the foundation for
discussion and reflection. The iterative process
of the scenarios also gave them the chance to
make  connections  between  different
discussions and include features or situations
excluded in later sessions. Mostly they saw
scenarios  as  a  tool  to  structure  their
discussions so that they did not drift from a
given subject.

The  students’  knowledge  of  personal
technologies  has  had  an  impact  on  the
construction of the scenarios. The knowledge of
their everyday practice of interaction provides
design proposals that would not have been
accomplished  without  their  participation.
Instead of following traditional guidelines while
designing learning environments, we were able
to reconsider the very foundation of using ICT
tools in learning environments.

6. Conclusions

Our study shows a prominent difference
between the traditional UCD approach and
LCD. First, users within UCD are seen as
homogenous, while learners within LCD are
seen   as a heterogeneous group. The learners
might not share a common culture or level of
expertise in the work practice and this diversity
must be taken into account in the development
process. Second, within LCD the goal is to help
learners (novices in a given work practice) learn
new practice. Thus the primary goal when we
develop educational software should be to
support the learning process rather than a
predisposed process to accomplish a specific
task   as articulated by UCD. Third, the LCD
approach emphasises the need to integrate
private use of personal technologies into public
learning settings. Therefore, we extended the
focus on technology use, not only to a formal
domain such as work or learning but also to
informal communication patterns.

Finally, our studies show that the students’
knowledge of personal technologies defines
them  as  expert  users,  and  that  their
participation reveals concealed use of personal
technologies in the learning environment. This
knowledge levels out the relation between
learners and designers, and stresses a deeper
level of user involvement in the design of
mobile learning environments.

Abstract

Face-to-face  learning  scenarios  are
characterised by rich forms of cooperation
including natural speech, gesture and other
visual communication. However, with a growing
number of participants the cooperation needs to
be coordinated and the individual participation in
the cooperation decreases.

Using mobile devices like personal digital
assistants (PDAs), interactivity and cooperation
in such scenarios can be enhanced. But the
design of such a technical system must also
carefully preserve the traditional advantages of
face-to-face scenarios.

In this paper, we present an approach to
integrating  mobile  devices  into  face-to-face
learning  scenarios  which  combines  the
advantages and benefits of both. We describe
ConcertStudeo, a platform that implements our
approach. ConcertStudeo provides tools for
interactions, such as brainstorming, a quiz,
voting and others, by using wirelessly connected
PDAs  in  combination  with  an  electronic
blackboard.   We   sketch   the   current
implementation of ConcertStudeo and report
some experiences with using the system in a
university course.

1  Introduction

The quality of e-learning scenarios varies in
many  ways  including  synchronicity,  local
distribution, group size and efficiency.

In this paper we concentrate on face-to-face
learning scenarios, such as workshops and
classroom sessions, which are still the most
common way of educating people.

Face- to- face  learning  offers  many
advantages and is, in comparison to individual
or distributed learning, accompanied by richer
natural  communication,  including  gestures,
mimicry, body language and so on.

But as the number of participants increases
the efficiency and quality of communication can
get worse. This can lead to fewer contributions
per participant and can lower the learning
results.

The  following  approach,  based  on  the
ConcertStudeo research project carried out at
Fraunhofer IPSI (Darmstadt, Germany), aims to
improve face-to-face learning by supporting and
enhancing interaction and cooperation between
the tutor and the students.

2  Requirements for face-to-face
learning support

As mentioned above, the advantages of
face-to-face learning are the wide range of
possibilities   i t   provides   for   direct
communication. The goals of ConcertStudeo
are to keep as many of the advantages of direct
communication as possible and to provide
additional functionality to enhance interactivity
and cooperation in the classroom (compare to
Roschelle and Pea 2002a, 2002b).

In traditional learning scenarios, for example,
a blackboard or an overhead projector is used
for the presentation of the learning material.

If there are questions or unclear points each
student can immediately ask the teacher and
receive an answer verbally, as a written text or
as a sketch on the board. Vice versa, a teacher
can test knowledge by asking a question, which
has to be answered by one or more students. In
most classroom scenarios each student can
express his or her opinion or contribute an idea
spontaneously, even without being asked a
question.



The front-oriented presentation on the board
provides a common focus and direct awareness
of the current activities.

With a traditional blackboard the presentation
of the learning material can happen on demand
and can be interrupted at any time. Using
blackboards causes almost no noise or other
distraction. It can provide supplementing
information to the students without replacing
existing communication channels like speech or
gestures. Its use is an e n r i c h m e n t in
communication rather than a replacement.

Similar gains should be aimed at with a face-
to-face learning support system. In practical
terms this means a system for supporting face-
to-face learning that is comparable to traditional
scenarios with respect to size, noise, usability
and the potential to integrate personal learning
material.  To  display  a  similar  amount  of
information, an electronic support system should
ideally have a display area the same sort of size
as a traditional blackboard. Furthermore, it
should not cause too much distraction by noise,
and its use should ideally be as intuitive as a
blackboard. It should also allow the integration
and navigation of personal learning material and
support a process to generate or change it
dynamically.

3  Interaction and cooperation
design

A system for face-to-face learning support
should keep the advantages of traditional face-
to-face learning scenarios and provide additional
benefits.  Potential  extra  benefits  include
structuring the learning process, increasing the
participation of the students, evaluating the
students’  interactions,  and  integrating  the
interaction with the learning material.

The learning process can be structured by
assigning roles to individuals and by dividing the
process into a sequence of phases.

Student participation can be increased by
providing anonymity (eg in anonymous voting),
by providing interactive interfaces (eg in a
single-choice quiz the students can select only
one answer), and by involving all students in
parallel, using one device per student.

The system can accelerate the evaluation of
an interaction by automatic aggregation of the
students’  contributions  (eg  a  histogram  for
alternatives, an overlay for sketches, statistical
values for numbers, etc).

Interaction can be initiated by the trainer
spontaneously or, if it is logically bound to a
specific part of the learning material, it can be
predefined  and  anchored  in  the  learning
material. The result of an interaction (eg a
structured collection of ideas as the outcome of

brainstorming) can be linked to the existing
learning material, mirroring the specific learning
process of a given class.

The  design  of  an  interaction  type  and
consequently the design of an interaction tool
involves  tackling  a  range  of  questions
concerning  the  above-mentioned  potential
benefits.  In  the  following  we  will  use
brainstorming as an example for an interaction
in face-to-face learning and show how a system
can improve the brainstorming.

In general, the goal of brainstorming is the
creative generation of ideas. In a learning
context,  brainstorming  is  used  to  collect,
activate and communicate existing knowledge
on a certain subject matter. The brainstorming
method is based on a small set of rules: (1) no
criticism of ideas, (2) free association, no idea
is too silly, (3) all ideas belong to the group as a
whole, (4) building on the ideas of others is
explicitly encouraged, and (5) generate as
many ideas as possible in a short time.

Like  many  other  group  processes
brainstorming  suffers  from  some  problems
including  productivity  loss,  unequal
participation, fear of criticism and non-task-
related activities (Diehl and Stroebe 1987,
1991). An electronic brainstorming system can
address these problems. For example, the
system can allow ideas to be entered in parallel
and all contributions to be treated anonymously
(Valacich et al. 1991).

How  can  the  brainstorming  process  be
structured?  How  can  participation  be
increased? How can the students’ interactions
be evaluated? How can the interaction be
integrated with the learning material?

The brainstorming process can be split into
two  phases:  a  phase  for  generating  and
collecting ideas and a phase for structuring the
collected ideas into clusters. The system can
support different roles and activities in the
brainstorm. A person taking the moderator role
is allowed to delete and structure ideas in the
second phase; a regular participant is allowed
to contribute ideas but not to delete ideas and
so on. Tightly related to the structuring of roles
and activities is the structuring of the display of
information in the brainstorming process. In
general,  information  can  be  displayed  on
individual displays for individual participants or
on a public display for the whole class. To
promote building on the ideas of others, the
public display as the common focus is used for
the display of ideas. The individual displays are
used to input the individual ideas in parallel.

In traditional brainstorming all ideas have to
be noted by a moderator or written cards have
to be attached to a pin board. An electronic
brainstorming can collect and display all ideas



automatically which accelerates the evaluation
and further processing of the collected ideas.

For future use and reference the results of the
brainstorming can be stored as a part of the
learning material.

4  Implementation of ConcertStudeo

The ConcertStudeo platform (Wessner et al.
20 03 ;   ConcertStudeo  2003)  provides
configurable tools for spontaneous and planned
interactions such as brainstorming, a quiz,
voting or ranking.

The  system  hardware  consists  of  an
electronic blackboard, a connected PC or laptop,
and a number of PDAs for the students. Our
current configuration is based on a SMART
Board, a Windows-based laptop and six Pocket
PCs  (Toshiba  e740).  The  ConcertStudeo
software includes the following parts:

•CS Board, the software that runs on the
PC of the electronic blackboard and which

is mainly used by the tutor or trainer

•CS Control, the software that runs on
each of the PDAs used by the students

•CS Server runs on any PC, eg the one
running the CS Board software.

The CS Board software allows the seamless
embedding of arbitrary learning material by
integrating  the  functionality  of  the  Internet
Explorer. This way any kind of web-based
learning material like HTML files or Powerpoint
slides can be integrated and navigated.

Figure 1 Screenshots of ConcertStudeo
learning content

For each type of interaction a button is
located at the bottom of the display of CS Board.
With these buttons the interactions can be
initiated when the tutor navigates to a position in
the learning material, where an interaction is

intended, ie has been prepared by the tutor in
advance (see Figure 1). Alternatively, the tutor
can initiate an interaction at any position in the
learning material. In this case the parameters
for an interaction, for example a question and
answers, are not pre-defined but given by the
tutor  spontaneously.  After  initiating  the
interaction tool, the display area of the CS
Control switches to the appropriate interaction
interface. CS Board displays the collected input
or  answers  of  the  students  and  provides
dynamic interaction.

Figure 2 Screenshots of a ConcertStudeo quiz.

Left: electronic board Right: PDA

An example of the automatic synchro-
nisation and information exchange between the
CS Board and the CS Control software is
presented in Figure 2. The CS Board software
on the left displays a quiz interaction with an
animated question and the results (so far
received)  of  the  students.  As  already
mentioned, CS Board runs on the electronic
blackboard and is mainly controlled by the tutor.
One  of  the  students’  PDAs  with  the
synchronised user interface is displayed on the
right. It shows the selection options and a ‘Send
Answer’ button.

Taking the example we used for discussing
the design for face-to-face learning support, we
also sketch the brainstorming interaction. In
Figure 3, the CS Board software on the right
displays the current collection of ideas. On the
left the interface of one student’s PDA is
presented.

ConcertStudeo is currently implemented as
a client–server architecture: CS Board and CS
Control act as clients exchanging data with the
CS Server. The CS Board communicates with
the CS Server to start an interaction in the class
and to display the interaction’s results.

CS Control communicates with the CS
Server to display the appropriate user interface
according to the current interaction type, and to
submit the user’s input, for example a text string
or (multiple choice) selections.



CS Board and CS Control are part of a
wireless LAN (WLAN).

Figure 3 Screenshots of a ConcertStudeo
brainstorming. Left: PDA Right: electronic
board

The network can be set up as a so-called ad-
hoc network based on the built-in WLAN cards
of the PDAs and the server PC or the clients can
connect to an access point, which connects the
WLAN  with  the  ‘outside  world’.  The
communication itself is encapsulated as HTTP
requests, which allow the server to be located
behind firewalls.

5  Experiences and outlook
ConcertStudeo was tried out internally at
Fraunhofer IPSI and in a university course. The
internal evaluation by six researchers focused
on the technical stability and the usability of the
system.

Figure 4 The use of ConcertStudeo in a
university course

In a course on computer-supported cooperative
work (CSCW), at the Darmstadt University of
Technology, ConcertStudeo was used by eight
students and the lecturer in two sessions (see

Figure 4). The lecturer initiated mainly quizzes
and brainstorming. The quizzes served for
comprehension  tests  and  to  diagnose  the
students’  current  mental  concepts.  Brain-
storming was used to (re-)activate the students’
previous knowledge and to collect ideas for
solving specific exercises. Voting was used
rarely in this case. As no delicate questions
arose, it was used as an alternative to the quiz
tool when the students had to choose between
two  options.  Real  votes,  for  example  on
whether a proposed solution is correct, were
cast by raising hands. An available video tool
was not used because the lecturer did not have
any video to be presented. In general, the
lecturer and the students had very positive
comments  on  the  system;  they  liked  the
additional possibilities to design and perform
the lecture.

All the participants also liked the integration of
the learning material and the interactions, ie
that the original Powerpoint slides could easily
be used with the ConcertStudeo system and
that the interaction results are preserved as part
of the learning material for further use.

Discussions with teachers and trainers from
various  education  and  training  fields
demonstrated their various requirements of the
desired interaction forms. To address this, we
plan to turn the ConcertStudeo system into a
highly configurable system. In such a toolbox,
various interaction types could be selected and
adapted to the needs of a specific learning
context. Another problem for teachers is the
limited budget for PDAs in schools. To minimise
the costs of PDAs, we are working on reducing
the degree of parallelism a bit by sharing PDAs
between multiple users in the classroom.

Abstract

This paper describes a ‘wireless and adaptive
website’ developed for use by information and
communications technology (ICT) students at a
college in the United Kingdom. It was developed
so that students can look at course information
any time and anywhere. The website uses
adaptive navigation support (ANS) techniques
usually  found  within  adaptive  hypermedia
systems (AHS) that personalise the user’s web
experience by highlighting links of interest
through direct guidance, hiding irrelevant links
and sorting links. Through the use of these
techniques, and in particular the use of both
user models and a Markov model, it was found
that the number of steps used and the time it
took users to navigate the site was improved
significantly. It was also discovered that the
users preferred an adaptive system to a non-
adaptive system.

1   Introduction

Navigation on mobile devices is cumbersome
and time-consuming because of their limited
screen size and bandwidth. As a result, it is
suggested that methods are needed to facilitate
navigation, based on user models that enable
users  to gain fast and efficient access to
relevant information.

This  paper  discusses  an  ‘adaptive  site’
developed for a mobile device; it personalises
the web experience and has been tested on
course information for information and

communications technology (ICT) students at
North Tyneside College.

According to a recent survey by the Learning
and Skills Development Agency (LSDA), 85%
of the 16–24 year olds interviewed use the
internet, 54% are in education, but only 4% of
them use the ‘internet’ on their mobile phones
(LSDA 2002). We aim to bring these three
areas together and produce a personalised,
adaptive website containing course information
that can be accessed efficiently anywhere and
at any time using a wireless device, such as a
mobile phone.

2   Web personalisation

To  improve  the  web  experience  the
prospective  users’  motivation  needs  to  be
established  and  their  interests  and  goals
determined. For example, when a student is
looking  for  the  information  about  their
assignment, this is referred to as ‘goal-directed
browsing’. The student’s behaviour is directed
towards  a  given  objective;  they  are  not
interested in diversions but only in finding their
goal and therefore, personalisation would be
used to link directly to the information sought by
predicting   the   user' s   current   goal.
Personalisation  can  potentially  be  used  to
overcome problems such as disorientation and
information  overload  by  providing  relevant
content and navigation through application of
navigational and presentational techniques. The
user’s  experience  can  be  personalised  in
respect of their knowledge, background and
goals, by using adaptive techniques usually
found  within  adaptive  hypermedia  systems
(AHS).



3   Adaptive hypermedia systems

A number of pioneer adaptive hypermedia
systems were developed between 1990 and
1996 (Brusilovsky 2003) to overcome problems
with  standard  hypertext  systems,  which
motivated the evolution of adaptive hypermedia
systems and hypermedia research (Brusilovsky
1996). This area of research has grown further
in the last seven years because of the growth of
internet and www-based adaptive systems.

AHS bring together ideas from hypermedia,
hypertext and intelligent tutoring systems, to
enable personalised access to information.

The goal of this research is to improve the
usability of hypermedia resources in the area of
mobile devices.

The aims of AHS are ‘to build a model of the
goals, preferences, and knowledge of each user,
and use this model throughout the interaction
with the user, in order to adapt to the needs of
that  user’  (Brusilovsky  2001).  A  ‘classic’
hypermedia application serves the same pages
and the same set of links to all users. This is
true even for most applications that are built on
top of systems that are capable of presenting
different views to different users (De Bra et al.
1999).

AHS  make  it  possible  to  deliver
‘personalised’ views or versions of a hypermedia
document (or hyperdocument for short) without
requiring any kind of programming by the
author(s) as the AHS do all the adaptation
automatically, simply by observing the browsing
behaviour of the user.

There are many adaptive systems that allow
‘personalised’ views based on user-selected
stereotypes like ‘beginner’, ‘intermediate’ and
‘expert’,  or  based  on  interface  and  style
preferences.  Quentin-Baxter  and  Dewhurst
(1999) deal with this issue in an educational
context. The crucial differences with AHS are
that in these systems the adaptation uses a
much more fine-grained user model, and that
the adaptation is achieved automatically instead
of being ‘selected’ by the user.

A number of systems have been developed
and the application areas for these systems
range  from  educational  hypermedia  to
information retrieval systems with a hypertext
interface. Various research groups have
developed different techniques to adapt aspects
of hypermedia systems to the individual
characteristics of a user. Brusilovsky (1996)
gives    a comprehensive review of adaptive
hypermedia techniques and systems.

These systems can offer the authors of
hypertext flexible means to present information
with resulting systems that give users greater
navigational freedom.

Adaptation is a powerful way of augmenting
the functionality of a hypertext system. There
are two main areas that can be adapted within
a system, namely the links and the information
within each page (node). Adaptation of links
affects navigation within the system and
adaptation of nodes affects what and how the
information is presented to the user.

The two techniques usually used in AHS are
adaptive navigation and adaptive presentation
(Brusilovsky 1996), and they are described in
the next two sections.

4   Adaptive navigation support

Navigational adaptation aims to help users
find their goal without getting disorientated. It
does this by adapting the navigation (links) to
the goals, knowledge and other characteristics
of an individual user. Adaptive navigation
support can guide the user both directly and
indirectly and can work with large amounts of
material using simple user models. There are
several ways to adapt links and the most
popular adaptive navigation support (ANS)
techniques are described below.

•Direct guidance: A ‘next’ or ‘continue’ link

is usually shown in adaptive hypermedia

systems where the destination of this link is
the page (node) that the system determines
to be most appropriate.

•Sorting links: An adaptive system that
uses link sorting, displays a list of links

presented in an order from most relevant to
least relevant. This technique is usually
found in goal-oriented educational systems
(Hohl et al. 1996).

•Link hiding: Links leading to inappropriate

or irrelevant information are hidden from

the user.

•Link  annotation:  Link  anchors  are
presented differently depending on the

relevance of the destination; see systems
such as ELM-ART (Brusilovsky and Weber
1996) and Interbook (Brusilovsky et al.
1998) that use coloured dots as
annotations.

•Link disabling: This technique disables
inappropriate links; whether the link anchor

is visible depends on the combination of
this technique with link annotation or link
hiding.

•  Link removal:  Appropriate  links  (and
anchors) are simply removed; this works

well in lists, but removing the anchor text
does not work for running text. ISIS-Tutor
(Brusilovsky and Pesin 1998) uses link
removal.

•Map adaptation: Some hypermedia
systems provide a graphical presentation of

(part of) the link structure (Mukherjea 1999;



Benford et al. 1999); these can also be
adapted.

Another common set of AHS techniques is
known as presentational adaptation. Here the
content is changed, rather than the links.

5   Presentational adaptation

The aim of presentational adaptation is to
hide information that is of no use to the user, as
it may be irrelevant or too advanced. The
following techniques are used to accomplish
presentational adaptation.

•Conditional  text: The  conditional  text
technique  used  in  ITEM/IP  (Brusilovsky

1992) and C-Book (Kay and Kummerfeld
1994) divides all possible information about
a concept into sections, known as chunks.
Each chunk is set a condition indicating
what type of user should be presented with
that specific chunk of information. For
example, expert and novice users may be
presented with different chunks for the same
concept.

•Stretchtext: This is a technique suggested

in MetaDoc (Boyle and Encarnacion 1994)

and used in KN-AHS (Kobsa et al. 1994). In
regular hypertext, activation of a hot word
results in moving to another page with
related text, but when using stretchtext this
related text simply replaces the activated hot
word, extending the text of the current page.
For  example,  a  novice  user  with  poor
knowledge of a concept will always get
additional explanations of this concept.

•Page variants: This technique can be found

in Anatom-Tutor (Beaumont 1994) and C-

Book (Kay and Kummerfeld 1994). With this
technique  the  system  keeps  several
variations of the information presented, but
keeps it in different ways. It could be stored
as a different style or level and the system
selects the most appropriate page for the
user. Each variant is prepared for each type
of stereotypical user. For example, a novice
will be shown the information in one format,
and an expert user in a different format,
based on the user’s previous experiences
and interests.

•Fragment variants: A good example is
Anatom-Tutor (Beaumont 1994) where a

page is broken into a number of fragments
and a number of variants of each fragment
are prepared. The system stores several
different explanations and the user is shown
the page corresponding to their knowledge
of the concepts presented in the page.

•F r a m e - b a s e d : In this technique, the
information about a particular concept is

represented in a frame, as found within
Hypadapter (Hohl et al. 1996). Slots of a
frame  can  contain  several  explanation
variants of the concept, links to other
frames, examples, and so on.

In the next section the WANTIT system and
the AHS techniques it uses specifically to adapt
the  information  within  the  system  are
discussed. The way in which the system builds
a  model  of  the  goals,  preferences  and
knowledge of each individual user and the way
it uses this model throughout the interaction
with the user are also discussed.

6 The WANTIT system

The system developed is known as the
wireless and adaptive navigation site to help IT
college  students  (WANTIT).  The  WANTIT
system holds information on an ICT course
taught at North Tyneside College, in the United
Kingdom. The system is designed to enable
students to access course information, such as
class notes, assignments, links to important
information and news, and is viewed through a
mobile (cell) phone. WANTIT uses typical AHS
techniques to present its users with appropriate
information.

The adaptive system creates three sets of
lists  that  the  system  feels  are  the  most
appropriate for that user and displays the links
in a ‘suggestion list’. This suggestion list is
found once the user logs into the system and
can be viewed at any time while the user is
using the system.

The  ‘suggestion  list’  is  split  into  three
separate areas. These areas are: 'popular
links', 'predicted links' and 'previous links' and
are created by using a combination of three
adaptive navigation support (ANS) techniques.
The three techniques are direct guidance, link
sorting and link hiding which are used to display
links within the ‘suggestion list’, which the
system  deems  to  be  the  most  relevant
information to the user.

The ‘suggestion list’ is split like this because
of the limited space on the screen; it saves the
user time not having to scroll through the list to
find what link they are looking for. The three
sections of links found within the ‘suggestion
list’ are ordered with the top link using the direct
guidance technique. However, in the WANTIT
system the ‘next’ link is replaced with the name
of the page that the system feels is the
appropriate ‘next’ link.

The links in all three sections are ordered
using the sorting technique; they also apply a
user model and a Markov model (Cormack and
Horspool 1987) to predict which links are most



and least relevant. Both the user model and the
Markov model will be discussed in Sections 7
and 8 and the results from using these models
are displayed in the ‘suggestion list’. The top
three links in the ‘suggestion list’ are shown to
the user, while the other links that the system
predicts are not so relevant are hidden.

Since the system is optimised for use on a
mobile phone, which has a limited screen size
only allowing four lines of text to be viewed, it is
not possible to use navigation techniques such
as  link  annotation,  link  disabling  or  map
adaptation.  The  adaptation  of  the  content
(presentation adaptation) and the techniques
associated with it, such as stretchtext, are not
used within the adaptive system because of the
lack  of  space  on  the  screen.  Other
presentational techniques were not used, as the
adaptive system has only one set of content for
each user and if the user is simply not ready to
access certain content, they are not given a link
to it.

Within the system, a user model and a
Markov model are used to determine which links
to  manipulate  and  to  guide  users  towards
interesting  and  relevant  information.  These
topics are discussed in the following sections.

7   User modelling

The system maintains a user model for each
of its users and stores information such as
knowledge,  preferences,  background  and
experience about the user, by keeping attributes
such as ‘Has the user read this page?’ through
observing and recording their actions while they
are ‘browsing’ the site.

The information is stored in one of three
stereotypical   user   models:  beginner,
intermediate or expert. This model is used to
build a model of the goals and preferences of
each student, throughout the interaction, to
adapt it to their needs. If a user is new to the
system they use a stereotypical beginner’s user
model. As the user continues to use the system,
all their browsing information is recorded so that
their  user  model  slowly  evolves  from  a
stereotypical user model to a unique user model
only used by that particular user.

The user model develops from being classed
as a beginner through intermediate to expert as
the user progressively works through the system
and views more and more information.

The stereotypical user models are trained by
observing the users’ browsing patterns so that if
a visitor is new to a particular part of the system,
a reliable prediction about their future navigation
can be made. This is done by looking at a user
model of a similar type of user (either beginner,
intermediate or expert model) who has visited
that section of the system in the past. For

example, if a user with a user model identified
as an intermediate came to a part of the system
they had not been to before, the system could
not predict their navigational behaviour. Since
the  user  would  not  have  any  previous
knowledge of that part of the system within their
user model, the system would look at users with
a similar user model (intermediate). These user
models would be used along with a Markov
model to produce a ‘suggestion list’ of the
predicted links that similar users used when
they were at that section of the system.

8   The Markov model

The Markov model is derived from Markov
chains,  which  are  sequences  of  random
variables,  in  which  the  future  variable  is
determined based on probability. A Markov
model contains a single variable, the state, and
specifies the probability of each state and of
transiting from one state to another (Anderson
et al. 2002). An example of how a Markov
model works is discussed below.

Suppose we have five pages, we will use a 5
by 5 transition matrix, as seen in Figure 1.

(col j) 1   2   3   4   5

(row i) 1

2

3

4

5

Figure 1: Sample Markov model

The number in row i and column j are the
probabilities that you go to page j next given
that you are in page i now.

For each row you need to store the total
number (n) of times that this page has been
visited and the numbers n1, n2… n of times that
pages 1, 2… n have been visited next.

At any time, the probabilities that we use for
transition to page j are (in the simplest case):

Using this model, the student’s goal is
predicted and shown within the ‘suggestion list’
found within the WANTIT system. The links are
predicted by looking at the user model of the
current user and defining where they currently
are situated within the system or by looking at
the last page they viewed if they have just
entered the system. The probability of the future
‘next’ page (node) is then calculated in relation
to where the user is currently situated within the
system. The higher the probability, the more
confident the system feels that the user will



decide to follow that path and visit that predicted
page (node) next. Figure 2 below illustrates how
the list is dynamically produced.

Figure 2 How the list is produced

By looking at Figure 2 we can describe how
the WANTIT system works to produce the
’suggestion list’. Since the list is split into three
sections  we  shall  discuss  each  section
separately.

The 'predicted links' will be derived by looking
at the type of user model the current user is
identified as using and the current page of the
system they are viewing. The WANTIT system
will use the Markov model to predict the list of
links the current user will want to view, by
looking at the current page the user is viewing
and predict popular patterns that previous users
had followed.

The list is ordered with the highest probability
at the top and the lowest at the bottom. The one
with the highest probability is the direct guidance
link and the links found after the first four shown
are hidden because of the lack of screen space.
The titles of the pages are displayed with the
‘suggestion list’, as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3 The ‘suggestion list’

The 'popular links' section will be predicted
by using the Markov model to suggest the list of
links the current user will want to view, by
calculating the most viewed pages, by using the
last pages-visited model that users with a
similar user model have previously viewed.
Again, the list is ordered with the highest
probability at the top and the lowest at the
bottom. The one with the highest probability is
the direct link and the links found after the first
four shown are hidden.

Finally, the 'previous links' section will not
use any predictions and therefore the Markov
model is not used for this section. To create this
list of links the last four links stored in the user
model that the user viewed, will be displayed on
the screen, with the latest viewed link at the top
and the oldest at the bottom. This section is
used in case a user would like to carry on using
the system from where they had logged out of
their last session, when they had used the
system.

9   Hybrid system

As discussed by Perkowitz and Etzioni
(2000), automated approaches may not always
correctly predict the user's goal. They consider
that the best approach, as used in our system,
is a hybrid system where personalisations are
generated automatically and the web author
optionally provides guidance to enable the
correct model to be used.

The hybrid system can be useful when the
models  have  to  be  slightly  changed.  For
example, where an assignment is given out and
the tutor would like it to be viewed by all the
students as soon as possible. Using a hybrid
system, the popularity of the page can be
changed  so  that  it  is  displayed  in  the
‘suggestion list’ even if it has not been viewed
before.

10  Testing and results

An  experiment  was  conducted  to  test
whether an adaptive system is better than a
non-adaptive  system  for  use  on  a  mobile
phone. Subjecting the users alternately to two
systems  tested  the  benefits  of  adaptive
navigation.  One  system  had  no  adaptive
techniques available and the other system
contained  the  same  content,  but  had  the
combination of all three adaptive navigation
techniques.

The test was controlled with the use of a pre-
test screening questionnaire to ensure a
representative sample of 20 users of a similar
age, knowledge and experience. The 20 test
users were then split equally into two groups of

10. The first group tested the adaptive system
first while the second group tested the non-



adaptive system, followed by a crossover to
allow users to compare the merits of the two
systems.

As part of the experiment, users had 10 tasks
to complete, in which they had to find 10
different pieces of information. Once the
systems had been tested, the two experimental
groups switched over to test the other system,
keeping the experiment controlled. To make the
tests fair, both sets of groups were given some
different tasks to complete, in which they had to
find different pieces of information. Both groups
were given five different tasks and five
previously seen tasks in case they had become
accustomed to how the site was structured when
they came to test the other system for a second
time. The 10 tasks given to the 20 users when
testing the adaptive and the non-adaptive
systems were given in a different order so that
no browsing patterns could be easily seen in the
system.

The experiment recorded the paths the users
had taken, the directness of the paths, and how
long it took them to find the goal by the number
of links they visited and the time in seconds it
took them to find the relevant information. The
experiment also tested 'lostness' (how lost users
got) using the method proposed by Smith (1996)
comparing ‘the number of information items
inspected, compared with the number of items
which normally needed to be inspected to locate
the required information’.

From the results of the experiment, it was
found that of the 20 users who used the
adaptive system to complete the 10 tasks, only
two users were measured as 'lost' while using
the adaptive system, compared with four users
who were measured as lost while using the non-
adaptive system.

Examining each group in more detail, we can
see that of the first group to test the adaptive
system, seven out of the 10 users thought the
adaptive system was quicker than the non-
adaptive system, as well as easier to use. The
remaining three users thought that both systems
were the same in quickness and ease of use.
Examining the data collected in the user models,
seven out of the 10 users were actually timed in
seconds as being quicker, with an average of
11% while using the adaptive system, and with a
mean saving of 1.74 links in each task. Eight of
the users said they preferred the adaptive
system, even though it was slower than the non-
adaptive system for one of these users.

Looking at the second group, who tested the
adaptive system last, eight of the 10 users
thought that the adaptive system was quicker
than the non-adaptive system. However, when
examining the data collected in the user models,
only five of the 10 users were actually timed in

seconds as being quicker, while using the
adaptive system, and the other users were
actually timed as being slower by an average of
only 1%. It was also noted that seven users
thought that the adaptive system was easier to
use and by looking at the data collected, a
mean of 1.22 links were saved in each task
while using the adaptive system. Of the 10
users, eight said they preferred the adaptive
system even though the adaptive system was
slower than the non-adaptive system for five of
these users.

11  Conclusions

In conclusion, websites that are designed for
viewing on wireless devices require careful
content management as these devices are
characterised by their high operating costs,
limited  screen  size  and  limited  navigation
capability (Jari et al. 2000). With the use of a
user model that contains information about the
user, such as their goals, interests, preferences
and knowledge, suggestions can be made with
the help of a Markov model to help create a
personalised  and  adaptive  site.  Using
personalisation  and  adaptive  navigation
techniques within the WANTIT system students
will not waste time and effort looking through
course material that is inappropriate to their
needs. The WANTIT system has shown that the
users can reach their goal (the information they
are looking for) as quickly and efficiently as
possible without getting 'lost' and they can do
this in an environment they prefer and find easy
to use.

Abstract

To  ensure  that  classroom-based  pupils
benefit from the experience of a field trip being
undertaken by their peers, investigations are
underway within the RAFT project to provide a
cooperative learning environment spanning the
field trip and the classroom. Various roles are
being explored to ensure that all participants are
fully engaged in the event. The background to
this investigation is the need to embed the
experience within the curriculum, and to explore
the event within peer-based learning, situated
learning  and  vicarious  learning  pedagogic
principles.

Keywords: field trips, cooperative learning

1. Introduction

The Remote Accessible Field Trip (RAFT)
project is implementing a method of spanning
field trip and classroom locations to provide an
integrated event for the set of pupils involved.
This will take the practice of mobile learning into
the realms of fully cooperative and collaborative
learning.

To ensure that all pupils are fully engaged in
the event, the project team is exploring a range
of roles that could be taken by the pupils. The
scope of these roles is being explored, together
with the qualities that will be developed in the
pupils taking these roles.

A variety of scenarios are being explored,
focusing on the areas of biology, art and history.
The curriculum is being considered within the
secondary education systems of Canada,
Scotland, Germany and Slovakia.

Prototype systems are being constructed
based on innovative classroom technologies and
on mobile devices in the field. Initially a variety of
simple scenarios are being enacted with school
pupils to explore the nature of the roles that
might be necessary and the functionality
required of the systems to enable these roles to
be enacted. In addition, trial field trips have
taken place to explore the interactions between

the classrooms and the field trip and the
capabilities  of  the  current  wide  area
technologies, while anticipating the capabilities
of the future infrastructures.

This paper will report on this initial work and
highlight the nature of the collaboration being
explored and the place of roles within the
mobile learning situation.

2. Curriculum and pedagogies

Along with the development of this approach
to field trips, investigations into the current state
of field trips and the curricula in various
countries are being investigated. Despite the
recognised educational worth of field trips there
are many limiting factors, such as time in the
curriculum, health and safety, insurance and
staffing which inhibit the number of these
activities (Barker et al. 2002). It is hoped that
this approach to field trips will help alleviate
these problems by only removing a small group
of students from the school but also that it will
provide an even richer educational experience
for all students.

Comparisons of curricula in various countries
have been made. There are enough common
areas in the curricula to be able to develop
European and internationally relevant field trips.
To ensure that the field trips are worthwhile they
are designed to fit the curricula of each of the
participating countries by consulting and
working with teachers in each of the countries
involved.

The field trips that have been proposed by
practising teachers at RAFT workshops are
noted in a RAFT portal (www.raft-project.net)
and  some  have  been  chosen  to  be  fully
developed  for  the  project  and  to  provide
exemplar field trips for future use.

The learning theories and pedagogies
appropriate to RAFT include collaborative and
cooperative learning, situated learning (Lave
and Wenger 1991), peer-assisted learning
(Topping and Ehly 1998) and vicarious learning
(Lee et al. 1999). Examples of where these may
occur are noted in Table 1.

RAFT examples

Field trips present many real-life
practical problems to be solved and
demands from several directions.
Examples: visiting and interviewing
a professional – an artist in their
studio, a journalist at work, a
scientist in the laboratory.

Working with peers in the field and
in the classroom; distributed working
with other students in different parts
of the world on topics of mutual
interest.

Group tasks, eg on pollution in river.
Within the group there are roles, eg
r e s e a r c h e r , c o m m u n i c a t o r ,
measurer, collator and developer.
Each contributes to achieve the joint
result – a ‘jigsaw’ process.

In the field, a visually impaired
student may be assigned a student
to  be his/her visual helper – the two
work together gathering information
for their group.

A student takes the role of process
observer in a group investigating the
Roman Army. The student ‘learns’
different techniques from observing
other groups’ approaches to their
tasks. This is ‘meta-learning’.

To make the learning experience valuable
with only a few students in the field and most of
the students in the classroom, the field trip, as
well as having to be well organised and
planned, should allow all students to be and feel
involved. To achieve this a cooperative

approach to learning has been adopted
(Johnson and Johnson 1994). Each student has
a particular role in a group each of which has a
specific task. All students are working towards a
common goal and each student’s contribution is
important.

The initial roles proposed include, in the
classroom: classroom coordinator, classroom
communicator, researchers and archivist and, in
the field: field communicator, scouts, data
gatherers and annotators. These are shown in
Figure 2.

3. Functional overview of the RAFT
system

There are many facets to this proposed
approach to field trips. These include planning,
coordinating and evaluating the field trip as well
as managing the users, their learning and the
collaborative learning environment. There could
be other classrooms and experts from anywhere
in the world participating in the field trip in real
time thus extending the collaborative learning
experience. The proposed system is defined in
Figure 1.

Figure 2 Some of the field-trip roles

Figure 1 Functional overview of RAFT system



From initial trials, the most effective field trips

– with interaction and a feeling of involvement
from all students – have occurred when the
classroom coordinator has shown leadership
skills and has taken responsibility for driving the
communication. Field trips have also worked
more smoothly when the archivist has been
familiar with the presentation software.

It is also emerging from initial prototyping that
each person in a group needs a uniquely defined
role and these roles may include researcher,
communicator, analyst, collator and developer.
Therefore, there may be several of each of these
in the classroom depending on the number of
tasks  and  groups  involved.  The  classroom
should be busy with activity from before direct
communication  with  the  field-trip  site  is
established to after the field-trip activity has been
completed.

5. Role of the learning management
system

In  addition to  providing  an educational
experience, the data gathered and generated by
the students can be stored as learning objects
and re-used by others in the class for their
particular task, in future years, by other classes
and by others who have access to the learning
management system (LMS). It may be that as
the project develops the whole potential of the
LMS is utilised in terms of controlling and
monitoring the students’ educational experience
and progress but at this stage it is the re-usable
learning objects (RLOs) that are of interest to the
RAFT project.

6. Technology

As the nature of the approach is to have
students communicate from remote places to
classrooms,  wireless  communication  is
important. Various types including Bluetooth, 3G
and wireless local area networks (WLAN) are
being investigated for suitability.

Personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablets
and laptops are all being trialled for suitability of
use for students on the move and in classrooms
and for suitability of running available software.
Customised interfaces are being developed from
input from students in the classroom and
prototypes are being tested. The idea of mobile
computing is also being prototyped with ideas
about designs and preferences for new devices
being developed in discussions with students.

7. Issues being explored

The project is developing quickly and many
issues have emerged. These include:

� networking:  wireless technology,
suitability and reliability

�  collaborative tools: whiteboards, video
conferencing, text and mobile phones as
reserves

�  learning delivery tools: LMS with RLOs,
future role of metadata

�classroom – the design of the future
classroom (DfES 2002, Tinzmann et al.
1990)

�field trip – decisions about what type of
devices will be useful and will they be
designed specifically for children

�interfaces – issues such as having a
common interface

�roles – decisions on the role of the
archivist and the amount of responsibility
(s)he is given

�file  transfer  from  field  to  class
management

�setting  up  a  collaborative  learning
environment

�  methods for teachers to find out about
and participate in RAFT.

8. Future work

RAFT is at the prototyping stage and for the
next year the data gathered will be used in the
development stage. After that full field-trip trials
will occur and these will be evaluated in a
comprehensive manner covering many areas
from learning efficiency to effectiveness of
video-conferencing.

At all stages communication and cooperation
with schools, teachers and students will
continue to ensure functionality and suitability.
This should result in a system that is accepted
by teachers, where they are sure that the
content  is  curriculum-specific  and  the
technology is used naturally and appropriately
to enhance the educational experience.

Abstract

The current social trend towards learning
during leisure time, together with the rapid
development of advances in mobile technology,
gives  rise to the vision of enabling consumers to
learn any time, anywhere. However, until
recently there have been relatively few attempts
to explore the learning opportunities presented
by mobile devices systematically. This article
investigates the importance of starting from the
mobile user’s perspective with a conceptual
framework for developing mobile applications for
learning. It includes the results of a mobile
commerce expert survey, carried out by IAMSR
Research in five different countries, to illustrate
the impact of cultural differences in user
behaviour on the potential success of mobile
learning applications. It was found that time,
information and location dimensions delineate
the impact on users' contexts and the selection
of innovative mobile technology, and together
with our results suggest the design of a mobile
system for language learning.

Keywords: mobile system, overlapping
contexts, leisure and learning

1. Leisure and the learning society

Leggiere (2002) argues that it is both evident
and ironic that progress in information
technology (IT) has resulted in more work in our
society. However, in the early 21ˢᵗ century
societal expectation might be that there would
be  a global increase in the amount of leisure
because of the new and pervasive productivity-
enhancing technologies, given that the internet
and mobile wireless communications have freed
businesses from the constraints of working at a
specific time and place. Technology does indeed
simplify routine tasks, for example sending e-
mail messages instead of fax messages, linking
electronic databases globally rather than using
local libraries, and so on. Moreover, technology
also saves us time, which people can use to
work on other tasks. Thus, it can be argued that

technology often does not save any time, but
erases boundaries between work and leisure
activities. The new paradigm of being able to
undertake all tasks, all the time, is a warning of
our complicated lifestyles.

Historically, at the same time as the mobile
device became affordable for many people in
both industrialised and developing countries, it
also turned into a mass tool of the 21ˢᵗ century
by  creating  newfound  freedoms  in  users’
personal lives. With the increasing level of
functionalities, mobile devices are increasingly
used for entertainment. Consequently, one of
the core issues in this paper is how to improve
the effective use of leisure time in a knowledge-
based society.

The rapid development of information and
communications  technology  (ICT)  has
contributed to greater economic choice and
higher social prestige for consumers. There is
evidence  that  ICT  is  reshaping  consumer
behaviour in the following ways:

•  individual preferences have shifted from
mass production to mass customisation

•self-service allows users to respond to new
business opportunities instantly and react

quickly to changes

•  consumers are becoming ‘smart shoppers’,
spending their money increasingly

strategically – product quality is perceived
in an extremely rational price–performance
trade-off (Meffert 2000).

The  rising  level  of  education  is  another
powerful  variable  shaping  very  distinct
consumer and organisational behaviour (Falk
and  Dierking  2002).  Continuous  learning,
learning  during  leisure  time,  grows  more
important, because considerable investment in
personal  development  and  education  is
necessary to compete in the global economy.
Knowledge-intensive  workers  have  more
resources and are more aware of change and
technology.  However,  they  can  suffer  from
information overload. Therefore, our knowledge
society can be characterised as ‘time-poor’ and
‘money-rich’  (Lindskog  and  Brege  2003).
Learners in a knowledge society want their
leisure learning to meet their individual interests



and needs (Wikström 2000), so demand for
tailored, contextualised and responsive learning
is rising. Traditional institutions for continuing
education can be perceived as being barely
connected to their students. In fact, they are
unable  to establish a dynamic interaction on a
real-time basis outside the classroom or to
provide personalised information at the point of
need. Continuous learning during leisure time
already happens; so learning organisations are
starting to borrow ideas from e-commerce.

Another trend is the multi-ethnic nature of
current society, as a result of emigration,
students studying abroad and a growing number
of international corporations.  In developed
countries this has led to a prominent number of
newcomers, or foreigners, seeking to be
integrated into the local society; perhaps first by
learning the local language. To consider how
wireless technologies are being adapted to meet
changing educational needs, the authors looked
at language-learning systems on mobile
devices.  Mobile solutions are only effective
when people feel that they add value or bring
new freedom. An important question is how to
create a mobile system for language learning,
which has added-value features for its user. The
next sections note how the factors contributing
to the development of a successful mobile
system for language learning were investigated.

2.  Conceptual  framework  for
designing  a  prototype  mobile
learning language system

High added-value applications in mobile
commerce are  becoming some of the most
popular topics of interest in information systems
(IS) research. They are also a core activity for
many businesses operating in the  wireless
world. Scholars exploring mobile markets in
different countries are likely to have different
perceptions of what kind of mobile services will
be the most popular. On the other hand, they
share quite similar views on the success of the
design of services for mobile products, that is,
designing from the customer’s perspective.

Context-aware mobile applications, which adapt
their behaviour to the environmental context, are
an important class of applications in emerging
mobile systems; the most commonly researched
area in mobile context studies is the physical
location of the mobile user. Examples include:

• location-aware applications that
enable users to discover the

resources available in their physical
proximity (Harter et al. 1999 ;
Priyantha et al. 2000)

•active maps that automatically
change as the user moves (Schilit et

al. 1994)

• applications whose user interfaces
adapt to the user’s location.

Another aspect of the context in past research
is related to the orientation of device position
both indoors (Bahl, Padmanabhan 2000) and
outdoors (Priyantha et al. 2000). A number of
papers have focused on the creation and
evaluation of location-aware mobile systems,
called  the e-guide (Cheverst et al. 2000). Here,
the researchers have found a surprisingly high
level of acceptability across a wide range of
users. However, they also evaluated users’
frustration while using a system at their current
location and not being able to query the
system  for further information. The main
conclusion drawn from these studies is that
context-aware systems are not affected by the
design   of the user interface alone. They are

also governed by the design of the
infrastructure that supports them. Groot and
Welie  (2002) analyse a mobile context of use
and define it as a user’s ecosystem in the
sense that it presents many design challenges,
and that context of use is crucial for increasing
service value and solving usability problems:

Even though the industry likes to talk about
'virtual services', people with their millions of
years of history of handling artefacts, will
probably view the mobile Internet as a, what
we call, 'ecosystem of connected terminals',
where the interaction with each terminal is
dependent on the context of use.

Context of use (screen size and colour depth,
input mechanisms, network latencies, etc) can
be seen as the key challenge arising from the
differences between traditional web design and
micro design for mobile devices.

These studies all point to the importance of
the context of use, and this should be governed
by the user’s overall ecosystem, rather than by
the physical location alone. To develop an in-
depth understanding of the widespread take-up
of mobile applications, we need to appreciate
the conditional elements of System Theory

(Bertalanffy 1962). The System  Holism
principle, derived from System Theory claims
that   ‘it is necessary for a system to have
functional parts that communicate … where the
sum  of the parts is greater than the parts added
together’.  In analysing the relationships
between  the different success factors of
information system artefacts, we present a
conceptual framework that can be used to



justify the most appropriate context of mobile
learning.

3. Contexts of mobile learning

Establishing the right contextual model is a
starting point for the design of any mobile
system for consumers. We discovered that a
typical mobile user is involved in a number of
different overlapping contexts (Falk and Dierking
2002), thus any activity and experience that
result are influenced by the interactions between
these contexts. The definition of an overlapping
context is not new, though it has generally not
been emphasised in IS research. The contextual
model used by Falk and Dierking (2002) implies
that overlapping contexts contribute to and
influence the interactions and experiences that
people have when performing certain activities.
Our  suggestion  is  that  there  are  three
overlapping contexts – the personal mobile, the
learning community (which exists in virtual,
physical, or both forms, depending on where the
learning  interaction  with  other  community
members occurs) and the cultural. Together they
contribute to the design of experiences that
people have when engaging in mobile learning.
This can be seen in Figure 1, which introduces
the principle of System Holism in that it suggests
that the existing contexts of mobile learning and
the mobile system for language learning can
combine for a smooth user experience.

depend on a network of mobile users. It can be
useful to consider this in relation to the network
economic theory (Shapiro and Varian 1999),
which claims that the value of the network
increases and costs decrease with a growing
number of users. In other words, the common
logic suggests that the value of a product within
a network depends on the product adoption
behaviour of other users. An important point to
note is that there are the two contexts – the
physical and the mobile – that overlap. Thus,
the language learning experience, and any
activity  that  results,  is  influenced  by  the
interactions between these contexts.

It is also important to consider the cultural
context of use when designing a mobile system.
Relationships  exist  between  usability  and
culture (Hillier 2003). As a proof of reference we
present the results of a mobile commerce
expert survey, carried out by Carlsson and
Walden (2002) at the Institute for Advanced
Management  Systems  Research  in  five
different countries. The results suggest that
cultural  differences  in  usage  behaviour
characterise the potential success of mobile
learning  applications.  Thirty-one  interviews
were conducted with national mobile commerce
experts in Finland and Hong Kong. It could be
argued that this is a limited population from
which to make comparisons between the two
countries. But the business of developing m-
commerce applications and services is just
beginning  and  there  are  still  only  a  few
companies operating in this area in either
Finland or Hong Kong – countries considered to
have very high-tech oriented infrastructures.

Figure 2. Expert opinion on the potential
success of mobile learning and mobile
education in Finland and Hong Kong

The respondents from Finland and Hong
Kong had different perceptions of mobile
learning (see Figure 2) because they originated
in different cultural contexts and well-defined
educational systems. The theory of cultural



differences published by Edward Hall in 1976
assumes a strong linkage to exist between
culture and communication. He used general
terms ‘high context’ and ‘low context’ to describe
cultural differences between societies. High
context refers to societies or groups where
people have very few but close connections over
a long period of time, with less verbally explicit
communication and written/formal information
involved. Many aspects of cultural behaviour are
not made explicit because most members are
linked from years of interaction with each other.
In  low-context  cultures  the  context  carries
relatively little information, where people tend to
have many connections but of shorter duration.
In these societies, cultural behaviour and beliefs
may need to be spelled out explicitly so that the
listener wants to get lots of information, and to
have it at once. The following ethnographic
study revealed that both Finland and Hong Kong
have elements of high-context cultures and both
were  identified  as  supporting  innovation.
However, strong differences existed in their
educational culture and funding mechanisms. In
Hong  Kong,  education  is  mainly  privately
funded; in Finland education is government
funded. In Hong Kong, people prefer to learn at
home in quiet surroundings because the pace of
life is hectic and they already have contact with
others  during  the  day.  This  contrasts  with
Finland, where people work in a more isolated
fashion and regard learning as a semi-social
activity.

This overlapping of contexts opens up a
variety of different features and attributes that
influence  the  correct  definition  of  user
requirements and the appropriate design of the
overall mobile system.

4.  Innovation with voice technology

We have chosen to describe the freedom of
learning as a process, evolving within different
dimensions  including  time,  information  and
location. Our basic assumption is that time,
information and location have implications for
the learning society, which is eager to transfer
and share knowledge effectively through the use
of  mobile  communication  technology.
Researchers have long recognised that media
vary in terms of their information richness; that
is, ‘the way in which an environment presents
information  to  senses’  (Steuer  1992).  The
overlapping contexts – the mobile (which is
highly personal) and the physical (characteristics
of the features of a community the user belongs
to) – should be considered within the scale of
time and information. A location-based service
can also offer value to the users. For example, if

users want to learn about nature, they can go to
a park. Such location-dependent learning can
increase the sensual experience and enhance
language learning. The idea behind this is that
the interface designed for language learning is
appropriate during the usage time; that is, it
should not be too complex or too simple. The
three  underlying  parameters  of  mobile
communication  require  different  ways  of
presenting information to the senses, thus
assisting  in  the  selection  of  appropriate
technological solutions to create a positive
experience of mobile learning. The sharing of
extensive information within a non-specified
time frame does not require the sender and
receiver to be in the same place at the same
time. Using voice technology to provide a rich
media content for the user solves the current
limitations of input and output mechanisms of
mobile devices.  Moreover it is an innovative
solution in terms of mobility and contextual
learning.

The  main  results  of  the  study  can  be
translated  into  a  general  mobile-learning
prototype for learning the Finnish language (see
Figure 3). This system has multilingual content,
but the information is in a single language
specified by the user when first subscribing to
the profile. The ‘learner’ can click words (such
as ‘vocabulary’, ‘topics’ and ‘milestones’) on a
screen and specify in which language they want
to receive that information. It is suggested that
the learning be divided into milestones for
tracking the user’s personal progress. If using a
mobile phone, it can deliver small lessons in
Finnish using both sound and text. Through the
use  of  mobile  headphones,  a  ‘Language
Learning Guide’ is able to explain the main
grammar rules within the vocabulary section, in
order to introduce each of the contextual topics
according to the personal profile. For example,
push technology enables the user to post the
most recent news to sections created for use by
teachers and groups. Probably the oldest and
most widely used push technology is e-mail.
This is a push technology because you receive
mail whether you ask for it or not – that is, the
sender pushes the message to the receiver.
SMS and MMS alerts are expected to be used
for  retrieving  problematic  or  time-critical
information and can also direct the learner to
tutor support. Posting an alert can catch the
attention of whichever students and teacher are
available at the time for a face-to-face meeting.

In our prototype we address the small screen
size constraints and limited amount of text
information by using voice technology that can
relay more information.


yet unknown m-education market is problematic
and requires further in-depth research. Using
simple but critical dimensions of the mobile
communication and contextual learning for
marketing purposes will contribute to the design
of meaningful and therefore successful mobile
applications and services.

Being  first  is  a  challenge  facing  many
institutions  developing  mobile  learning
products.  The  authors  consider  that  the
development of mobile learning is inevitable in
the future: educational institutions have no
choice unless they want to become an isolated,
old-fashioned,  elitist  sector  outside  the
mainstream of society. We consider that further
research is necessary so that mobile systems
with value-adding solutions will facilitate but not
replace conventional learning.

In an ideal case, the user can move freely
within the different environments in accordance
with the context of the selected topic, and listen
to the correct pronunciation of the language
through earphones. An implementation of such a
mobile system, designed to meet the particular
needs of leisure students, requires further
research before such freedom of learning can be
realised.

5. Further research

One of the most modern, inexpensive and
convenient  ways  of  helping  visitors  or
newcomers to learn the basics of a foreign
language  is  being  developed  using  mobile
phones. Mobile education influences not only
the students, but also the lecturers. Therefore
many  educational  aspects  and  teacher’s
usability issues need to be considered. The
possibilities offered by the third-generation (3G)
mobile networks are immense. They have the
potential  to  increase  the  interactivity  and
personalisation of applications and services with
video, audio and text data. Mobile solutions are
only effective when people feel that they add
value, are cost-effective and reliable. First, data
must be gathered about students and teachers’
needs to generate ideas for future products and
services  that  could  fulfil  their  expectations.
Second, managerial considerations on gaining
the critical mass are necessary to make the
applications  financially  attractive.  Therefore

Abstract

The MOBIlearn project (EU IST-2001-37187)
aims to support a wide range of services and
applications for learners using mobile computing
devices such as phones, personal digital
assistants (PDAs) and laptops. The display
limitations of these devices mean that it is
crucial  to deliver the right content and services
at the right time. One way of doing this is to use
contextual information to derive content that is
relevant to what the user is doing, as well as
where and how they are doing it. We present an
object-oriented, feature-based architecture for a
context- awareness  subsystem  to  be
implemented within the MOBIlearn project, and
consider the implications involved in the use of
such a system for mobile learning.

Keywords: context awareness, e-learning,
mobile computing, m-learning

1. Mobile learning in MOBIlearn

MOBIlearn is a worldwide, European-led
research and development project exploring
context-sensitive approaches to the application
of   mobile technology to informal, problem-based
and workplace learning. The MOBIlearn system
will deploy a generic mobile learning architecture
based on sub-systems that interact through web
protocols to provide relevant and timely learning
content and services.

Context management is a key sub-system
that delivers content appropriate to the learner's
goals, situation and resources. Context aware-
ness is a highly desirable feature for mobile

computing devices – for a recent review see
Chen and Kotz (2000), and some examples of
current projects include Kolari (2003) and
Chalmers et al. (2003).

People on the move need information
relevant to their location and immediate needs.
The display capabilities of mobile devices are
restricted  when  compared  to  desktop
alternatives and the mobile communications
channel may have limited bandwidth, so the
sub-system must match the content to the
available display and communications, and also
to  the learner's needs and preferences. It is
also important for a mobile device to provide
services (such as collaboration tools) and user
options (such as interaction preferences) that
are appropriate to the situation of use.

1.1.  Context awareness for mobile
learning

Context  awareness  in  MOBIlearn  is
implemented as a context-awareness  sub-
system (CAS) that selects content reflecting
the requirements of a specific individual and
then presents this content with minimal user
effort.

There are two potential advantages to this
approach:

•it reduces the need to define search terms
and perform a content search

•the system is usable while the person is
engaged in another activity.

The usefulness of this approach has already
been demonstrated by Bristow et al. (2002) who
showed that simple sensor input indicating user
status could provide effective context-



dependent content provision. For example, a
user walking past the library sees a link to the
library homepage on a head-up display (a
compact  display  unit  that  can  present
information to the wearer without obscuring their
view of the world), and if they stand still they are
presented with a brief version of the page itself.
If they then sit down, they see the page in full.

In broad terms, the aim of the CAS is to
provide a means by which users of mobile
devices can maintain their attention on the world
around or the task at hand, while their mobile
devices provide timely and effective computer
support. The CAS provides a mechanism by
which relevant content can be selected, filtered,
and passed to the user. Users can then either
look at the content or select other content from
the filtered set.

MOBIlearn aims to provide users with a rich
and flexible learning experience, and therefore
‘content’ includes not only learning objects or
materials per se but also resources, services,
and options that might be relevant to the learner
in their current context. For instance, other
learners themselves might constitute resources
in a learning environment, and users should be
offered the opportunity to make contact when
appropriate. By including services, we aim to
address the need to make learning content
available from a variety of sources, not limited to
the content set available immediately to the user
in their current location.

There are many examples of varied uses of
different elements of contextual data but there is
no over-arching architectural approach. What we
are  concentrating  on  for  MOBIlearn  is
developing a re-usable architecture for a wide
range of applications and scenarios. This is in
line  with  the  general  MOBIlearn  aim  of
producing a reference architecture for mobile
learning  that  affords  flexible  re-use  and
application to a wide range of mobile learning
scenarios. Our aim is to produce a simple, yet
powerful, approach to building context-aware
applications that non-expert users can easily
customise for their own needs.

1.2.Scenarios of use

The development of content and delivery
mechanisms within MOBIlearn is based around
the development of learning scenarios in three
key areas: Master of Business Administration
(MBA) students, museum visits and health-
care/first-aid provision. All these areas provide
rich contexts of use that can determine what
content is appropriate for a given user at a given
time.  For example, MBA students travelling on
the train can be given a short multiple-choice
quiz that downloads quickly to their mobile

phone; art-history students following a study
guide  around  a  museum  can  be  offered
relevant content whenever they stop in front of
specific art works; and a first-aider in the field
can be given just-in-time advice by a device
that is able to respond to the severity of injury,
distance to the nearest medical facilities and
the experience of the person administering the
first aid.

1.3.Approaches to context awareness

A survey of the current literature concerning
context-aware computing indicates that there
are two main approaches to building context-
aware artefacts. The technologically  driven
approach is focused on what capabilities can be
provided by the available hardware and soft-
ware. For context-aware applications, this is
usually a case of determining what data can be
obtained through sensors and what processing
can be carried out on that data by the available
devices – see Want et al. (1992) and Abowd et
al.(1997) for some examples.

Conversely, the application-driven approach
concentrates on what capabilities are required
by a particular learning application or context of
use, including the requirements of the user(s)
themselves. Some examples relevant to this
alternative approach can be found in Lueg
(2002) and van Laerhoven (1999).

We aim to reconcile these two approaches
by maintaining an awareness of current
technical capabilities and limitations as well as
taking into account the needs of learners in the
scenarios for which we are developing. This
means that we are aiming to provide learners
with a flexible context-awareness system that
can react to their needs as anticipated by
authors, publishers and developers, and also to
their direct input should the need arise. One of
our primary assumptions is that the system
could fail or make an erroneous judgement at
any time, and that users need to have the
opportunity to influence and correct the system.

1.4. Describing context

Our starting point in a definition of context is
to identify the purpose of the context we are
interested in. For MOBIlearn, the purpose is
learning,  specifically  learning  on  mobile
devices, and so our approach to describing
context and applying this description to produce
a usable software architecture is based on this
focus. Figure 1 shows the basic hierarchy for
our description of context.

Instead of a rigid definition, our intention is to
provide a hierarchical description of context as
a dynamic process with historic dependencies.



By this we mean that context is a set of
changing relationships that may be shaped by
the history of those relationships. For example, a
learner visiting a museum for the second time
could have his or her content recommendations
influenced by their activities on a previous visit.

connected to a content delivery subsystem,
which in turn is linked to the context engine.
The  mobile  device  passes  contextual
information obtained from sensors, user input,
and user profile to the context subsystem which
then compares this metadata to the content
metadata provided by the delivery subsystem
and returns a set of content recommendations.
These  recommendations  are  used  by  the
delivery subsystem to determine which content
to deliver to the learner.

A snapshot of a particular point in the ongoing
context process can be captured in a context
state. A context state contains all the elements
currently present within the ongoing context
process that are relevant to a particular learning
focus, such as the learner’s current project,
episode or activity.

A context  substate  is  the  set  of  those
elements from the context state that are directly
relevant to the current learning and application
focus, that is to say those things that are useful
and usable for the current learning system.

Context features are the individual elements
found within a context substate and each refers
to one specific item of information about the
learner or their setting (for example, current
learning task or location).

Implementing context awareness within our
architecture is a matter of deriving a context
substate  and  using  the  context  features
contained within it to determine what content
might be appropriate.

2. Context-awareness architecture

The basic representation of how the context-
awareness system functions as part of the
MOBIlearn content delivery system is illustrated

The basic cycle of operation of our context-
awareness system is as follows:

1.input – of context metadata
2.construction – of context substate
3.exclusion – of unsuitable content
4.ranking – of remaining content
5.output – of ranked list of content.

The CAS comprises a set of software objects
called context features that correspond to real-
world context features relating to the learner’s
setting, activity, device capabilities and so on to
derive a context substate, as described above.
Data can be acquired through either automated
means (for example sensors or other software
subsystems) or can be input directly by the
user. This context substate is used to perform
first exclusion of any unsuitable content (for
example high-resolution web pages that cannot
be displayed on a PDA) and then ranking of the
remaining content to determine the best n
options. This ranked set of options is then
output to the content delivery subsystem.

The following sections explain the operating
principles underlying the context features,
beginning with an outline of the kinds of
metadata we anticipate using in the system,
followed by a description of the context feature



software objects that perform the context
processing.

2.1. Use of metadata

The primary purpose of CAS is to perform
intelligent  matching  between  metadata  on
learning materials, services and options (content
metadata) and metadata on the learner and their
setting (context metadata). By looking for
content metadata that matches the metadata of
the current context, the system can make
recommendations  about  what  content  is
appropriate.

Figure 3: Context awareness and metadata

Metadata

2.3. Acquiring context metadata

We have identified two main aspects of the
learner’s context, namely their setting (including
physical location, objects and people in close
proximity, and available resources) and the
learner themselves (including their current
activities, goals and learner profile).

Setting metadata

Any context-aware application or service
depends on being able to obtain contextual
information from the user’s environment or
setting.  For  the  MOBIlearn  system,  we
anticipate relying on both automated input from
sensors and other software, and input from the
user themselves about their state and the state
of the world.

Some  possibilities  for  automated  input
include the use of location data derived from

tracking a device within a wireless Local Area
Network (LAN), and the use of infra-red or radio
frequency (RF) tags to signal the proximity of
nearby objects. Wireless network tracking is
becoming an increasingly feasible option with
the availability of software such as Ekahau’s
Positioning  Engine  (see  www.ekahau.com)


This process is illustrated in Figure 3 –

context metadata from the learner and their
setting is matched to content metadata drawn
from the set of available learning materials,
options and resources.

There are two crucial prerequisites for the
successful completion of this process. First,
available content must be appropriately marked
up with a suitable metadata schema. Second,
the  system  must  have  access  to  relevant
metadata about the context, ie the learner and
their setting.

2.2. Acquiring content metadata

For our first prototypes we are anticipating the
use of a metadata schema being developed as
part of a PhD at the University of Birmingham by
Chan. This schema is based on the draft IEEE
learning objects metadata schema (IEEE 2002)
and includes extra elements appropriate to our
approach to context and our desired level of
context awareness.

Work is underway to build a database of
content suitable for the MOBIlearn project, and it
is  anticipated  that  the  learning  content
management subsystem will handle this content
and all associated metadata, making it available
to other architecture components as required.

which can use wireless LAN signals to locate a
device to within a few metres, and RF tags are
also  looking  promising  as  a  way  of
implementing  cheap  and  robust  object
identifiers. Also, since many handheld devices
now feature Bluetooth technology as standard,
this is another way in which RF technologies
could  be  used  for  identification  and
communication  purposes  within  a  context-
aware application framework.

Learner metadata

Users also create their own context, and we
anticipate the use of contextual metadata
relating to both the user status (including their
current goals and activities) and learner model.

User status includes the user’s current goals,
intentions, activities and routines. Cognitive
states such as goals and intentions can only be
acquired accurately by asking the user to
describe them, for example through forms or
checklists, but the user’s activities and routines
could be inferred directly. Bristow et al. (2002)
have used accelerometers, either on the body
or on a handheld computer, to detect whether a
user is walking, standing or sitting. This can be
combined with location data to tailor the display
of information.

A learner model is a computer representation
of the learner’s  current  knowledge,
misunderstandings, styles and strategies of



learning. Learner modelling has formed an
important part of research into the design of
intelligent tutoring systems (see, for example,
Anderson et al., 1995, Brusilovsky et al., 1996).
The  learner  model  can  be  based  on  the
system’s assessment of the learner’s:

•knowledge or misconceptions

•  learning style

•  motivation

•  progress in solving a problem (see Jameson
2003 for more details).

The LISP Tutor of Anderson et al. (1995)
employed the technique of knowledge tracing. It
represented teaching knowledge as thousands
of individual goal-oriented rules. As the student
worked through exercises set by the Tutor, it
estimated the probability that the student had
learned each of the rules and then used this
knowledge to guide the teaching.

The tutoring system can call on the learner
model to adapt its teaching by:

•selecting the form of information to be
presented

•adapting the content of problems and tasks

•changing the content and timing of hints and
feedback (see Jameson 2003 for more

details).

This approach to context awareness is relevant
to MOBIlearn, and we anticipate a use of learner
models within the context-awareness sub-
system.

The underlying assumption behind the use of
learner modelling is that it can make the learning
more effective and learner’s experience more
enjoyable, and this assumption appears to be
borne out by the research (for example Corbett
2001, cited in Jameson 2003).

A further possibility is to mirror an aspect of
the learner model back to the student. The ELM-
ART system from Brusilovsky and colleagues
(Brusilovsky et al. 1996) explored open learner
modelling in which the learner is shown a
visualisation (in the form of a ‘skillometer’ bar
chart) of the system’s model of their current
skills. The learner can reflect on the model and
adapt their learning strategy.

Clearly, there are ethical issues to consider
when gathering detailed information about
users, and this issue is discussed further in
Section 3.

2.4. Context features

The  context- awareness  sub- system
comprises a set of software objects called
context features that respond to features of the
real-world context to provide an ordered list of
recommended options.

Types of context features

Context features are either excluders  or
rankers. Items of content that are deemed
entirely inappropriate for the current context are
excluded. That is to say they are removed from
the  list  of  recommended  content  and  not
subject to any further consideration. Content
remaining in the list after the exclusion process
is then ranked according to how well it matches
the current context. The ranking process simply
increments the score of each item of content
that has metadata matching the stimulus values
of any particular context feature. The size of the
increment depends on the salience value of the
context feature doing the ranking. Individual
context features can have their salience values
changed so that they exert more influence on
the ranking process. Any individual context
feature can be de-activated at any time so that
it has no effect on the exclusion or ranking
processes.

A context feature has a set of possible
values, and an indicator of which value is
currently selected. It is also possible for context
features to have multiple sets of possible
values, with the current active set being
determined by the current value of another
linked context feature.

Linked context features

Each context feature responds to only one
metadata tag and performs either an exclusion
or ranking function. To achieve more complex
filtering of content, context features can be
linked together so that their function (ie their
stimulus and response values, their salience,
and whether they are enabled) can depend on
the  state  of  other  context  features.  For
example, we might choose to have a context
feature that excludes content based on its file-
size – such a context feature should be active if
the  learner  is  using  a  low-bandwidth
connection, but should remain quiescent if a
high bandwidth connection is available. By
creating a context feature that responds to
bandwidth availability and allowing it to control
the status of the context feature that responds
to file-size, we can easily create a pair of
context  features  that  respond  to  a  more
complex  context.  The  linking  process  is



transparent to the user and to individual context
features, so long chains can easily be created to
cope with complex situations.

Output

The ordered list of ranked items of content is
passed  to  delivery  subsystems  for  use  in
determining exactly what content should be
made available to the user. In this way, the
context-awareness sub-system has no way of
specifying exactly what is made available – the
system  is  intended  only  to  make
recommendations to the system and to the user.

2.5. Integration with MOBIlearn system

The overall aim of the MOBIlearn project is to
produce a reference architecture for delivering
learning content to users of mobile devices. The
CAS  represents  an  essential  part  of  that
architecture, but ultimately it depends on other
subsystems to fulfil the goal of providing the
user  with  a  rich  and  effective  learning
experience.  As  the  CAS  is  responsible  for
recommending learning content to be delivered
to users, there are clear interdependencies
between the CAS and the content management
system which is responsible for handling the
content database, accepting recommendations,
and then making appropriate content available
to the user.

The CAS will also have intimate links with an
adaptive  human  interface  (see  Vainio  and
Ahonen 2003), intended to provide a usable,
functional interface on a variety of devices.
Users must be able to inspect, understand and
modify the context model at any time.

Given our aim of providing recommendations
not only about content per se but also relevant
services and options, the CAS will be linked to a
collaborative learning system.

Content delivery itself will be handled mainly
by a learning content management subsystem
that will maintain a repository of available
learning content along with any associated
metadata. The content delivery sub-system and
the CAS will function in tandem to deliver
contextually relevant content to the learner.

3. Ethical issues

Clearly, the gathering of contextual data could
involve the use of information that is personal
and  private  to  the  users  involved.  Such
information needs to be gathered with the
consent of users, and must be stored securely to
prevent misuse by third parties.

There are five main questions to ask when
considering the ethical implications of the use of
contextual data as follow.

1. What information do we obtain?

2. How do we obtain it?

3. What do we use it for?

4. What risks are there in doing this?

5. What do users think about it?

Data being gathered without users being
aware of this is part of our learning solution but
unfortunately also part of the larger problem of
ethical gathering and application of user data.

There are specific international guidelines
and legislations that address concerns about
the gathering and use of such data, and we will
defer to the recommendations set out in such
documents in our use of contextual data.

The following issues are of concern.

•Informed  user  consent: users must be
made aware of what data is being gathered

and what it is being used for, and this
consent should be ongoing in the sense
that users are kept informed for the whole
time they are using the system and have
the  right  to  change  or  withdraw  their
consent at any time. They should also be
made fully aware of the security risks of this
data being gathered, stored and used.

•Control: where consent has been given for
the gathering and use of contextual data,

users should be given information, access,
and control over data.

•Security: it will be necessary to ensure that
any gathered data is stored securely,

available only to necessary parties, and to
prevent the misuse of data by third parties.

Particular  security  problems  arise  when
information is stored on computers other than
the user’s own. We must ensure that as little
information as possible is used, ie only the
essential minimum, and that it is held securely
to be accessible only within the MOBIlearn
system.

Some useful work addressing these issues
has already been described in Rainio (2000)
and the intention within MOBIlearn is to follow
up such work and ensure that we adhere to any
relevant guidelines and legislation.

4. Current status and work in
progress

The CAS is currently implemented as a
prototype demonstrator in Java. The prototype
illustrates  the  operating  principles  of  the
architecture as a stand-alone demonstrator.



The next steps for the MOBIlearn context
awareness sub-system involve linking the CAS
prototype to sensors that can provide real-world
context features on a mobile device such as a
tablet  PC  or  PDA.  As  we  move  towards
integrating  the  CAS  with  the  rest  of  the
MOBIlearn  architecture  we  are  exploring
implementation methods such as web services
architectures (see Booth et al.2003) to achieve
flexible integration of the relevant components.

The CAS prototype will be evaluated as a
stand-alone,  context-aware  application  by
asking  users  to  perform  a  set  of  simple
information retrieval tasks in mobile contexts.
The results of these evaluations will inform the
next phase of our design.

Abstract

Interactive Learning Environments is a course
at Sussex University in which students are given
mobile devices (XDAs) with personal digital
assistant (PDA) functionality and full internet
access for the duration of the term. They are
challenged to design and evaluate learning
experiences, both running and evaluating
learning sessions that involve a blend of
technologies. Data on technology usage is
collected via backups, e-mail and website
logging as well as video and still photography of
student-led sessions. Initial analysis indicates
that  large amounts of technical support, solid
pedagogical  underpinning  and  a  flexible
approach to both delivery context and medium
are essential. The project operated under the
acronym SMILE – Sussex Mobile Interactive
Learning Environment.

Keywords: XDA, pedagogy, conversational
framework

1. Structure of the course

Interactive  Learning  Environments  is  the
latest incarnation of a long-running course, at
the School of Cognitive and Computer Sciences
(COGS), that explores the use of technology in
education. The course is offered to third-year
undergraduate  students  as  well  as  to
postgraduates  from  a  variety  of  master’s
courses.  Because  of  the  speed  at  which
educational technology develops, the course
has to be regularly rewritten and updated.  In

planning the latest version of the course, for
spring term 2003, it was decided that we should
be exploring the learning possibilities offered by
new mobile technologies.

Eighteen mobile devices, XDAs¹ with PDA
functionality and full internet access, were used
as part of the course. Students were allocated
devices for the term and were expected to use
them ‘as their own’. Postgraduate students had
a device each, while the undergraduates had to
share them in small groups of three to four
students. The course itself has a wider remit
than  mobile  technology  alone,  covering
everything  from  the  early  development  of
intelligent tutoring systems to the experimental
tangible and pervasive systems currently being
developed in COGS.² One of the core issues
for the course team was to ground the students’
understanding of educational technology within
an  appropriate  pedagogical  context.
Consequently, the students were introduced to
different  pedagogical  models  that  might
underpin different kinds of ‘learning systems’
and encouraged to use whatever technology
best fitted their purpose. The course team also
provided a website for information along with
access to lecture slides. The website was
particularly well used during a lecture on ‘online
learning’  which  was  delivered  via  the  site
(details below).

Two one-hour lectures a week were used to
cover the syllabus content, while the seminar
time, two hours for postgraduates, one hour for
undergraduates,  was  given  over  to  an
exploration of the issues surrounding the use of



mobile technology for learning. Seminars for
both groups of students consisted of practical
activities using the mobile device, as well as
workshops on topics such as personalisation,
collaboration, design and evaluation. At the start
of the term all the students took part in a data-
gathering exercise, either on campus or in
central Brighton. The exercise was designed as
a familiarisation exercise and to illustrate the
potential  use  of  mobile  devices  within  the
context of Key stage 2 of the UK National
Curriculum, the students acting as designers for
technology to support 10–11-year-old pupils.
Having gathered the required data they then had
to send it back to ‘base’ where it was collated
onto a spreadsheet and displayed on the course
website for viewing with the XDA.

In reflecting on the exercise, students were
expected to consider practical and safety issues,
as well as issues of pedagogy and appropriate
use of the technology.

Towards the end of the term the emphasis for
postgraduates and undergraduates shifted, in
that the postgraduates had to design and run a
‘learning experience’ for the undergraduates
using the devices – the undergraduates then
had to evaluate this session. Formally assessed
work at this point in the course was similarly
focused, with the postgraduates required to
concentrate  on  producing  their  own  design
guidelines for developing interactive learning
environments using mobile devices, while the
undergraduates used multiple data sources,
including video and still photography, for their
evaluation  of  the  session  run  by  the
postgraduates.

2.  Pedagogical grounding for the
course

The pedagogical grounding for the course
itself  derives  from  Diana  Laurillard’s
Conversational Framework (Laurillard 2002).
This approach aims to clarify the mediated
nature of academic learning and to define its
essential  components.  It  identifies  the
component activities of an effective learning
experience, describes them as discursive,
adaptive, interactive or reflective, and stresses
that learning is an iterative dialogue within the
learner and between the learner and others.
This dialogue must operate both at the level of
operations and at the level of conceptions. Both
these levels must be interlinked so that learners
engage with the concepts of the domain to be
learnt about not just with the medium of their

communication. When using digital technology
to support learning, the artefacts in use (XDA,
networked PC, paper) and the operations they
provide  (Powerpoint,  www,  e-mail,  word
processing, etc) are merely dialogue enablers
not   the focus of attention. To maintain a
coherent narrative about the domain being
learnt about – in this case the design of
interactive learning experiences – the course
material was structured in episodes that were
specific to a particular learning goal and not tied
to the technology through which they might be
experienced.

An example will clarify. In week 8 of the 10-
week course the topic was online and distance
learning environments. The goal for the session
was  for  students  ‘to  gain  a  greater
understanding of the challenges facing the
designers of online and/or distance learning
environments’.  This  section  of  the  course
consisted  of  multiple  linked  elements:  a
Powerpoint presentation, an interactive web-
based poll and a discussion forum. Online and
paper-based resources were also identified.
Students were encouraged to log on to the
course website at the normal lecture time
(9.15am on Wednesday morning) and to follow
the  Powerpoint  presentation.  Within  the
presentation students were asked to consider
the key features required for effective face-to-
face learning and likewise for effective online
learning. They were then asked to follow a link
to the interactive polls on the website and vote
for the three features they felt were the most
important in each of these learning contexts. On
returning to the Powerpoint presentation they
were encouraged to reflect on their views and
move on to the online discussion group to share
and discuss their reasoning with the group. The
learning context was, to an extent, within the
control of the individual learner: students could
choose to log on via a computer on campus or
at home. Alternatively all the course elements
could be accessed via the XDA, in which case
students may be in bed, on the bus or in a
coffee bar in town. The material in the course
was designed in accordance with the session
goal. The material was developed in a manner
that allowed it to be accessed across multiple
platforms. The Powerpoint slides were simple,
with audio annotations and no images, so that if
students chose to use their XDA the file could
be downloaded with minimal delay and viewed
easily on the small screen. During the one-hour
lecture session learners were required to be
discursive, adaptive, interactive and reflective
with the support of multiple media and a choice
of technology platform and location. The online
group  forum  remained  a  repository  of  the



discussion, as well as providing storage and
exchange facilities for other student-generated
data.

3. Data collection

Throughout the course a great deal of time
and attention was paid to the issue of data
collection and evaluation. This was extensively
discussed with the students as part of the
process of developing their understanding of
data collection issues. We covered the benefits
and problems associated with different kinds of
data, as well as attendant issues such as
privacy and consent. The following data was
collected:

•university e-mail traffic between course
participants logged from week 4

onwards: when an email was sent
between two or more people involved in
the course we knew whether it was sent
via the XDA or not

•e-mail checks on the COGS server were
logged as coming from either the XDA

or another device

•  access to the course website was
similarly logged as being with the device

or not

•backups of the devices allowed logging

of use of other functions, such as the

calendar

•  complete  record  of  the  e-mail
exchanges via the online group

•data on student attitudes and learning
preferences from a poll taken during the

online session

•  video and still photography from the
postgraduate student-led session

•SMS  data  showing  the  patterns  of
collaboration  during  the  student-led

session

•data  f rom  an  end- of- course
questionnaire about student study

habits, external access to technology
and their attitudes to the XDA (it also
covered preferred input methods and
feelings about the usefulness of the
software and functionality provided)

•  qualitative data from notes taken during
an end-of-course evaluation session

with the postgraduate students.

4. Preliminary data analysis

4.1.What did the students think of the
device?

Attitudes  ranged  from  enthusiastic  to
antagonistic, with most students recognising the
potential  of  the  technology  but  making
statements such as ‘the device isn’t quite there
yet’. Others felt that they had not really had the
opportunity to engage properly with the device,
either because they had to share one: ‘little
incentive to use calendar, etc when you only
have it for three non-consecutive weeks’, or
because handing it back at the end of the
course limited how much data they were willing
to put onto it: ‘it wasn’t m y device so I didn’t
bother putting stuff on it’. Interestingly, very few
students took the opportunity to synchronise the
device with a home PC (the third party software
we purchased for Mac synchronisation has
proved to be problematic).

The large number of different functions were
also considered off-putting by some: ‘you can do
too much stuff on it, who needs all that?’ and ‘our
lives are not complicated enough to require the
use of these devices’. A major issue, which
engendered much discussion, was the size of
the device in relation to the large number of
functions it tries to provide. As one postgraduate
student put it: ‘It’s too small and too big –
carrying it around is a major issue.’ This seemed
to be the case particularly for male students who
were used to being able to carry a small mobile
phone around in a pocket. When used as a
phone the device was generally considered
clumsy and too large, on the other hand the
screen was too small to be used comfortably for
the integrated Office functions (Word and Excel)
or for web browsing ‘a small laptop would make
more sense’. The reliability/trustworthiness of the
device was another issue often raised: some of
the functions were particularly prone to freezing
or crashing, others had problems with GPRS
(web) access and a number of students lost all
data when the battery was not recharged in time.
Other students underused the device because of
concerns about inadvertently exceeding the data
download allowance on the tariff. We purchased
third-party software to monitor data traffic, but
this too proved unreliable. As we were unable to
get figures for use from the airtime service
provider this created a climate of nervousness
among the students; they were concerned about
incurring debt if they used data above the
agreed tariff. Most students tried at least half of
the functions offered by the device (Figure 1),
although e-mail came out a clear winner as its
most useful feature (Figure 2).


4.2.What kind of learning resources
do students value?


Figure 1 Features of the XDA tried by students

Figure 2 The feature considered most useful

Having used the XDA, and explored how it
might be used within an educational context, the
students were asked whether they saw a clear
educational use for the device (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Student views on educational use of the
XDA

4.2.1  The online learning experience in
week 8

Students  were  enthusiastic  about  this
session (described earlier) and joined in during
the  normal  lecture  time  (9.15am  on  a
Wednesday). They accessed the Powerpoint
slides from the website and voted in the polls.
The most popular selections for the three key
features vital to the success of a normal lecture
and  seminar-based,  face-to-face  teaching
experience were:

•  approachable, knowledgeable and
enthusiastic tutors: 25% of the votes

•  fully resourced course website: 13%
of the votes

•  opportunity to take part in group
work: 12% of the votes.

No students felt that interactive media in
lectures  or  state-of-the-art  technology
resources were key features here.

Similarly, the most popular selections for the
three key features vital to the success of a
distance and online course experience were:

•  tutor support online: 24% of the
votes

•web resources: 17% of the votes

•  conference environment and e-mail:
14% of the votes.

In both cases the tutor’s role was seen as
the  key  feature  and  tools  to  support  or
opportunities to take part in, collaborative group
work were seen as important along with web-
based resources. Most (82%) of the students
thought it was harder to design resources for an
online learning experience than for a face-to-
face one. In addition to this, internet access
was viewed as the most important technology
for  both  online  and  face-to-face  teaching
situations. Students want to be connected and
this is one of the key features devices such as
the XDA can offer.

Students  were  engaged  and  willing  to
continue on to the discussion forum where 52
messages were posted. Several students also
took advantage of the chat room, though there
is no record of this discussion. A content
analysis  of  the  messages  posted  to  the
discussion  forum  reveals  that  the  largest
category of talk was about the technology and
its operation. However, there were also large
amounts of discussion about the key features
for  learning  in  distance  and  face-to-face



contexts. Examples from the different types of
talk included the following.

• Context/process

Mmmm  waking up almost an hour later

than usual, looking at the slides while still
in bed and listening to the audio over
breakfast. Am now planning on taking the
bus and continuing the lecture with my
XDA  how nice

• Operational/technology

I'm battling with a UNIX terminal, not good
for media, to (sic) slow.

•  Key features of a VLE/F2F the ‘Asker’
polling system

Well, I have answered the first set of
questions and here are (sic) what I said
and why:

Enthusiastic  tutors,  interesting  and
accessible books, and up-to date content.
I think these are the most important
characteristics for a face-to-face course.

Figure 4 illustrates the content breakdown
within the discussion forum.

4.3.E-mail and web-logging data

This data is still in the process of being
analysed, but the preliminary findings show
some interesting usage patterns. The e-mail
logging only began in week 4 of the course.
This was due to extensive discussions held with
the students about issues of privacy regarding
their use of e-mail and who they were mailing.
The decision was made to only log e-mail traffic
between course participants, not content, nor
e-mails sent to individuals outside the course.
Not surprisingly, the course admin. team came
out ahead in the average number of e-mails
sent to course members, both using the device
and not using it. The postgraduates were more
frequent users of the device overall for e-mail,
but the undergraduates were at the severe
disadvantage of sharing devices so not being
able to use it to access their personal e-mail.
E-mail traffic from the undergraduate device
came from a group alias set up for the course,
therefore we need to consider carefully how this
data might be used for comparative purposes.
Access to the course website, on the other
hand, did not have the same kind of restrictions
(Figures  5  and  6).  The  overall  ratio³  of
postgraduate to undergraduate use of the XDA
for accessing the course website is 1:0.7,
whereas for access to the website using other
devices it is 1:1.5. Overall the undergraduates
used the course website more when not using
the XDA.


Figure 4 Discussion forum messages (repeated
text and header information excluded)

Figure 5 Average website access per XDA device

Figure 6 Average website access per user (not
using the XDA)

There are interesting weekly fluctuations in
all the data; these will be examined in the light



of  different  course  requirements  for  the
undergraduate and postgraduate groups during
those periods. Hourly patterns of use are also
interesting, showing that students are active and
online even in the early hours of the morning
(Figure 7).

Figure 7 Hourly patterns of use with the XDA
device

Data gathered from backing up the device
was, unfortunately, patchy. Students did not
always bring in the device at the required time;
others forgot to recharge the battery, resulting in
loss of data for that period.

of phone calls and a 20Mb download limit,
students were then to pay any excess usage.
Although this turned out to be a generous limit
overall, the lack of adequate software for
logging  data  use  made  some  students
overcautious, in that they did not use the device
very much in case they incurred charges. This
over caution represented the extreme end of a
pleasingly responsible use of the devices by the
students; none of the devices were damaged or
lost, although one SIM card went missing when
a student removed it in a shop to try it in
another device.

Initial  results  on  the  use  of  mobile
technology, such as those reported in Mlearn
2001, 2002 and in the 2002 IEEE workshop
(Milrad et al. 2002) have been encouraging.
Researchers have suggested, for example, that
mobile learning enhances autonomous and
collaborative  learning  (Cereijo  Roibás  and
Arnedillo Sánchez 2002), and that it can be
applied to a wide age range of students (Inkpen
2000; Perlin and Fox 1993; Sharples et al. 2002
and Soloway et al. 2001).


5. Preliminary conclusions

The overall feeling from both the course team
and the students was that this was a worthwhile
exercise, allowing an investigation of the use of
such devices within an educational context. In
particular,  it  allowed  students  who  were
interested in becoming developers of such
technology the opportunity to explore not only
design and usability issues, but also the pitfalls
encountered in the ‘real life’ use of them. From
the perspective of the course team a number of
valuable lessons were learnt, the most important
being that once you add the feature of ‘online
connectivity’ to a device the administrative
burden increases dramatically. Particularly
onerous was the task of dealing with the
company responsible for airtime billing, trying to
negotiate sensible tariffs at the start of the
project, finding out usage information during it
(not possible!) and then renegotiating tariffs
when we found we would have been better off
on a different scheme.

An enormous amount of time was spent
maintaining the devices in full working order. As
was mentioned above there were numerous
problems with the devices – in particular GPRS
access, installing third-party software, resolving
problems with that software when it turned out to
be buggy and, finally, negotiating the thorny
issue of tariffs and billing. As the devices had
been given to the students to use ‘as their own’
there was the issue of who paid the bills. The
project paid the basic tariff for a limited number

The evaluation of this learning experience, in
particular the contribution of the technology, is
ongoing. However, the initial analysis discussed
here  would  suggest  that  the  provision  of
coherent learning opportunities and episodes
mediated by technology and accessible through
multiple devices is possible. Students engaged
well  with  the  week  8  session  on  distance
learning. They used the XDA and/or a desktop
machine  to  interact  with  the  Powerpoint
presentation; they voted using the website
‘asker’ and could watch as their peers did
likewise and the representation of this data
adapted  accordingly.  They  joined  in  the
discussion and reflected upon their differing
views. Indeed the discussion continued long
after the allocated session had finished.

Other  emerging  positive  findings  are
illustrated  by  the  use  of  the  device  for
accessing and interacting with information: the
course website, and for course-based e-mail
exchanges. The students who had sole use of
an XDA used it for both types of activity,
throughout the day and most of the night. The
device enabled them to experience the promise
of anywhere, anytime connectivity with learning
resources both human and electronic. The
technology can certainly support the iterative
dialogue we know must take place for learning
to be effective. However, this is not universally
the case, with students reticent about using the
device and failing to engage with much of its
functionality. To be successful, designers of



interactive learning experiences that involve this
type of mobile connectivity need to provide:

•a strong focus for the activity to engage
learners with the concepts of the domain

to  be  learnt  about,  with  regular
reminders throughout the interaction

•activities that require a clear and simple
use of a very limited set of the functions

available through the technology

•regular support from peers and teachers
both face to face and online.

They also need to be able to access a vast
amount of technical support both before and
during the course being offered.

Abstract

The aim of this paper is to explore the
possibilities of Java midlets (small applications
that can be stored in a mobile phone) as
learning  tools  in  higher education,  via an
experience we are developing for the actuarial
degree of Málaga University.

Keywords: midlets, mobile learning, higher

education.

1. Introduction

Mobile phone devices are becoming very
popular within the communities of university
students in Spain, as  well as in nearby
countries. As they are mainly used for social
purposes, far less attention has been given to
their use as learning tools. A previous paper,
Mayorga-Toledano  (2002), studied the
possibilities of integrating the use of interactive
tests designed for  WAP phones into higher
education  (HE) strategies.  In this paper  we
explore the educative use of Java midlets for
two courses in the actuarial degree of Málaga
University.

2. Previous research

or business). These students do not take all the
scheduled courses for the academic year and
do not attend classes regularly. Based on our
experience of running this course, we decided
to investigate new channels to communicate
with our students and to deliver learning
content.

Nowadays, the interactions between teacher
and students take place mainly in the
classroom and on the internet via the virtual
campus  of the University of Málaga. However,
the widespread use of mobile phones among
our students has led us to consider how this
technology might help us to improve the
motivation  of and communication with our
students.

Figure 1. Mobiles used by students



The first step we took was to carry out a brief
survey among the 112 students of the first
course to understand their attitudes to, and
knowledge of, mobile technologies.

Figure 1 shows the main results of the first
part of the questionnaire. It was found that all
the respondents had a mobile telephone: 47% of
the phones had WAP capabilities, and 18%
were Java enabled. However, none of the
respondents declared that they used WAP or
Java. Also, only 6% of the students had PDAs,
and no one reported a regular use of this kind of
mobile device.

These results indicate that the dominant
mobile device among our students is the mobile
phone. Although their phones are not currently
equipped with the latest technologies, 77% of
the students declared they will buy a new mobile
phone within the next two years, and it is likely
that many of these new devices will come with
WAP and Java.

Figure 2. Opinions about educative tools for the
mobile phone

The second part of the questionnaire focused
on the attitudes of the students towards different
kinds of educative tools designed specifically for
the mobile phone.

The results of this part are summarised in
Figure 2. In general terms, the majority showed
a good response to the five tools noted in the
questionnaire.  The  tool  with  the  highest
percentage of ‘very useful’ responses was the
‘test’ (at 47%), and the one with the lowest was
the micromodule (at 12%). A micromodule is a
small independent application, related to a
theoretical  or  practical  concept,  that
complements the non-virtual teaching, like a
collection  of  mini-charts  showing  the  legal
hierarchy in the banking market or a program
that calculates probabilities and critical values of
a normal model. The findings obtained from the
survey  were  the  main  incentive  for  the

development of learning tools for mobile phone
devices in our actuarial degree courses. In a
previous  study,  Mayorga-Toledano  (2002)
developed WAP interactive tests for students of
tourism at the University of Málaga. The results
were  unsatisfactory,  because  the  students
found WAP connections very expensive and did
not  take  the  tests  regularly.  Now  we  are
developing educative tools based on the Java
platform to avoid those main drawbacks.

3.  An educative application of Java
midlets in higher education

Java technologies for mobile phones are
opening  up  new  opportunities  for  the
development of educative applications in the
field of mobile learning. Java midlets are small
applications that can be stored in the mobile
phone and they have two important advantages
compared with WAP applications, which we
explore in an earlier paper. First, once the
midlet is stored, it can be used offline, without
connection costs. Second, the popularity of
Java games makes this technology very familiar
to the students. The former can alleviate the
problems noticed by Cher Ping and Chwee
Beng (2002) and Loh (2000) in using mobile
devices  for  m-learning  through  the  WAP
protocol.

We are developing educative midlets for two
courses in the actuarial degree of Málaga
University: Banking, Insurance and Securities
Market Law (BISML), and Actuarial Statistics
(AcStat), both courses being held in the first
semester of the first year. Our goal is to make
the midlets available by the beginning of the
2003/04 academic year.

The midlets are integrated into a blended
learning strategy that includes virtual (web-
based activities and midlets) and non-virtual
elements. The rationale behind this strategy is
trying to ensure that every student can access
contents independently of the channel he or
she chooses to use.

The  midlets  we  are  developing  are
deliberately simple and lightweight. They share
a similar structure and interface, but their
contents are specific to the two courses.

Ring’s 2001 study about e-learning that
combines web and mobile devices states that
mobile  devices  are  best  used  to  support
particular  aspects  of  learning,  like  alerts,
reminders, multiple-choice tests, or glossaries.
The contents of our midlets are very similar to
the ones mentioned in that study.


have been designed specifically for the mobile
phones,  so  their  main  features  are  the
following:

•reduced number of questions in every
test

•questions and answers expressed in
deliberately  simple,  although  strictly

correct, language

•answers easily selected with the phone
keys

•  immediate feedback – the user knows in
real time if their choice is correct.


Figure 3. Main screen of the midlet

The midlet for the Law course includes a
calendar, a glossary, and interactive tests (see
Figure 3). The first module, the calendar, is
essentially informative, while the other two, the
glossary and the tests, are actually learning
tools.

The AcStat midlet has the same modules as
the law midlet, but also includes a list of the
main  mathematical  functions  used  in  the
course, classified by lessons (see Figure 6).

The  calendar  module  includes  useful
information such as the dates of exams, the
internet address of the course for additional
online resources, calendar of classes, and so on

4. Conclusions

There has never been a technology that has
penetrated the world with the depth and speed
of  mobile  telephony.  The  challenge  for
universities  now  is  to  develop  didactic
environments and tools for mobile devices and
to integrate them into their learning strategies.
For this reason it is important to develop and
experiment with adequate tools to investigate
their benefits and effectiveness. As educators,
we  need  to  be  open  to  new  teaching
instruments and new ways of learning. In doing
so, we are setting a good example to our
students.

Despite the limited possibilities of Java-
enabled mobile phones, it is possible to design
learning tools for this environment, like the ones
proposed in this paper (mainly the interactive
tests), which complement the integral process
of learning. Students showed interest in them in
a previous survey and we expect that this will
continue when the tools become available,
although this aspect deserves further research.
In addition, if the tools proposed in this research
reach a minimum level of use, we plan to


develop  more  tools  like  a  mini-lab  for
experimenting  with  the  main  mathematical
models of Actuarial Statistics in the AcStat
midlet.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that we believe
in a flexible learning strategy. That is, all our
didactic resources must be available in several
types of media, to allow students access
according to their own preferences, attitudes
and requirements. This implies that the tests and
other contents presented here will be also
available via the internet, and in the campus
laboratories.

Abstract

This paper draws on preliminary findings from
a pilot study of a sixth-grade class at a
University of Michigan–Hi-CE¹ project school.
The study gives indications of what can be
achieved with handheld technology in education

– a transition from disruptive technology to
useful and enhancing educational technology. It
focuses on the school arena because this has
been the focus of much debate with regard to
educational technology. This paper discusses
the role of mobile and handheld technologies in
education, exploring in which arenas handhelds
are being used, and how and why are they used.
This  leads  to  the  question:  are  handheld
technologies changing classroom culture?

Keywords: handhelds, learning culture,
integral to daily learning, disruptive technology

1.  The  possibilities  of  mobile
learning

Mobile and handheld computers offer new
possibilities in education. Computer technology
has been criticised for being segregated from
the ongoing aspects of children’s lives, being
relegated to the ‘computer rooms’ in schools,
and making the use of personal computers
(PCs) anything but personal (Soloway et al.
2001). It has been suggested that access on its

own will not fulfil the promise many believe lies
in the use of information and communications
technology (ICT) in schools (Bransford et al.
2000). However, this paper is based on the
premise  that  flexible  access  to  handheld
technology will provide the tools to help children
construct knowledge throughout their daily
activities, making such technology an integral
part of daily learning (Soloway et al. 2001).

2.  Mobile learning technologies
in education

Many writers have developed scenarios
describing the use of handheld technology both
inside and outside the classroom, and the
difference between learning inside and outside
school has often been addressed (Lave and
Wenger 1991; Resnick 1987). Learning has
been described as being ‘locked’ in the schools’
formal setting (Somekh 2002).

The National Council of Research report
How people learn (Bransford et al. 2000)
emphasises that bringing students and teachers
in  contact with the broader community can
enhance their learning, while the OECD report
Learning to change: ICT in schools (2001)
illustrates that ICT has established a new
complementarity between formal learning in
school    and informal learning outside.

Miettinen (1999) has pointed out that school
learning is characterised by the memorisation
and reproduction of school texts in which



teacher talk dominates, and students’ activity is
largely  limited  to  answering  questions
formulated  by  the  teacher.  This  raises  the
question as to what kind of learning culture is
predominant in the school or specific classroom.
In this case culture refers to the way things are
done in a particular setting, ie the social process
and context. In such a learning culture as
Miettinen describes, drawing on examples of
mobile  telephony  in  classrooms,  handheld
devices can be regarded as ‘intruders’ in the
learning culture, a disturbance (Mifsud 2002),
and therefore a disruptive technology. The term
‘disruptive technology’ has mainly been used in
organisational  theories.  Christensen  (1997)
noted: ‘Disruptive technologies … are usually
simpler and cheaper … offer less capability …
they are usually shunned by well-managed
companies – which are often later destroyed by
[the disruptive technologies].’

While  handhelds  can  be  described  as
cheaper,  and  offering  less  capability,  this
definition does not entirely fit the picture of
school.  However,  the  term  ‘disruption’  as
‘interrupting the flow or continuity’ (see The
Concise Oxford Dictionary 1990) does seem to
apply.

Sharples  (undated)  points  out  that  the
assumption that ‘computer-mediated learning
will occur in the classroom, managed by a
teacher’ is now being challenged by the growth
in  access  to  personal  technologies. Many
children already have access to a wide range of
computing and communications devices.  As
well as the examples of mobile telephony in
classrooms  (Mifsud  2002), Mifsud  (2003)
suggests  that  the  new  types  of  mobile
telephones  and  personal  digital  assistants
(PDAs) offering extra functions, such as voice
and  image  recording,  can  also  act  as  a
disruptive technology.

Disruption or disruptive technologies can also
be associated with control. Sharples (undated)
suggests that handhelds may become ‘a zone of
conflict’ between teachers and learners, with
both trying to get control of the opportunities it
affords for managing and monitoring learning.
He further points out that this potential for
confrontation  needs  to  be  recognised  and
addressed. Mifsud (2002) addresses the same
topic, referring to personal experience of the
classroom  culture,  where  for  example
communication  is  mainly  ‘controlled’  by  the
teacher and punctuated by raised hands from
students wishing to contribute to a school or
classroom-related discussion. In this setting,
other forms of communication, between friends
or classmate, for example, are not legitimate.

Some teachers have also expressed worries
at the implementation of PDAs in their

classrooms and learning culture because they
might be used for things other than school-
related work, such as playing games, pranks, e-
mailing friends in and out of school or cheating
on tests (Trotter 2001). These worries are also
reflected in the final Palm Education Pioneers’
Report (Vahey et al. 2002), where inappropriate
use of handhelds is one of the drawbacks:
‘games  are  played  during  class  time,
downloading  inappropriate  materials  and
inappropriate  use  of  beaming  (for  passing
notes,  cheating  on  tests  and  ‘copying’  by
handing in assignments beamed from other
students)’. These ‘worries’ can also be related
to Sharples’  zone  of  conflict  over  control
(Sharples undated).

3. From scenario to reality?

3.1. The ‘learning in the palm of your
hand’ project

Hi-CE,² the Center for Highly Interactive
Computing in Education at the University of
Michigan, is currently working with schools in
Michigan to integrate Palm handheld computers
into  classrooms.  In  this  project  they  are
investigating two models of student use of Palm
handhelds: the ‘personal computer’ model,
where  each  student  is  assigned  a Palm
computer to take home; and the ‘class set’
model, where there is a class set of Palms that
teachers use for specific curricular activities. Hi-
CE is currently working with the third, sixth,
eighth and ninth grades (ie students aged
between 7 and 14).

This  paper  focuses  on  a  pilot  project
involving  sixth-grade  classes  using  the
‘personal computer’ model.

Hi-CE is also developing and researching a
collection of applications for the classroom –
‘the Cool Dozen’ – based on the Palm operating
system (OS), along with instructions for each.
One of these is PiCoMap, a concept-mapping
program. Students working on a topic can first
work on their own, making their own concept
map. The concept map can then be beamed
(sent through an infra-red port) to another PDA.
The programs also include an offline browser
(FlingIt)³; a scrapbook maker (Go ‘n tell) that
can be used with a camera to create a story
illustrated with pictures; FreeWrite, a word-
processing program; Sketchy, an animation tool
featuring geometric objects; many pen options,
and an ‘easy-to-use’ interface.

3.2. The pilot study

The aim of the pilot study was to find out in
which arenas handhelds are used, how and
why they are used and what role they can play.
As Inkpen (1999) points out, referring to the



entertainment world of Nintendo and Game Boy,
handheld computer technology for children is not
a new idea.

The 24 pupils in this pilot study are 12-year-
old sixth graders at an Intermediate School in
Michigan, USA. The school is a consolidated
school, meaning that some of the pupils have a
long journey to school – sometimes as much as
an hour.

The class is a Hi-CE project class. The
teacher has been a Jason project⁴ teacher for
nine years. She had received information about
the Hi-CE project and initiated contact with
them.  She  has  been  using  handhelds  in
teaching for three years. The students used the
Palm III handheld computer and had started
using their handhelds at the beginning of the
school year in September 2002. They could take
their handhelds home if they want to. The
teacher reported that she has had excellent
technical help from the Hi-CE team.

3.3. Methodology

Classroom  observations  and  informal
interviews  with  pupils  and  teachers  were
undertaken. The first design of the pilot study
opened up for observation not only ‘inside’ the
classroom but also ‘outside’ – in the canteen,
library and school-yard. Jensen (2002) defines
observation as referring to ‘…a set of research
activities that involve the continuous and long-
term presence, normally of one researcher, and
generally in one delimited locale…’. The canteen
and the school-yard proved however difficult to
put into practice as following the students very
closely in their free time means disturbing their
natural behaviour and is also quite intrusive.
Catching what the students are talking about
also proved to be difficult in these arenas. To
compensate for this, the students were asked to
draw a concept map depicting where, for what
and why they used their handheld computer
(see an example in Figure 1). Concept mapping
was used as a means of expressing ideas
quickly, and providing evidence from each of the
pupils.  According  to  the  ImpaCT2⁵  study,
concept maps ‘consist of putting words that
represent concepts in boxes and linking these
by means of words or phrases, so that the
connections can be read’. The study refers to
Novak and Gowin’s 1984 work, where they
found that this approach gave researchers more
accurate  insights  into  pupils’  thinking  than
traditional methods of testing, or a mind map.

After  two  weeks  of  observation,  some
students were interviewed. Two different forms
of  interview  were  used  –  group  or  focus
interviews and the more traditional one-to-one
interviews. The lessons observed were taken as
the starting point of the interview. One of the

interviewees was chosen because he appeared
to be tapping away at his handheld most of the
time; the rest of the group was randomly
selected.⁶ This was done to try to determine
what would be most appropriate in the final
study.

The interviews in the pilot study were semi-
structured.⁷ The first interview was recorded on
a  mini-disc,  but  during  the  interview  the
students supported what they were saying by
referring to their handheld, so it seemed that it
would be more fruitful to film the interviews. As
a result, the information saved on the students’
handhelds was also recorded.

3.4. Findings and discussion

3.4.1 Arenas of use

All the pupils in the study indicated that they
used the handheld in arenas other than school,
such as home and in the car, with most using
games.  These games were used in situations
that the pupils described as potentially ‘boring’,
or when they did not ‘have anything to do’.
Students also reported using their handhelds on
their  way  to  school,  both  for  finishing
assignments and for games, especially where
the students lived far away from the school. The
Palm  Education  Pioneers  Report  also
concludes that handheld technology can be
used in different contexts and in more places
than in the classroom. (Vahey et al. 2002). As
Inkpen (1999) points out, one of the main
advantages of handheld devices is their ease of
integration into a child’s world – the products
themselves become a part of the children’s
culture.

The concept maps also suggest that the
students had a clear understanding of which
functions were used, for what purpose and in
which  context.  Examples  of  this  include
concept-mapping, offline browsing and word-
processing in the school arena, the address
book at home, and games at home, at school
and in the car.

3.4.2. In the classroom arena

In the classroom it was observed that the
students appeared to work mainly in groups of
four. The teacher and the students had agreed
on a set of rules for use of the handheld, which
specifically included the games. The students
were allowed to play games on their handhelds
as long as they had finished the task set, and
most of the students were observed playing
games towards the end of the lesson. The
students appeared to move freely from one
group  to  the  other  exchanging  information
(sometimes  it  appeared  that  they  also
exchanged games or the results of games⁸). The
program  PicChat  also  allows  immediate
communication between the students (through
the infra-red port), which the teacher has ‘no
control over’. However there did not appear to
be any conflicts over the zone of control. In fact,
the teacher herself commented that she had to
‘eventually let go of some of the control’.

The Palm Education Pioneer’s Report (Vahey
et al. 2002) suggests that ‘it is important that
teachers find time to research available software
and peripherals and … take time to learn how to
use them as well as how to integrate the
handheld, software and peripherals into their
learning activities [emphasis added]’. Yet time is
a commodity which is hard to come by for any
teacher. The teacher in the project pointed out
that she did not ‘fully integrate’ the use of the
handheld until she became more familiar with
the many ways to use the Palm ‘it just sort of
came natural as I became more knowledgeable'.

Observations at the Hi-CE project school
suggest that the handheld computers were an
integral part of the daily flow of school and
classroom activities. That is, they were used as
and when needed and in context; and also
refers to seamlessness – without disruption in
the flow of activities. The teacher did not always

ask the students to use the handhelds, although
she did sometimes make suggestions about
what programs could be used. It was up to the
students to find what they deemed to be the
best way of achieving the task at hand, whether
this meant using word-processing, animation
tools, concept maps or role-play. This appears
to be supported by findings from the Palm
Education Pioneers’ Report (Vahey et al. 2002)
where the teachers also indicated that handheld
computers were more easily integrated with the
flow  of  learning  activities  than  desktop
computers.

The OECD report (2001) points out that ‘in a
world with easy access to huge stores of
information, the skills of accessing ... are more
important than the ability to recall in detail ever
greater  amounts  across  many  fields  of
knowledge’. In one of the lessons observed, the
students were working on a project on medieval
castles. They were also building castles from
old milk cartons, aluminium foil and paint. The
desktop PC was used for online browsing, with
the information that the students found relevant
downloaded to their handheld using an offline
browser called ‘FlingIt’. Their handheld does not
have  unlimited  memory,  in  this  case  the
memory was 8MB, so the students had to be
selective in what they chose to download and
establish a set of criteria for making their
choices.  While  it  is  too  early  to  draw
conclusions, there did seem to be an indication
that the students learn to pick and choose the
websites they need, and assess their relevance
to the task at hand. The teacher did suggest in
the beginning that websites ‘flung’⁹ from the
Internet to the handhelds are limited to two links
and a few pictures, but it is ultimately the
student who decides what is relevant for the
task at hand. During one particular lesson,
some of the students decided that they needed
a depth of three links as well as pictures of
castles but the observations of the information
‘flung’ show that the students do generally limit
the number of links and download pictures
sparingly.

4. Reflections

The  use  of  handheld  technology  in
education is at a beginning phase, with more
than a decade of research of desktop ICT
behind it. Soloway et al. (2001) stated that we
can now try to learn from the past mistakes of
ICT implementation in schools. Several new
questions are also raised as a result, including:

•  Does the transition from disruptive to
‘non-disruptive’ technology require

familiarisation with the technology? Is
‘letting go of some control’ indicative of



a change in the learning culture? Does
the ‘zone of conflict over control’ have to
disappear?

•Is the teacher who chooses to use
handhelds in the classroom contributing

to the flow of activities in the classroom
and thus seeking to change the learning
culture? (The use of handhelds in this
project  was  not  imposed  by
management.)

The  research  discussed  in  this  paper
indicates  that  handhelds  can  be  a  useful,
enhancing rather than disruptive technology and
an integral part of school, and life.

One of the first challenges is to view the
technology  as  a  bridge  between  different
learning arenas, and for teachers to take time to
find out how to integrate it into their learning
activities. When access is no longer a problem,
the challenge lies in using mobile technologies
well, both as an enhancer in the classroom and

to bridge arenas that are usually referred to as
separate – such as school and free time.

Exploring the potential of a games-oriented implementation
for m-portal

Abstract

The  m-learning  project  is  a  3-year  pan-
European project, supported by the European
Commission's Information Society Technologies
(IST) programme within the Fifth Framework. It
is  investigating  how  the  use  of  mobile
technologies might address the literacy and
numeracy skills needs of young adults aged
16–24 who are outside formal learning settings,
start to change their attitudes towards learning
and contribute towards their life chances. M-
portal is Ultralab’s contribution to the m-learning
project. It forms the interface layer to the m-
learning system, a virtual tutor and skills-based
learning materials. Our aim is a user-friendly
portal layer that is engaging and empowering,
and will attract young people to learning.

As part of our research activity, we have
undertaken a literature review of the use of
computer  and  video  games  for  learning,
including learners’ experiences with educational
computer games and associated design issues.
We  have  also  undertaken  associated  field
research with target audiences. The research
findings are reported here and appear to support
our view of the motivating potential and possible
learning  gains  of  games  played  on  mobile
devices with target audiences.   The findings
lead to recommendations that may be of interest
to prospective software developers in the design
of computer games, including games used on
mobile devices, which can engage young adults
in learning. In the light of the investigation the
paper concludes that a games-oriented m-portal
interface developed with such engagement in
mind could have potential for encouraging a
learning culture among target audiences. Some
key challenges involved in seeking to implement
the idea are highlighted.

Keywords: computer games, video games,
mobile games, multi-user role-play games, m-
portal, learning potential

1.   Background and rationale

Ultralab, a learning technology research
centre based at Anglia Polytechnic University
(APU), is developing a learning interface for
mobile  devices  (m-portal).  This  is  our
contribution to the m-learning project, a 3-year
pan-European  project  supported  by  the
European  Commission  under  the  IST
Programme, Fifth Framework. Coordinated by
the   UK’s Learning and Skills Development
Agency (LSDA), the m-learning project seeks to
address some pressing socio-educational
problems relating to many young Europeans in
the age range 16–24. These are: poor literacy
and  numeracy  and  non-participation  in
conventional education, leading to possible
unemployment and social exclusion (OECD
2000). Many of these target audiences lack
access to a computer, but do regularly use a
mobile phone. Thus, the m-learning project is
using readily available mobile technologies that
many young adults find useful and attractive to
attempt to re-engage them with learning.

Our aim is to produce a user-friendly m-
portal that is powerful and empowering, and
encourages active participation by its users. To
address these challenges, and to ensure that
m-portal is needs-driven in the sense that it
meets the needs of the young adults, we
undertook an iterative programme of research
and  development.  This  includes  games-
oriented field research engaging co-researchers
from the target audience, complemented by a
review of the literature relating to computer and
video games.

This paper reports a selection of findings
from the literature review and the games-
oriented field research. It draws conclusions
and makes recommendations that may be of
interest to prospective software developers.

The terms ‘games’ and ‘computer games’
are used inclusively to denote all kinds of
interactive computer games, regardless of



hardware platform. ‘Playing’ and ‘gaming’ are
used to denote the playing of computer games
in general; ‘gaming’ also denotes the playing of
online games.

2.   The literature review: summary
findings and recommendations

2.1  Review limitations and focus

As a joint initiative, LSDA undertook an
intensive search of the literature about the use
of computer and video games for learning, and
Ultralab reviewed the resulting material. The full
report on the use of computer and video games
for learning will be published by LSDA later in
2004. These summary extracts focus on the:

•use of computer games to encourage
learning

•  users’ experiences of educational games:
two studies

•designing ‘edugames’ (educational games).

In reviewing the literature, a number of
limitations  were  found,  including  perceived
inadequacies  in  research  design  and
methodology, short-term focus and the use of
non-random sample populations (Randel et al.
1992; Berson 1996; Dempsey et al. 1994; Harris
2001).  Thus,  assertions  resulting  from  this
review are open to debate.

2.2   Using  computer  games  to
encourage learning

A  growing  number  of  researchers  and
theorists (Dempsey et al. 1994; Doolittle 1995;
Griffiths 1996; de Lisi and Cammarano 1996;
Emes 1997; Mumtaz 2001; de Lisi and Wolford
2002; Kirriemur 2002; Ko  2002;  Pillay 2003)
ascribe significant benefits to use of computer
games in educational settings. They have been
found to:

•  act as ice-breakers and rapport-builders
(Spence 1988; Gardner 1991; Lynch 1981

and 1983; Phillips 1991; all cited by Griffiths
1996)

•  stimulate curiosity, discovery learning and
perseverance (Ehman and Glenn 1991 cited

by Berson 1996; Ko 2002; Kirriemur 2002)

•  enable risk-free experimentation (Berson
1996)

•promote  spatial  learning  and  cognitive
processing (McClurg and Chaille 1987)

•  provide motivation via immediate feedback
(Roubidoux et al. 2002)

•  enhance self-esteem and confidence
(Ritchie and Dodge 1992)

•  support  cognitive  apprenticeship
(Greenfield et al. 1996) especially where

users have control over the tools (Small
and Samijo 1997).

Prensky (2001) emphasises the importance
of a user-relevant context and recommends
selective use of games styles geared to both
content and learning activities. Other authors
concur with this view including Brownfield and
Vik 1983; Randel et al. 1992; Griffiths 1996).

Studies  conducted  by  the  British
Educational Communications and Technology
Agency (Becta) offer the following ideas for
incorporating computer games into learning
environments (Kirriemur 2002):

•multi-user online games used in class and
linked to formal homework or an informal

fun activity could enable students to access
and exchange data with classmates or
students elsewhere and then e-mail their
work back to the teacher

•  multi-user  online  games  used  with
networked library services could encourage

collaborative research activity (although
research was advocated to test whether
this was feasible).

2.3   Users’ learning experiences of
educational games: two studies

Leddo’s  (1996)  study  specifically
investigated  learners’  experiences  of
educational games. It was found that learners
preferred games to standard classroom
instruction, but – and this is a big but – students
‘would never voluntarily play such a game
outside of class’. Essentially such games were
disliked where the fun element was missing.

Issues  of  race  and  gender  were
spontaneously raised. Females complained that
commercial  games  were  male-oriented.  A
balance of both gender and ethnicity were
requested. Proposed solutions included ‘to
have the game played from the perspective of
the main game character’s eyes’ or to enable
user choice via a character editor, a tool that
allows modification of the character: gender,
ethnicity, and so on.

Variety  in  the  context,  mission  and
complexity  was  also  requested  in  Leddo’s
study. Students wanted novelty, surprise and
humour, with little break in action – instruction
should  flow  with  the  game.  Performance



feedback was very important (Betz 1995; Berson
1 9 9 6). They also wanted the game to be
challenging and to become more difficult with
improved mastery of the game. Graphics and
special effects were liked and virtually all
students, male and female, wanted some sort of
combat or shooting in the game. This is contrary
to other findings (Dempsey et al. 2002) that
females are put off by aggressive distracters (ie
violent characters and incidents), but is in line
with Chappell’s (1997) view that this may be a
faulty over-generalisation.

Dempsey et al.’s (2002) study with adult
respondents advocated the use of simulation,
adventure,  arcade,  board,  puzzle  and  word
games  for  promoting  problem-solving  and
decision-making skills, linked to specific topics.
This  study  found  that  respondents  wanted
games with clear, concise instructions that were
challenging and game-oriented. Player control
over speed, level of difficulty, timing, sound
effects and feedback were also desired, together
with  high-quality  functionality  to  sustain
engagement and game structure that was not
too complex for different players’ ability levels.

2.4  Designing ‘edugames’

Fabricatore (2000) suggests that learning
gains associated with gaming should be
exploited when designing educational games.
He suggests that producers of ‘edutainment’
software (ie software that engages a person’s
interest as well as being educational) often seek
to make the game subservient to the educational
process: where the resulting products do not
incorporate some form of opposition, they lack
cohesion between game and cognitive task and
are not true games. According to Fabricatore,
active participation, challenge and the role of
struggle are the key concepts (see Randel et al.
1992). Thus, what are needed, Fabricatore says
(2000, page 15), are new paradigms in
educational game design:

A good approach to create better educational
games  is  not  thinking  what  gaming
experience can be the most motivating frame
for some controlled learning activities, but
rather how to create a virtual environment
and a gaming experience in which the
contents that we want to teach can be
naturally embedded with some contextual
relevance in terms of the game playing …
learning tasks must be contextual to the
game in the sense that they must be
perceived by the player as a true element of
the game play.

Referring to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros, a
leisure game where bricks scattered through
every scenario are integral to game play and
enhance the fun, Fabricatore (2000, page 15)
suggests that these: ‘could be hiding anything
else, for instance letters or numbers, and they
would still be perceived as part of the game-
play.’

For proof, he designed and produced six
Game-Boy games. He reports these were
successfully tested in classrooms with around

300  children  aged  between  six  and  eight,
supervised by their teachers. The supervisors
acknowledged  unintentional  as  well  as
intentional learning gains and also: ‘general
improvements  in  terms  of  discipline,
concentration and eagerness to understand
technological issues related to the games they
were playing’.

Fabricatore calls this alternative design
approach: ‘edugaming’, where there is: ‘no
unnatural  barrier  separating  learning  from
gaming’.

In similar vein, Prensky (2001, page 179)
advocates that learning games should (in this
order):

•Be fun enough to engage those other than
target audiences.

•Allow users to consider themselves
‘players’ as opposed to ‘students’ or

‘trainees’.

•Be an ‘addictive’ experience, producing
‘word of mouth’ among users.

•Enable users’ skills in the learning content

of the game to improve rapidly and

significantly the more they play.

•Encourage reflection on what has been
learned.

This last point is important because reflection is
seen as a ‘disappearing skill’ in terms of the
users. Prensky further recommends providing a
non-game  option  for  those  who  are  not
engaged by the electronic learning game in
order to cater for different learner preferences.

Finally, it is useful to note that Dempsey et
al. (1994, pages 5–6) draw together other
writers’ recommendations for the designers of
educational computer games.

•  Intrinsically motivating games (the game
structure itself promotes learning) are

preferable to extrinsically motivating
games, (real or imaginary rewards are
given).



•Pay attention to gender preferences.

•Incorporate debriefing into game activities.

•Vary the methods of scoring and levels of
challenge. Avoid complex rules and scoring

to maximise limited learning time.

•Deploy or adapt existing gaming strategies

to suit particular learning activities, for

example: adventure games and games with
a strong challenge are suited to learning
activities that need to be made more
attractive to the learner population, while
theory-based simulation games assist with
attitude change issues of conflict or control,
allowing learners to make serious mistakes
in  a risk free environment and highly visual
simulation games can help with group
decision-making.

•Ensure the game has a satisfactory way of
ending.

3    Our  games-oriented  field
research:  summary  findings  and
recommendations

3.1  Research focus

To inform our development of m-portal, we
primarily sought understanding and insights from
the target audience concerning:

•the effect of a games application on the
perception of a device: the influence that

games  may  have  on  young  adults’
perceptions of a device in terms of value
and attractiveness

•interface issues: factors relating to the way a
particular device interfaces between game

and user

•time spent learning the games:the signs
that  target  audiences  will  spend  time

learning rules of computer games rather
than learning other things

•‘learnability’ of mobile games: what kinds of
learning  games  might  engage  target

audiences and what would be the possible
learning gains?

3.2  Theoretical considerations

We consider that one of the most useful
contributions that m-portal research can make to
the project is in designing a new and innovative
m-learning environment guided by theory. Social
constructivism  (Vygotsky 1982)  emphasises
intrinsic learning through social interactions such
as  modeling  or  imitation  and  accepts  the

plurality of meanings. As a theoretical paradigm
we found it especially relevant to m-portal
development: our users may exhibit different
learning styles and preferences and are likely to
be disenchanted with formal, extrinsically
motivated  learning  Furthermore,  social
constructivism considers socio-affective factors
and   the role of mediation of action through
artefacts to be significant in encouraging
learning. Again, this is highly relevant to our m-
portal project, which puts communication tools
in the hands of learners.

Specific social-constructivist theories that
inform the field research include:

�experiential learning theory (Kolb 1984),
understood here as: 'education that
occurs  as a direct participation in the
events of life' (Houle 1980, page 221;
cited by Smith 2001) and achieved
through reflection upon that experience

�  situated learning theory (Brown et al.
1989; Lave 1990), which sees the active
learner graduating from ‘newcomer’ to
‘oldtimer’ within a learning community.

�  Laurillard’s  (1998)  concept  of  a
conversational framework;  this  is
relevant, as it enables a ‘continually
iterative dialogue between teacher and
students to reach shared understanding’.

These theories and concepts already underpin
the conceptual design of m-portal in Phase 1:
the  design  incorporates  a  discursive
functionality to enable people to engage in
debate  on their own terms and to scaffold each
other's learning.

3.3  Methodology

The  m-portal  research  team  comprised
developers and field researchers, including
colleagues normally outside the project but
interested in the field, and potential learners
who were engaged as co-researchers. Such a
collaboration  of  researchers  and  target
audiences is well aligned to the views of social-
constructivism  (Vygotsky  1982)  which
underpins  the  development  of  m-portal  to
ensure it is needs-led, rather than technology-
led. Our approach falls within the naturalistic,
interpretivist paradigm (Denzin and Lincoln
1994). We are seeking to develop ongoing, in-
depth relationships to arrive at holistic accounts
that can afford understandings and insights
from  different  perspectives  and  within
naturalistic  settings  (Patton  1990;  Burgess
1993).   The  researcher’s  role  is  that  of



participant observer, using  the principle of
‘reflection-in-action’  (Schön  1987)  to  guide
aspects of the fieldwork. As will be appreciated,
limited use is made of quantitative data; instead
our approach is to draw inferences from the data
rather than making broad generalisations.

In  operationalising  the  research,  which
followed APU’s internal guidelines for ethics in
research, access was sought to young adults
with our target audiences’ characteristics. Time
was taken to open channels of communication
with colleges and youth centres that worked with
such audiences. The organisations were either
already known to Ultralab or had approached us
following dissemination events. They had all
expressed an interest in the m-learning project.
Among these, a Youth Centre in Reading and a
Community  College  in  Devon  offered
commitment over several months.

Access was facilitated by the Youth Centre
leader and the College director. The young
adults we worked with were of mixed ethnic
background and aged between 16 and 18. This
was opportunity sampling (Bell 1991): we were
not able to recruit a sample of cases covering
the full target audience range. Participants’
willingness to take part may have owed much to
the fact that they knew their mentors or teachers
had agreed to the project, moreover motivation
can change over time (Burgess 1993). However,
our experience was that all the participants
evinced a strong interest in mobile technology
developments throughout. Co-researcher status
had a beneficial effect on their self-esteem and
willingness to contribute.

Data was collected from diverse activities
such  as  conversations  and  discussions
conducted with all the participants, with
individuals and in groups, both face to face and
online. Face-to-face meetings were conducted
with individuals and groups in their natural
environments: Youth Centre meeting rooms and
the  College training room with ICT equipment.
Our expectations were that the young adults
would ‘play’ (ie experiment) with the mobile
devices we gave them to look at, undertaking
the software tasks that were made available.
During and after this process, in face-to-face
sessions and/or online, they would consider and
report back on their perceived learning gains,
sharing their experiences, views and ideas with
each other and with ourselves.

We used a loose structural framework: each
session had a clear agenda. There was some
use of aide-memoires to support conversations
with  a  purpose  (Burgess  1984).  The

conversations were relatively informal with the
researchers playing an active, reflexive part in
the process, not acting as a neutral agent
(Mason 1996) and keeping the conversations
short and easy. In addition there was partial
adoption of a questioning route, both in e-mail
correspondence and also in face-to-face group
discussion. According to Krueger and Casey
(2000) a questioning route aids analysis and
also: ‘forces the moderator or research team to
think about the words and phrases to be used
ahead of time’.

Where questions were asked along the
lines of discussion prepared in advance, this
was kept compatible with the natural flow of
conversation. It had been our original intention
to use audio-visual recordings as a means of
collecting non-verbal clues, but a number of
participants  felt  uncomfortable  with  this
approach.  Instead,  where  permission  was
given,  audio-recordings  were  used  and
transcripts made. Fieldnotes incorporated notes
taken on the spot. Subsequent analysis was
informed by critical use of an analysis protocol
based on guidelines by Dick (2000), following
Glaser’s (1992) grounded theory approach.

The research process was iterative: review
time was built into each session, allowing
further questions to be raised and theories
explored. There was also sufficient time
between sessions to ensure these were geared
to emerging issues. This accords with Glaser’s
(1992) grounded theory, which allows theory to
emerge in an iterative process that is
responsive to the research situation.

Subjectivity  was  inherent,  both  in
implementation  of  field  work  and  in  the
interpretation  of  evidence.  This  can  be
attributed  to  the  ‘Hawthorne  effect’.  The
Hawthorne effect refers to the work of Mayo
(1933), where workers’ production rates at the
Western  Electric  Company  increased  –
however such increase was not due to changes
in working practices, but rather because of the
psychological stimulus of being singled out and
made  to  feel  important.  In  this  case,  the
Hawthorne effect can be applied in at least
three  important  aspects:  the  roles  of  the
Ultralab researchers, of the college participants
and of the technologies themselves. Hence our
attempts at the triangulation of data as a
‘strategy that adds rigor, breadth, complexity,
richness and depth to any inquiry’ (Denzin and
Lincoln 1994, page 5, citing Flick, page 231).



3.4  Field research findings

3.4.1  Effect of the games application on
perception of a device

A device that had games applications
loaded was received more positively than one
that had not. When asked for their general
impressions of the different devices they were
given  to look at, students’ immediate responses
were that games applications make a big
difference; there was a favourable perception of
a  device when it had games, even where it may
previously have been found too large or
unwieldy. This finding was confirmed by further
probing and subsequent voluntary comments.

3.4.2 Interface issues

Size  of  the  device  was  considered
important: ideally phones should fit into a
pocket. Ease-of-use was also a key attractor,
hence the ‘smart-phone’ (a phone which also
contains  some  of  the  attributes  normally
associated with a handheld computer) was liked
because of the easy navigation offered by its
Windows’  environment.  Accessibility  was
another  concern:  speech  bubbles  were
suggested for use with devices that had no
sound and to support users with hearing
difficulties. Icons were liked, also in combination
with text, where they should be small enough to
accommodate a large font. Input was difficult
with small devices: a ‘pen’ facility was preferred
to a mini keyboard – ease and speed making it
‘more fun’.

3.4.3 Time spent learning the games

None of our sample population spent much
time learning mobile games; on the contrary it
was felt games needed clear instructions on how
to  play.  A  preference  was  expressed  for
multiple-choice options.

3.4.4 ‘Learnability’ of mobile games

Mobile games were downloaded and played
frequently by most co-researchers and therefore
can be reasonably expected to engage target
audiences. There were signs that females in
particular enjoyed quiz games. Both males and
females enjoyed fun, challenge and struggle
against some kind of opposition. There need not
be violence: the struggle can be to raise the
level of one’s own performance. They felt games
had potential for great ‘learnability’. This was
particularly  true  of  those  using  multimedia
games.  Crucially,  it  appeared  that  learning
games needed to be perceived to be as good as
commercial programmes.

A colour screen was liked. Fun, speed and
ease of use would be the key to sustaining
engagement.  A  time  element  should  be
incorporated in graphic form – something like
‘Hangman’  (a  game  which  need  not  be
computer based, where the person has to
guess  a word and for each wrong guess part of
the character is drawn – the game ends when
the word is either correctly guessed or the
character completely drawn denoting the game
is  lost). Good design was appreciated, for
example where the game moved from numeral
or icon to word, thereby aiding spelling. The
most engaging activity was one enabling them
to paint virtual walls by solving a simple
equation;  the  correlation  between  visual
aspects of the solution and achieving a correct
answer was the attractor. Short, simple games
were  preferred,  where  it  was  possible  to
complete quickly then move on to the next.
Self-image was involved: completing lots of
easy games boosts the users’ confidence. A
plentiful number and variety of games would be
important: the co-researchers were easily bored
when revisiting the resources, except where the
game was ‘tricky’. Most rejected the idea of
inventing  their  own  games  as  being  too
complex and time-consuming, preferring to
explore what was available on the internet.
However one participant was learning to build a
game; he felt it enhanced prediction skills,
team-building skills and ‘fitting things together’.

Examples of the content that was proposed
for m-portal included a set of interactive
storybooks along the lines of a role-play game.
Games connected with aspects of physics,
such as ‘angles and force’ were also proposed,
as well as games navigating roads using maps
and directions. Sport was felt to be useful in
supporting the development of cognitive and
spatial skills, for example via casino card
games, snooker games, darts and a pinball
game (this was thought best in black and white,
to work well on a small screen). Simulation
games like SIMS™ were thought unsuitable for
most mobile screens – again size was an issue.
Compaq’s  iPAQ  (pocket-sized  personal
computer) screen size was considered to be the
minimum requirement for this type of game.
Examples  of  skills  you  could  learn  in
simulations would be handling money and
communication skills, especially if there was
multiplayer functionality.

High concentration levels were sustained
throughout the time the group spent exploring
the devices and playing the games. There was
confirmation of previous findings, ie there were
signs of the motivating power of the new



technologies and of mobile games, and that
information and applications should be relevant
to users’ interests (for example sport, travel,
hobbies and work). As well as being challenging
and fun to use, the games should also provide
instant feedback, plus a form of reward. The
reward need not be a certificate, but could be
points, money, name in a draw, and so on.

During the games-oriented sessions there
appeared signs of social constructivist learning
and  skills  learning  through  the  sharing  of
discoveries and the exchange of pointers at
getting  round  the  various  challenges  in
manipulating the devices. Furthermore the co-
researchers’ awareness of the beneficial effect
of their status on their own learning and self-
esteem was apparent: they acknowledged with
pride and enjoyment being part of a research
project, to which they felt responsibility and
commitment, relishing the new contacts and
challenges. There were signs of heightened
awareness  of  their  existing  strengths  and
competencies, including those developed via
participation  in  the  project.  This  boost  in
confidence was seen to further their interest in
their own learning and in helping others to learn.
Inspired by a related project that linked mentors
and youngsters via mobile phones, the co-
researchers  proposed  the  use  of texting to
communicate  with  teachers. There  was
evidence of creative thinking, eg reconsidering
their earlier request for clear instructions for
games, they now asked for ‘wizards’ to help
people  around  the  devices,  as  opposed  to
written guides, which they said are simply not
used.

3.5   Recommendations  for mobile
learning developers

This section brings recommendations drawn
from the field research, specifically in respect of
developing mobile learning games for m-
learning target audiences.

•In seeking to engage users in basic skills
learning, lead on from ‘arcade’-type skills.

Start-up procedure should be simple: target
audiences’ threshold of interest and their
concentration may be low.

•To retain interest, make available a variety

of short learning games, still keeping it

simple to minimise levels of frustration and
to maximise the likelihood of satisfactory
outcomes.

•Ensure that game context is relevant to
users’ vocational and leisure interests.

•The type of game should suit both the
content and type of device. Short,

downloadable single-user games worked
particularly well on the kinds of mobile
devices owned by our co-researchers.

•Games need to be fast, fun, easy to use –
and challenging, to encourage cognitive

skills.

•  Cater for user diversity via various
combinations of video, audio and text, use

of colour, and so on.

•  Provide different kinds of feedback: system-
initiated feedback as well as opportunities

to access debrief.

•Where appropriate, link the game to a ‘real-
world’ activity, being played with other

learners.

•Give users control over the learning tools.

4   The potential of a games-
oriented m-portal for encouraging
learning

4.1  The motivating potential of a

games-oriented m-portal

Our findings from both the desk and field
research  point  to  the  motivating,  even
‘addictive’ features of many kinds of computer
and video games. This is the case even with
mobile games, despite the constraints of the
devices – small screen size, limited memory
and battery life, connectivity issues, problems
with input and navigation, and so on.

We find in the literature (eg Kirriemur,
2002) strong indications that multi-user role-
play games in particular can engage target
audiences in social-constructivist learning within
strategic contexts. The finding is compatible
with the experiences reported by our co-
researchers, who all stated they enjoyed using
their mobile phone for communication and
games; most played regularly.

The findings have strengthened our view
that a multi-user role-play game version of m-
portal  could  be  designed  as  a  ‘liberating
structure’ (de Bono 1992), allowing users to try
out  different  learning  modes,  thereby
encouraging attitudinal change, confidence,
curiosity and creativity. These qualities may be
lacking in target audiences owing to exposure
to curriculum approach that has become ‘far too
mechanistic’ (Barlex 2003) ie where the focus is
on movement through grades rather than on
experiential learning.



4.2  Some key challenges in seeking
to implement the idea

The crucial issue in seeking to develop such
m-portal software appears to be that the design
should follow the principles of ‘edugaming’
(Fabricatore  2000),  allowing  the  learner  to
function first and foremost as a player.

Among other real challenges for developers
are the following:

�   A  games-oriented  m-portal  would  in
effect be a simulation game. Although
our  co-researchers  considered  this
game type to be unsuitable for mobile
devices with their very small screens,
there  is  nevertheless  a  basis  for
experimenting with the idea: we could
design for decision-complexity, seen to
be more important than state–space
complexity as a determining factor in
solving a game (van den Herik et al.
2002).

�We would have to contend with the
developmental nature of much of the
technology. We do share with our co-
researchers some concerns about the
ability of the emerging technologies to
deliver a reliable and fast service.

�   Importantly, developing a quality m-
portal gaming environment that stands
up  against  commercial  recreational
software would require heavy resourcing
in terms of both finance and expertise.
This is something that could only be
achieved  in  collaboration  with
commercial developers.

�For the resulting solution to be needs-

led,  developers  should  achieve
collaboration with target audiences.

The last point brings the focus firmly back to
end-users. Their preferences, experiences and
psycho-social and health issues would be vital
areas for future research. In seeking to develop
new approaches to pedagogy, for example in
exploring  how  we  might  vary  feedback
(immediate or otherwise) on decisions, we would
need to investigate what the effects on learners
might be.

4.3  In conclusion

Our research suggests that a multi-user m-
portal that is a true game would bring significant
added  value  as  an  alternative  means  of
attracting  and  engaging  target  audiences,
particularly if used in a ‘hybrid’ learning scenario
such as a combination of face-to-face group

work and mobile activity.  A multi-user games-
oriented  m-portal  facility  could  afford
opportunities for cognitive apprenticeship and
participative learning, enabling users to hone
team skills, social and communication skills and
resource-sharing skills. Finally, and importantly,
if the game assigns ‘co-researcher’ status to
players, this could have a beneficial effect on
their self-esteem, confidence and willingness to
participate; it could be a means of encouraging
a learning culture among target audiences. The
goal is ambitious, but worth exploring further.

Abstract

This work, the result of a master’s project in
interaction design, presents a service model and
some  new  component  concepts  for  lifelong
mobile learning, assuming specific near-term
(within 2–3 years’ time) technologies. Several
prototypes  of  service  components  were
developed and informally tested.

Keywords: mobile learning, service design,
interaction design

1. The benefits of mobile learning as
a service

Mobile  learning  efforts  in  industry  and
academia over the past years have progressed
with a business model of pay-per-device or pay-
per-lesson. Rethinking these in terms of a long-
term service builds on these successes while
adding  additional  opportunities  to  facilitate
blended   learning,   technology   market
penetration,  learner  prompting  and  tight
integration between components.

1.1. Blended learning

The  long-term  relationship  implied  by
subscription to a service provides a broader
structure for blended learning across multiple
devices  and  appropriate  channels,  ie  the
learner’s mobile device, the web, a physical
location like a classroom or office, or even the
post. This enables the service designers to
place components in the environment where
they work best, and learners to use the tools
they prefer.

1.2. Technology market penetration

Early explorations in mobile learning, such
as those conducted in 2001 by Melissa Regan
(Regan 2001) at the Stanford Learning Lab,
indicate that modern cell-phone displays with
current network speeds are not engaging
enough for mobile learning to be effective. A
service model would actively further market
penetration. One of the reasons learners do not
upgrade their mobile equipment is that the
perceived  benefits of upgrading do  not
outweigh the costs. A service model provides
customers with a clear value proposition; a
hypothetical example of this might be ‘If you
choose the deluxe package with the new Nokia
tall-screen Java-enabled phone, you will be
able   to download and use over 50 new learning
modules’. Since hardware costs can be
distributed over the life of the service, perceived
price decreases (Rifkin 2001). Additionally, as
mobile  devices  eventually  fall  into
obsolescence, the service can take advantage
of     the existing relationship in a ‘trade-up’ offer
to keep current technology in the hands of its
clients, and maintain a more sustainable
business practice.

Low-tech service components offered in a
‘starter’  package  also  aid  technology
penetration.  As  the  learner  uses  such
components with their current mobile devices,
they notice points at which better hardware
would  give  them  more  options,  providing
experiential incentive.



1.3. Learner prompting

From research into learning and attention, we
can assume that the efficacy of new devices
suffers as they fade from learners’ attentions.
(Davachi et al. 2001) We can overcome the
effect  of  fading  by  incorporating  learner
prompting  into  our  designs.  With  device-
structured business models, we have to re-
initiate contact with the learner to provide this
prompting. My guess is that since there is no
relationship established, such contact would be
perceived  as  intrusive  and  unwanted,  ie
advertising. Framed within a service, however,
prompts may be welcomed as a helpful aid to
learning and can encourage continued use of
the service.

1.4. Tight integration

Conceiving  the  components  as  a  single
service reveals opportunities for data sharing
between the various inputs and outputs. For
example, in this project, one component involves
the delivery of location-based information and
another allows the client to ask questions of the
service.  By  logging  the  locations  where
questions  were  asked,  we  can  build  the
database  on  which  the  location-based
component relies.

Similarly, one component allows users to ask
free-form questions of the service, which is
forwarded for real-time answers by experts.
Since the service has relationships with many
clients of diverse interests, we can use this client
base as the pool of experts.

Though many of the components described in
this paper are not new, their inclusion as part of
a broader network of integrated components is.

1.5. Extensibility

An ongoing relationship between service and
member allows the service to announce – as
opposed  to  advertise  –  new  technologies,
hardware, and service components as they
become available.

2. Design process

The  vision  of  the  service  model  was
developed in three broad stages.

In the first, representative characters called
personas were developed to embody the target
users of such a service. Example marketing
materials were developed to illustrate likely
motivations for their joining.

In the second, research into learning theories
was used to develop a list of learner needs,
which  were  used  to  develop  service
components.  These  components  were
described using personas and narrative
descriptions called scenarios.

In the last stage, an umbrella service was
conceived and described, under which customers
could select and customise components. Three of
the  components  that use  near-term  future
technologies were prototyped and informally
tested with users in an academic setting.

2.1. Personas

Three personas were developed to represent
potential users of a service for mobile lifelong
learning, based on a survey of current learning
service demographics at four companies –
Empowering Technologies, Global Knowledge,
Sylvan, and SkillSoft.

2.1.1 Ellen: the student

Ellen represents users who might use a
mobile learning service to augment their public
education. She conceives of learning as an
isolated task, dissociated from the things in her
life that she really enjoys.

2.1.2 John: the worker

John represents career-minded learners,
who, in the words of the science journalist
James Burke (1996), ‘will need to reskill
[themselves] constantly every decade just to
keep   a job’. He has little time for training but is
motivated to use the service in his spare
moments.

2.1.3 Keiko: the lifelong learner

Keiko represents self-identified lifelong
learners. She learns for the joy of it and sees it
as a way to connect with her friends and family.
She joins the service for its mobile functionality
and as a personal commitment to her ongoing
learning.

2.2. Developing service components

2.2.1 Learner needs

Overviews of learning theories and methods
led to more detailed readings, notably in Lave
and Wenger’s situated learning (Lave and
Wenger 1991) and communities of practice
(Wenger 1998) theories. From these overviews
and readings, I developed the following list of
learner needs.

1. Positive attitude

2. Self-awareness

3. Goals

4. Learning skills mastery (see below)

5. Learning peers



6. Learning resources (content)

7. Prompting

8. Help

2.2.2 Learning skills

Though  many  learning  theory  sources
referenced learning skills, few concretely named

any of these skills, and none attempted an

8. Memory

9. Metacognition

10. Overcoming information anxiety

11. Searching

Though components were not developed for
each of the skills, they were considered.

2.2.3 Opportunity map

Identified needs were graphed against three
different learning situations: mobile, desktop,
and offline. This grid provided an opportunity
map for service concept (see Figure 1). Where
services  did  not  already  exist  to  fill  an
intersection, new components were developed.
From this map, 13 new service components
were developed. As most of these components
are included in the service description, below,
they are not detailed here. Please note that
there is no room to describe the italicised
service concepts ‘All ears’, ‘Ready rooms’ and
‘Wunderakasten’ in detail here but they are
included in the online documentation of the
project at www.freerangelearning.com

2.2.4 Service ecology

A map of each stakeholder’s relationship to the
service, also known as a service ecology, was
developed to illustrate the value exchange of the
proposed  system.  Developing  the  ecology
broadened the list of stakeholders to include
indirect and peripheral users of the system, such
as schools, employers, and content providers.

2.3. Service vision

The description of the service that follows
includes how potential customers become
aware of the service, how they sign up, and
how they use the service.

2.3.1 Awareness

2.3.1.1 Advertisements

Targeted advertisements could be placed
learning websites, magazines and on college
campuses  to  increase  awareness  of  the
service. Three example advertisements were
created for the service to demonstrate the
different appeals to the different personas. (See
Figures 2, 3 and 4.)

Figure 2. Poster targeting the Ellen persona



Figure 3. Poster targeting the John persona

Figure 4. Poster targeting the Keiko persona

2.3.1.2 Partnerships

A mobile learning company would need to
coordinate  many  different  constituent  parts,
including hardware vendors, mobile operating
system  companies,  and  cellular  service
providers.  Each  of  these  has  an  existing
customer  base  that  might  be  receptive  to
upgrading  or  migrating  to  the  service.
Advertisements  could  be  included  in  these
companies’ existing touch points.

2.3.1.3 Real-time links

Sparacino (2002) demonstrated how user
preferences  could  be  derived  from  user
behaviour in a learning environment. Using the
same model, known as a Bayesian network, the
service  could  integrate  with  the  computer
systems of partner libraries, museums and even
video  rental  stores  to  derive  the  learning
interests of customers. Then, on checkout, the
system could instantly include free information
on  the  receipt  about  further  local  learning
resources for the topic, with a URL for further
information about the service.

2.3.1.4 Point of presence

Younger users, such as Ellen, who associate
learning with their schools, may not take pride in
joining a learning service at first. Other users like
John and Keiko, however, may be proud of their
participation. For these users, customer-exclusive
ring tones and eye-catching idle screens on their
mobile devices may signal their involvement and
invite discussion of the service from others nearby.

2.3.1.5 Website

The service would need to maintain a web
presence  to  inform  potential  users  of  the
service  and  to  allow  for  more  complex
customisation of the service for existing users.
Additionally, the service could provide online
tools that augment and complement mobile
tools, including interface to a learning resource
database, learning chat rooms, and matching
services to find other members with similar
interests.  An example home page of this
website is currently in development.

2.3.2 Ready rooms

At free-choice learning environments, such as
museums and zoos, the service can sponsor small
rooms on the grounds, which provide an overview
of the environment, encourage goal setting, and
provide access to further learning resources on
discovered topics of interest. The rooms would be
free for use, but provide certain services only to
members. The room would contain non-intrusive
advertising materials for the service.

2.3.3 Joining

For the simplest features of the service such
as SMS reference, the Cavalry, and Media
agent, users could sign up on the website. For
other service features that require a proprietary
interface or particular hardware, potential
customers can visit one of the service’s
storefronts.

Customers  would  be  prompted  but  not
required to answer a few questions on joining
so that the service could build a preliminary
learner profile. The learner profile helps the
algorithms that try to match learners to other
learners and to items of interest.

2.3.4 Touch points

There are four main touch points between
the service and the customers: the mobile
device, the website (mentioned above in
2.3.1.5), the storefronts and monthly statements
from the service.

2.3.4.1 Mobile device

The mobile device is assumed to be a
cellular telephone, but the use of any mobile,
wirelessly networked device such as a PDA is
conceivable, as long as it could download and
run the custom applications.

The mobile device would have three main
functions for the user, available from the main
screen of the interface: allowing him or her to
ask questions, watching for things of interest,
and permitting further study.



Asking questions…

On the main screen, users can indicate that
they want to ask a question. The ask screen
allows them to enter a question in text. If their
device allows them to take photographs, it also
provides an option to attach an image to the
question. Once they complete their question,
they have the option to send it to a computer for
automated reference, to a group of pre-defined
peers known as a learning circle, or, for a small
charge, to the service for answering by an
expert.

The format of a question was deliberately
chosen as the means of input because,
according to inquiry-based learning theory (for
example, Postman and Weingartner 1969),
forming questions is a core learning skill that
prepares the learner for an answer, encouraging
understanding and recall.

In each case, when a question is provided to
the system from a mobile learner, the question is
stored in the database with a note of the location
from which it was asked. Doing this helps to
build the location database on which another
component, Genius Loci (see 2.4.3), relies.

…Of a computer

This aspect of the service is called S M S
reference. In it, users structure their queries so
that the server can parse it easily, look up the
answer, and send it via SMS back to them
immediately.  Reference  options  include
dictionary,  thesaurus,  reverse  dictionary,
language  translations  and  abbreviated
encyclopaedia reference. Other references can
be added to meet the interests of the customers.

…Of your learning circle

Via the website, learners can identify the
contact numbers of a group of peers who share
their learning interests. Within the service, these
groups are called learning circles. Customers
provide an alias for the circle and invite them to
accept or decline participation. By sending a
question to the alias, the server automatically
forwards the message to every member of the
circle, facilitating easy group dialogue between
groups of mobile learners.

…Of experts

This component of the service is called The
Cavalry, reinforcing the idea that it might be
called on as a backup if neither SMS reference
nor your learning circle provides an answer.

Upon sending the question to The Cavalry, the
question is parsed for its likely topics and
matched against the learning profiles of other
members of the service who have identified that
they wish to answer questions as experts.
When these members are not themselves
mobile and at their computers, they run a small
application that alerts the server that they are
available to answer questions in exchange for
small credits to their accounts.

When the server identifies a set of matching
experts running the Cavalry application, the
question is forwarded to them. On their
screens, the question and any attached image
are displayed. If they feel they can answer the
question, they can ‘claim’ the question by
clicking a button, at which time the question is
removed from the other experts’ screens. The
expert answers the question as best as they
can in real time by typing it into special fields in
the application. The application sends the
answer back to the server, which forwards it to
the mobile learner.

Upon completing the transaction, the mobile
learner can rate the expert for the clarity and
speed of their response. Experts with many low
ratings are flagged for possible removal from
the system. Experts with many high ratings can
be given more credit for their participation.

Requesting watchers…

In addition to asking questions, customers
can request that their mobile device alert them
to people, places and events of interest. The
customers’ interests are either derived from
their interactions with the server or through the
customer’s directly entered learner profile. The
components are referred to as watchers. Each
relies on the learner’s permission for the system
to track their location via cellular triangulation.

…Of interesting people

This watcher is called Learn Gety, after the
Japanese product Love Gety, which matched
Japanese teenagers with others in their vicinity
according to the settings of a small key chain
device. When on, Learn Gety compares the
learning interests of the mobile learner with the
mobile interests of others in the vicinity and
notifies both parties if there is a topic match.
The interaction design supports control and
safety  for  the  participants,  including  post-
conversation ratings for collaborative filtering.



…Of interesting places

When mobile learners activate the Genius
Loci watcher, their learner profile and location
are compared against the database. Learners
are alerted to the nearby item of interest via text
and, if available, an image.

Learners can set maximum limits for these
alerts to avoid being barraged.

It was noted above that learner questions
are part of the database on which this service
component  relies.  This  assumes  that
something in the environment triggered the
question in the first place. Since this is not
always the case, ie people often think of things
unrelated to their location, these items in the
database are treated differently. They  are
represented tentatively to users of the Genius
Loci   in the form of a question, eg ‘Do you see a
church nearby? One user asked the following
about a church in this location’. If a number of
learners answer ‘no’ to such a question, the
question is removed from the Genius Loci
database. If a number of learners answer ‘yes’
then the question is ‘solidified’ in the database
and treated as concrete.

…Of interesting events

As learning events are entered into the service
database, they are tagged for their topics. These
are automatically compared against the learning
profiles of customers who have activated the
Media Agent watcher. These customers are
notified of the event. Using the device interface,
they can indicate if they would like to attend. If so,
they can use the service to make reservations
and any ticket purchases required.

Once accepted, the system can compare the
event topic against the learner’s other topic
interests and check to see if there is any link in
the database between them. If there is, the
system can send the message to the learner
around the time they are attending, helping to
connect their current interests and encourage
lateral thinking. If such a link does not exist in the
database, the system can automatically submit it
as a question to experts in the Cavalry pool.

Further study

While the screens of mobile devices are not
large enough to present engaging content, some
customers may wish to study more about their
interests while mobile. For these customers, the
service provides learning modules tailored for
mobile use.

To overcome the limitations of the screen
interface, the service includes – at an extra
charge – the use of Body Learning modules.
These are marked as such when lists are
browsed online or via the mobile device. To use
a Body Learning module, customers must pick
up or receive via post a small ‘backpack’ for
their mobile device, which provides sensor
information about the environment in which it is
being used, such as bearing, tilt and even
temperature.  Body  Learning  modules  can
reference this data to try and engage the
learner more effectively than could a screen
and audio alone.

2.3.4.2 Offices

While the main interactions are conceived as
being with the user through digital means,
certain aspects of the service require a physical
presence, including  service and  equipment
maintenance,  meeting  places  for  learning
circles  and  lectures,  computer  access  and
analogue references.

The service would not necessarily need its
own storefronts, as this is costly. Instead, the
service could partner with businesses that have
existing infrastructures to provide a presence at
these locations, eg cellular service providers.

In addition, the service could partner other
entities such as libraries, schools, museums
and community centres for the use of their
spaces as appropriate.

2.3.4.3 Monthly statements

Being a service, customers are charged
each month for use of the service in the
previous month. These statements can arrive
via e-mail or post, depending on the customer’s
preference, and provide a small, recurring
opportunity to update customers on service
changes  or  upgrades  as  well  as  new
opportunities. It is also an opportunity to
congratulate them on their level of participation
and success in the service, helping the learner
with the first learner need identified above.

2.4. Experience prototyping

Testing services of this implied complexity is
difficult without developing deep infrastructures.
Given the scope of the project, experience
prototypes of four of the components for the
proposed  service  were  built  instead:  SMS
Reference, The Cavalry, Body Learning and
Genius Loci. These were selected as they
represented one component from each of the



mobile device functions, and because their
underlying technologies were near-term and fully
realisable in 2–3 years’ development time. They
were developed to a point of unsupervised
usability and given to users to use in controlled
environments.  Afterwards,  users  were
interviewed about usability and viability issues.

2.4.1 SMS Reference and The Cavalry

In this prototype, volunteers with cell phones
were given access to a special phone number
for 9 days. During this time, they could send
SMS requests to the number for automated
dictionary,  thesaurus,  Italian–English  or
English–Italian  translation  lookups.  The
receiving   cell phone sent the request via a
cradle cable to a computer (see Figure 5)
running a custom-written Java server. The
program stored the request in a log file, parsed
it, scraped responses from websites, formatted
the responses, and sent the response back to
the phone for immediate delivery (see Figure 6).
Response time was typically within 10 seconds.

Users could also use the same system to
send open-ended questions to the service. In
response to such questions, the system e-
mailed the question to the author, who would
research the answer and manually send an SMS
response. Response times varied but were
usually provided within an hour.

Users were surveyed at the end of the week,
in which they could review their logged queries,
provide the location and circumstances of each
query and answer questions about the
experience.

SMS Reference service

2.4.1.1 Experience prototype results

Some  small  usability  problems  were
discovered in the test. For example, the first
iteration of the service used a dash as the
command delimiter, eg  ‘d-mobile’  was  the
correct command to request a dictionary lookup
of the word ‘mobile’. It was discovered that for
most of the test subject’s cell phone interfaces,
dashes are difficult characters to find and enter,
accessible only through submenu systems that
made the requests unnecessarily complex. In
subsequent tests, the use of a delimiter was
omitted, so that the command ‘d smile’ would
suffice. Although this required slightly more
complex programming so that it could handle
multiple-word requests, the benefits in usability
warranted the change.

The responses indicated interest in such a
service. Eight of nine volunteers said in post
interviews that they would agree to have a small
monthly fee added to their phone bill for the
continued use of the service. The ninth volunteer
became frustrated with the command syntax and
when she finally mastered it, discovered that the
word she requested, ‘diegetic’, was not in the
referenced  dictionary.  In  her  response  she
clarified that given a better dictionary, she would
be interested in such a service. All would opt for
a charge per request rather than a monthly
service fee, at an average acceptable price point
of 14 cents (euro) per request.

Volunteers  reported  a  wide  variety  of
circumstances that prompted their requests.
Duplicate  circumstances  included  native
English speakers trying to explain a word with
an intricate definition to non-native speakers,
settling debates in conversation, and cooking
using foreign-language and metric instructions.
Significantly, three reported that they felt more
empowered  to  ask  questions  about  things
around them.



The surveys revealed an unexpected aspect
of the experience. Users reported that the time
delays involved with the Cavalry service were
not always important. While a few users needed
their information immediately, most felt it was
enough to be able to ‘capture’ the question at
the moment they thought of it. For example, one
user lost his cell phone for two days. When he
found it and read the response to an earlier
query, he was immediately reminded of the
moment he asked the question and felt the time
delay reinforced his interest in the topic.

2.4.1.2 Near-term technologies

Java-enabled  mobile  devices:  Testing
revealed that the SMS platform limitation of 160
characters is a significant barrier to usability on
long system responses as few users’ phones
employed  long  SMS  capabilities.  On  Java-
enabled mobile devices with greater display
capabilities, this service could be built with a
custom interface so that the user does not have
to deal with these limitations, facilitating use of
long  responses  and  integration  of  photo
attachments.

Easy text entry: In the United States, SMS is
not yet a standard service and relatively few
people know how to use it. In Europe, not all
phones possess the ease of T9 text entry. As
the  services  rely  on  text  entry,  these
technologies incrementally add to the usability
and thereby viability of the components. Middle-
term future technologies may even enable on-
board speech-to-text for even more ease of use.

2.4.2 Body Learning

In this experience prototype, a Tablet PC was
augmented with sensors: an accelerometer and
two compass chips, letting the device detect its
tilt and cardinal direction (see Figure 7). This
information was used to control a constellation
browser module, which matched the tilt of the
Tablet PC against a star map, enabling direct
comparison with the night sky. By pressing one
of the number keys on the interface, users could
view the constellation lines and names (see
Figure 8), which would fade over the course of a
few seconds. A different button would display
the same information without fading.

Figure 7. The sensor ‘backpack’ affixed to
the back of a Tablet PC

Figure 8. A detail of the constellation
browser, showing some constellations and the
horizon line

Four volunteer students were given this
device and asked to use it one evening to find
their star sign constellation in the sky. They
were asked to try it with key control of the angle
and once using the sensors (see Figure 9).
Afterwards they were given questionnaires
about their experience.

Figure 9. The constellation browser in use



2.4.2.1 Experience prototype results

The students spent 30 minutes in total with
the device, switching between users, who acted
as guides, and others, who spent time watching
the sky. Each found their constellation using the
sensors first. Three were able to find it in the sky
afterwards. The fourth student’s constellation
had not risen yet, but the student was pleased to
know where it would rise. All enjoyed looking at
the foreign constellations visible ‘under the
ground’ using the device.

When the sensors were disabled and the
students asked to use key control to move the
display, they reported that the experience was
as enjoyable, but entirely different. Manually, the
task was to apply knowledge learned with the
sensors. One of the users asked to switch back
and forth between the manual and automatic
mapping modes to test his guesses.

The students spent time connecting their
constellation with other nearby or well-known
constellations, to aid their memory. For this they left
the constellations visible rather than use the fading
display. None reported preferring the fading mode.

Some usability problems were uncovered in
the  questionnaire.  The  students’  eyes  had
difficulty adjusting between the backlit LCD
screen (even with a black background and
dimmed graphics) and the night sky. The size
and  the  weight  of  the  Tablet  PC  became
uncomfortable during the demo, making them
want to cradle the device and not hold it up to
the sky. These issues would not be identical in
the ideal implementation.

In the questionnaire, the students were able
to imagine some surprising applications for such
a device for their own learning interests
including 3D time-scrolling displays of historical
sites while on vacations, distant-object labelling
for panoramic views, and exploring famous
artworks. All noted that they would probably not
use the device in their daily lives on a regular
basis, and so would be most interested in
renting them while on vacation or visiting art
galleries, rather than including the cost of a
device in their service.

2.4.2.2 Near-term technologies

The backpack: Though the compass chips
and accelerometer components of the backpack
are common technology and readily available,
as tested they are costly, fragile, and bulky. An
electrical engineer and product designer would
need to develop smaller and more usable
devices for particular mobile learning devices.

Java-enabled mobile devices: Mobility and
usability dictate that users should be able to
browse and download modules ‘on the fly’. This
is easiest to accomplish on Java-enabled
devices.

2.4.3 Genius Loci

As location-based information accumulates
and overlaps, personalised filtering for topics of
interest becomes paramount (Sheth 1994). In
this  experience  prototype,  a  database  of
location-based, Italian-language information
was  built.  Five  adult  students  who  were
currently enrolled in an intermediate Italian
class  were  given  a  Tablet  PC  containing
custom-written Java and Macromedia Director
applications (see Figure 10). These applications
interfaced with an off-the-shelf wireless network
positioning  engine,  called  the Ekahau
Positioning Engine.

The students were given the Tablet PC and
asked to tour the building, looking for space
tags  (see  Figure  11).  Their  instructor
accompanied them. Afterwards, they were
given vocabulary tests of the items they
encountered, and asked to complete a survey
of    the experience.

prototype

Figure 11. The Genius Loci prototype in use



2.4.3.1 Experience prototype results

The students enjoyed the novelty of the
device and the ‘treasure hunt’ style of learning.
One expressed a desire to be able to hear the
words displayed. Other students agreed with
this. Another student wished to read example
sentences with the words.

The accuracy of the engine is not perfect or
instantaneous, and this, combined with the
limitations of the prototype, led to some
frustrations among the users, who expected
immediate response from the system and more
control.

In the post-prototype  questionnaires, the
students remembered most of the words they
encountered in English. They could only recall
the Italian translations of the words less than
60% of the time, but no great emphasis was
placed on the results.

The post-prototype questionnaires explained
the differences between this experience and the
experience of the actual service. When asked to
imagine the service throughout their town, all
indicated that they would pay a small price on
their monthly phone bill, as they felt it would be a
positive aid to their Italian studies. Given control
over the number of responses per day, they
would request an average of four messages per
day as when they were mobile. The average
acceptable maximum price for such a service
was 3 euros per month.

2.4.3.2 Near term technologies

Ubiquitous  wireless  networks  and
continuous location-aware devices: To be truly
mobile, Genius Loci needs its location awareness to
transfer seamlessly between GPS networks and
wireless networks. According to the Fourth-
Generation Mobile Forum, 4G wireless network
standards promise the interoperability to dojust this.

The Forum estimates that 4Gcould become a
reality as early as 2006.

3. Conclusion

Informal tests of components indicate that
students would be willing to subscribe to a
mobile learning service. This supports the main
hypothesis of this paper, that for several
reasons, a service structure is more likely to be
a viable business and lifelong learning model
than pay-per-object or pay-per-lesson models.
The tests conducted, however, are neither
statistically significant nor a proper test of this
larger hypothesis.  Though these results are
encouraging, further development and testing
are needed.

Abstract

This  paper  reports  and  discusses  the
deployment of Multimedia Tour Systems by Tate
Modern in 2002 and 2003, using handheld
computers or personal digital assistants (PDAs)
on  a  wireless  network  in  the  galleries.
Developed in collaboration with Antenna Audio,
these  projects  have  piloted  interactive,
contextual educational content and applications
for visitors. The information gathered to date is
the first step to providing a blueprint that will
help to inform the development of handheld
technologies for museums and other institutions
in the coming years.

learning, access for deaf visitors

1.  Tate Modern Multimedia Tours

Audio  guides  have  been  part  of  the
interpretation and education strategy since Tate
Modern  opened  in  May  2000.  Having
established a reputation for delivering excellent
audio  tours  (with  award  winning  tours  for
children and for the visually impaired), Tate
Modern would like to remain at the cutting edge
of educational technology by helping to shape a
new generation of multimedia tours.

Preliminary research into multimedia by Tate
saw the development of a multimedia tour pilot in
collaboration with Antenna Audio, which was tested
in the galleries between July and September 2002.
Tate and Antenna Audio are now collaborating on a
second-phase pilot in 2003 which will expand the

wireless network and applications developed in
2002  to  focus  on  interactive  educational
programmes and contextual learning for younger
visitors (aged 16–25) to Tate Modern’s permanent
collection galleries. The 2003 project will also test a
text-based tour of the permanent collection, and a
British Sign Language Guide offering signed
interpretation of selected objects on display.

1.2. Multimedia Tour pilot 2002

In  July  2002,  Tate  Modern  (London)
launched a unique, interactive, audio-visual tour
of its galleries. Using the latest developments in
wireless technologies and handheld computing,
this 3-month pilot project was the first of its kind
in any museum in the world. The tour was
sponsored by Bloomberg and developed in
association with Antenna Audio. The iPaq
3850s and network equipment used in the pilot
were loaned by Hewlett Packard.

Unlike  the  existing  audio  tours  in  UK
museums, the Multimedia Tour (MMT) allowed
background information about the works on
display to be provided to visitors in a variety of
different media on a portable screen-based
device. Visitors could see video and still images
that gave additional context for the works on
display, and could listen to an expert talk about
details  of  a  work,  while  the  details  were
simultaneously highlighted on their screen.
Interactive  screens  encouraged  visitors  to
respond to the art on view, for instance by
answering questions or by layering a collection
of sound clips to create their own soundtrack for
a work.



The location-sensitive wireless network
meant that visitors no longer needed to spend
time searching the multimedia tour to find the
relevant information for a room, because the
network pinpointed their exact location in the
gallery and fed the correct information to them at
the right time. Because this information came
from a central server, rather than being stored in
the memory of the hand-held device, practically
limitless content could be provided, and could
easily be kept up –to date. A further benefit of
connecting the tour to a network is that visitors
could request the central server to send
additional information about the art they saw to
their home e-mail address. It also meant that
Tate could broadcast messages to users during
the tour, and send automated alerts when the
film or other programmed events were about to
start.

Figure 1A visitor to Tate Modern takes the 2002
multimedia tour pilot

Although this technically innovative pilot
often pushed the technology to its limits and
beyond, visitors were enthusiastic about both
the service and the tour. Visitors generally see
this technology as an exciting and inevitable
part of the future landscape in museums. The
British Academy of Film and Television Arts
(BAFTA)  agreed  that  the  multimedia  tour
enhanced  the  visitor  experience  at  Tate
Modern, remarking in its award to Tate Modern
and Antenna Audio for technical innovation that:

Genuinely groundbreaking, this was an
exciting  demonstration  of  how  new
technology  can  be  used  to  enhance
museum and gallery visits. Using a hand-
held  wireless  device  that  knows  just
where you are on the tour, this offers a
stimulating array of material to add to, but
not confuse, the experience of a gallery
visit.  Commendably,  Tate  Modern  is
working with day-to-day feedback from
visitors  to  develop  a  system  that
complements  an  already  stunning
physical learning space.

BAFTA 2002

1.3.1  Visitor demographics

The largest group of visitors fell in the 26–40
age bracket, with 26% of visitors aged 18–25,
24% aged 41–60, 9% aged 10–17 and 4% over

61.

•42% of visitors were female and 58%
male

•56% of visitors were British

•18% were North American

•17% were from continental Europe.

The remaining 8% were from the rest of the
world (1% did not respond to this question)


1.3  Visitor feedback

The pilot tour was taken by 852 visitors who
completed  evaluation  forms  recording  their
experiences. In addition, qualitative focus group
studies were conducted by the Susie Fisher
Group. The software system used in the trial
also logged all uses of the MMT and provided a
statistical picture of how the tour was used,
which rooms were visited, and how the visitor e-
mail system was used.

1.3.2  Visitor satisfaction

The average amount of time visitors spent
taking the tour was 55 minutes.

Over 70% of visitors said they had spent
longer in gallery than they would have without
the MMT, and a similar percentage said that the
MMT had improved their visit to Tate Modern.

In  general,  older  visitors  found  the
technology more difficult to use than younger
visitors. Overall 55% of visitors found the MMT
easy to use, while 45% found it difficult.



1.4  Content findings and
recommendations

In addition to testing the technology and visitors’
responses to it, the primary aim of the MMT pilot
was to test a variety of approaches to content
design. The content proved to be the primary draw
of the MMT, and indeed it will be the quality of the
content that ultimately determines the success or
failure of the tour experience.

The findings and recommendations made
below regarding content design are based on
Antenna staff experiences, the questionnaires,
and feedback from focus groups conducted by
the Susie Fisher Group.

1.4.1  What worked

Interestingly, users did not seem to find multi-
tasking and multi-tracking of different media (eg
looking between screen and artwork) a problem
as long as the message was well designed and
the  PDA  was  functioning  properly.  The
multimedia tour clearly had the effect of making
the visitor look longer at an object than s/he
would have otherwise, even though the screen
was also commanding attention. As Susie Fisher
reported, ‘Visitors can multi-track with great
ease, even when the input tracks (audio, screen,
painting) are not synchronized with one another’
(Fisher 2002, Chart 34).

In this regard, ‘audio acts like a friend’, and
indeed more use could be made of the audio to
direct the user’s eye movements between the
object, the screen and navigation through the
gallery space.

In both the questionnaires and focus groups,
visitors’ favourite stops on the tour featured the
following design approaches:

•audio-visual coherence: a strong logical
link between the audio and the visual

•interactives: interactive messages, in
which visitors had a chance to respond

to artworks or register their opinions

•  audio: interviews with artists, sitters,
and related experts, as well as good

audio navigational instructions

•  video: eg using the screen to explain
the process of making a work (this was

considered by several visitors to be a
good use of the screen, but also a
potential distraction)

•intuitive, interactive interfaces: to
help visitors find information quickly

and easily.

1.4.2  What didn’t work

Features that did not work:

•long messages: attention spans seem

to be even shorter  for interactive

messages than for traditional audio tour
messages

•blank screens: the screen should be
usefully occupied at all times, but

without distracting from the exhibits

•text: received a mixed response: some

– particularly more ‘art experienced’

visitors – liked having wall labels in the
palm of their hand, while others wanted
more exciting content

•help menu: a key to the navigation icons

is essential to remind visitors of the

functions and options available to them.

Moreover:

•Visitors wanted MORE of everything:
more objects on the tour, and more

information about each.

•Just as in audio tours, the multimedia tour
can take attention away from other objects

in the gallery that are not on the tour.
Therefore careful tour design is essential.

1.5  Multimedia Tour pilot 2003

Tate and Antenna Audio are now building on
the results of the 2002 pilot to create a second-
stage pilot with a view to producing a product
that can be rolled out for full public use in the
galleries over an extended period of time. This
year  Tate’s  multimedia  project  is  again
sponsored by Bloomberg, with hardware loans
by Toshiba, including the e750 PDAs that
visitors will use in the galleries.

The information gathered to date is the first
step to providing a blueprint that will help to
inform handheld technologies for museums and
other institutions in the coming years. The



development  of  this  second-stage  project
includes a particular focus on the interactive
potential of the devices. The areas indicated
below will be key areas of research:

•  enabling visitors to communicate directly
with the gallery, eg posing and answering

questions

•enabling visitors to page each other in peer-
to-peer communication

•enabling visitors to access online databases
while in the gallery, and to e-mail

themselves further information on objects
and artists on the tour in order to follow up
on artists and artworks of interest through
the Tate website.

•  improving  processing  speeds,  tour
interface, operating system stability, and

location-sensitive content delivery systems.

In addition to this multimedia content, visitors
to Tate Modern’s second-phase trial will be able
to try a text-based tour of the permanent
collection, drawing from Tate’s databases of
information held for every object on display.

The second-phase trial will also include a test
of a British Sign Language guide for deaf
visitors. Deaf visitors will be able to see video
footage of sign language interpretation about
selected works in the permanent collection. The
aim of the Sign Language guide is to increase
access for deaf visitors not only to the objects on
display, but also to the fields of study addressed
in the galleries by enabling familiarity with the
signs and art terms relevant to these discourses.

Figure 2 The 2003 Tate Modern pilots will include
a test of the use of the wireless PDA for Sign
Language guides to provide deaf visitors with
interpretation on demand

In terms of content, the 2002 pilot tour explored
a variety of contrasting approaches to delivering
information about the art on display. We now
want  to pinpoint the most successful methods
for a range of audiences, and refine them to
create specifically tailored multimedia learning
models for visitors.

As in 2002, visitors to the 2003 tours are
asked to fill in a questionnaire about their
experience, and focus groups will be conducted
with external evaluators. Early responses have
indicated that the effort put into researching
visitors’ preferences in 2002 is paying off; here
are some selected comments from the first
users of the Multimedia Tour, which opened to
the public on October 1:

I like very much the way it draws your
attention to and from the screen and artwork.

I am not usually a fan of audio guides but I
found using the PDA very, very informative.

Brings art alive through words, pictures and
music – a fabulous way of scoping the gallery.

I found the experience of using the PDA very
informative, and especially so, on peripheral
issues to the works. I particularly liked hearing
the artists' views and their tastes in music. I
think as a result I probably spent three or four
times longer in the gallery rooms.

The 2003 tours run until 20 December, 2003.
Articles summing up the results of these trials
will be produced from early 2004.

Usability and accessibility of personal digital assistants as
assistive technologies in education

Abstract

Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are a
reasonably new and emerging technology that is
rapidly evolving, although their use as an
educational tool or assistive technology has only
just started. This paper looks at the accessibility
and usability of the devices (from their physical
characteristics to the graphical user interface
and   device controls or input methods). It also
suggests possible uses for these handheld
devices  as an assistive technology (technologies
for those with disabilities that make studying
easier or more accessible).

Keywords: accessibility, usability, PDA,
education

1. Introduction

A report from TechLearn states that:

PDAs are important devices that can be used to
enhance the learning and teaching environment.
Students and staff enjoy using them and they
seem to increase student motivation. When
fitted with a keyboard, they are very useful for
taking notes in lectures.

This paper describes the accessibility problems
related to common features of PDAs and how
students with specific disabilities benefit from
some features and are hindered by others.

One aspect of the use of PDAs in education
that has not been fully explored is their use as
an assistive technology. This paper
summarises the main areas in which PDAs
might   be a useful tool.

The PDA market is always changing, more so
perhaps than the desktop market. For the
purpose  of this research we only looked at PDAs:

•small enough to be held in the average
adult hand

•  easily operated

•at the forefront of the current
technology.

These PDAs are differentiated by their
operating systems, such as Palm OS, Pocket
PC and so on.

2. Accessibility and common
features of a PDA


(Smith 2003)

In these situations consideration must be given
to students who have a disability or specific
learning difficulty.

2.1.1  Body (size, shape and weight), touch

screen/display and styli)

PDAs should ideally fit easily into the average-
sized hand and be easy to hold. Tactile grips



could provide greater support for those with
manual dexterity problems.

Ideally, PDAs and their peripheral devices
should be easily portable and not too heavy, and
this does seem to be the aim of most designers.
However, at present most add-ons are fiddly to
connect and cannot be considered very robust.

2.1.2  Hardware design

People who have lost some sensitivity in their
fingers or have manual dexterity problems, and
those who are visually impaired, would benefit
from better designed buttons and switches with
clear markings and tactile additions, such as
those offered on some mobile phones. Buttons
should be raised or clearly identifiable (both
visually and by feel) and be in ergonomic
positions. Some PDAs require far too much
fiddly scrolling or direction twiddling to produce
actions on the screen.

2.1.3  Touch screens/displays

People with visual impairments and those with
reading difficulties may find coping with text on a
small PDA a problem. Screens should ideally
have good-quality resolution, a reasonable
colour depth and clear screen lighting. However,
as with all computer monitors and text that
scrolls down or across a screen, it is a question
of testing the tools in different environments, if
possible. A dark area needs a bright screen and
a monochrome PDA chosen in a shop may not
suit the user when the daylight fades.

2.1.4  Switches/buttons

Providing good support for hardware buttons to
allow those operating PDAs with limited
movement (perhaps manual dexterity problems
or single handed) would increase a PDA’s
usability.

All functions or operations should be available
via keyboard commands (if a peripheral
keyboard has been added or connected). The
hardware (or fixed software screen) buttons
should  be intuitive and customisable to allow the
user to perform all navigational functions and
most operational commands without using a
stylus.

2.1.5  Operating systems/graphical user
interfaces

People with visual impairments will have
problems reading the text and graphics on the
display as well as identifying the functions of
the hardware buttons. They may benefit from
the ability to resize text or magnify graphics and
change the colour or contrast of a display.

External keyboards with shortcuts for navigation
may be necessary as well as an external
magnifying glass. But it has to be accepted that
these devices may not be accessible or usable
unless they have been specifically designed for
the purpose, like the PAC Mate by Freedom
Scientific. Pulse Data also provide a Palm
application that connects BrailleNotes to Palm
PDAs (via a serial cable) so that a user can
show  a sighted person what they have been
writing in Braille.

People with specific learning difficulties or
dyslexia may find some of the complex
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) provided on
some PDAs confusing – those trying Pocket
PCs will come across cramped toolbars and
menus with long lists. All small screens tend to
result in a lack of 'white space' and there is
usually little chance to choose a favourite font.
Once again it may help to resize text or
graphics and change the colour or contrast of a
display.

People with hearing impairments may not have
any difficulties with the GUI interface and
operating system. However, for those who tend
to communicate in sign language and find
English difficult, the PDA language may be
confusing. There is a type of technological
jargon   that runs throughout all the websites,
manuals and forums and it is with this issue in
mind that we have produced a glossary, which
can be found at:
www.techdis.ac.uk/PDA/glossary.htm

People with mobility and dexterity difficulties
may not have any problems looking at the GUI
interface but when they try to access it with a
stylus, small button or keyboard, manipulation
issues may arise. The options for mouse or
switch access are limited but remote control,
infra-red (IR) and short-range radio frequencies
(eg Bluetooth), may be the way forward. In fact
those with major mobility and communication
difficulties have been using GUI interface
communication aids for a long time. These are
often  larger than the usual PDA but now
examples of the Pocket PC PDAs with speech
output and a simple interchangeable grid



systems can be found at Sensory Software
International (www.sensorysoftware.com/).

Ideally the GUI should be intuitive and have
user-friendly navigation and functionality with a
clear, readable, uncluttered visual design that
can be resized or enlarged. The operating
system should support large enough graphics to
allow easy viewing and stylus control.

2.1.6  Batteries

The longer the battery life, the better! Most
students will be at university or college for up to
eight hours a day and will have different usage
needs. Some older PDAs use small AA batteries
or have back-up batteries but most now depend
on an AC charger and it can help to choose a
model that does not require a cradle for
charging.

2.1.7  Expansion slots, ports and connectors

For those with disabilities who require extras to
make their PDAs accessible and usable it is
often essential to consider devices that offer:

�the means to add additional memory
(useful if you wish to store a large
volume of files, or run memory-hungry
programs like text-to-speech or voice
memos)

�additional means of backing up data to a
desktop PC or other storage device,
perhaps by an infra-red port or a cable

�the chance for the PDA to be connected
to a network or mobile phone for local
file access or/and the internet

�additional connectors for peripherals,

such as a printer, modem, mass storage
devices (hard drives), camera and more.

2.1.8  Docking stations and synchronisation
cradles

As has been mentioned, the difficulties that tend
to arise with this aspect of using a PDA are
related to dexterity and being able to slot the
PDA into the fitting. Plugging in cables and
setting up the synchronisation through the
hardware button or software synch program on
the computer or PDA can be fraught with
frustration if it does not go smoothly.

2.1.9  User alerts

People with hearing impairment would benefit
from a vibrating alert to accompany an alarm.

Ideally the auditory alarm should have a
variable pitch and volume to allow for people
with different hearing ranges.

Visual alerts such as a flashing light emitting
diode (LED) or flashing display screen would
help users with visual and/or hearing difficulties
and those who do not wish to disturb others – in
a library, for instance.

3. Disability and generic features

There follows a summary of:

•aspects that affect those with
disabilities

•generic features that could be helpful to
all users.

It is grouped by disability:

•blind and visually impaired

•specific learning difficulties/dyslexia
and other cognitive difficulties

•  deaf/hearing impairment

•  manual dexterity

•  mobility impairment

•speech and language difficulties.

3.1.1  Blind and visually impaired

As has been said, a person with a visual
impairment may find using a PDA problematic
mainly because of the size and clarity of the
display. They may also find the layout of
hardware buttons on a PDA difficult to
distinguish and use.

Features that may hinder accessibility:

�small screen size

�low screen resolution

�small standard font size

�short sentence wrapping distance

�small touch screen sensitivity areas

�poor screen contrast control

�poor (font, back or side) lighting for the
screen

�buttons with a low tactile quality

�buttons with small labelling or
symbolism.

Features that make accessibility better:

�‘live’ text-to-speech (screen reading
and document reading)

�speech recognition (both text
transcription and for 'actioning'
commands)

�an external screen magnifier



�keyboard commands with navigational
prompts.

3.1.2  Specific learning difficulties/dyslexia and
other cognitive difficulties

People with specific learning difficulties may find
that some of the accessibility features
mentioned in the blind/visually impaired section
will also apply because they may have a visual
processing deficit or be a 'visual learner'.

Features that may hinder accessibility:

•counter-intuitive layout of hardware

buttons that action functional commands

(eg badly aligned hardware)

•buttons for cursor navigation control

•counter-intuitive location or actions of
fixed onscreen buttons

•poor use of symbolism/icons and visual
representations of actions or commands

•lack of multimedia options

•poor quality calendar or diary functions
that could be invaluable for those with

short-term memory difficulties.
Features that make accessibility better:

•‘live’ text-to-speech (screen reading and
document reading)

•speech recognition (both text
transcription and for 'actioning'

commands)

•simple graphical navigational aids

•clear menu structures.

3.1.3  Deaf/hearing impairment

Many of the difficulties that deaf users may
encounter have already been mentioned and are
often the same issues that arise when using
mobile phones.

Features that may hinder accessibility:

•alerts that are purely auditory (eg a
sharp tone when user errors occur)

•complex use of PDA-specific language.

Features that make accessibility better:

•  vibrating alert

•  flashing LED

•flashing display and/or light.

3.1.4  Manual dexterity

A person with manual dexterity problems may
find manipulating or using a PDA in their hands
cumbersome or difficult. They may lack the
dexterity needed to coordinate simultaneously
holding and using a PDA. Most of the PDAs we
have looked at have touch screens and the GUI
can be activated by touch or using the physical
button.

Features that may hinder accessibility:

�holding a PDA for 'in hand use'

�type of force or fine touch required to
action buttons or other physical controls

�small size and/or non-ergonomic
shapes of buttons

�where stylus or touch screen controls
are the only option

�small, thin, hard-to-grip styli

�poor operating system support for
hardware accessories (such as
additional keyboards).

Features that make accessibility better:

�PDA cases designed with materials that
increase friction and grip

�an overall shape that allows the device
to be held comfortably in the average
adult hand

�larger, more ergonomic styli that are
more easily gripped

�the availability of keyboards or other
hardware data input devices

�speech recognition (both text
transcription and for 'actioning'
commands).

3.1.5  Mobility impairment

A person with mobility impairment may have
difficulty in moving from place to place, due to a
physical or medical constraint. They may find
the portability of a PDA useful. On the other
hand, gross motor impairments might cause
operational difficulties.

Features that may hinder accessibility:

�the 'handheld' nature of PDAs, often
not toughened

�  heavy weight

�short battery life requiring regular
charging.

Features that make accessibility better:

�the availability and/or feasibility of
mounting brackets for use with a desk,
wheelchair or in a fixed location



�a means of portable battery recharging

�speech recognition (both text
transcription and for actioning
commands).

3.1.6  Speech and language difficulties

A person with a speech or language difficulties
may find it hard to cope with complex technical
language and may prefer to use symbol or
graphical-based communication systems.

Features that may hinder accessibility:

�poor use of symbolism/icons and visual
representations of actions or commands

�poor speech output from written text or
picture grids, ie audible text-to-speech

�poor-quality built-in speakers

�lack of multimedia options.

Features that make accessibility better:

�‘live’ text-to-speech (screen reading and
document reading)

�better in-built memory to cope with
speech output.

4.  The use of a PDA as an assistive
technology

4.1.1  Assistive technology for all

PDAs can be of use to many people with and
without disabilities. The following lists uses that
could benefit people with a range of disabilities
(or none):

•note taking – using a text editor or word
processor for taking notes (in most

cases this would also require a
peripheral keyboard)

•viewing/storing reference materials –
using a customised PDA database, text

editor files, or e-book/e-doc files to store
and present information (such as
sections of a textbook, old essays,
lecture notes, etc)

•diary planner – using an electronic diary
and planner for an academic timetable.

The following looks at the specific ways in which
a PDA may be used as an assistive technology
device in an educational setting and is grouped
by functional difficulties.

The following application types can be useful for
those with short-term and working memory
problems:

•  reference databases

•electronic material readers (e-doc
readers, text editors and word

processors)

•electronic reminders and user alarms

•  to-do/task lists.

The following application types can be useful
for those with time management and
organisational difficulties:

•  to-do/task lists

•  diary planners/calendars

•electronic reminders and user alarms.

The following application types can be useful
for those with difficulties with writing skills and
structuring thought processes:

•  outline tools

•  mind/concept mapping

•text editors (or word processors, for
note-taking).

The following application types can be useful
for those with problems with spelling and
grammar:

•spelling checking software

•spelling correction software

•reference dictionaries (including

language conversion) and thesauruses.

The following can be useful for those with
auditory and visual impairment or processing
deficits:

•text-to-speech (auditory feedback)

•Rapid Serial Visual Presentation

(RSVP) (where each letter of a word is

briefly shown in sequence).

The following can be useful for those with
concentration (including tiredness and fatigue)
or attention difficulties:

•multimedia electronic documents

•text-to-speech (auditory feedback)

•RSVP (as above).

The following can be useful for those with
difficulty in multitasking and physical
coordination or dexterity:

•remote computer control

•remote environmental control (through
the use of an infra-red controller).



5. Reflections on the results of the
project

The accessibility of a PDA can be viewed from
two perspectives:

•The accessibility and usability of the PDA
device

A person with a severe visual impairment may
find it difficult to read the comparatively small
text on a PDA display and may find the
information it presents inaccessible thus making
the device unusable in its original form.

•The use of a PDA as an assistive
technology

A person with a time management and
organisational difficulty might benefit from the
diary   and calendar functions of most PDAs
which would thus provide functional technology
assistance to someone with a disability.

These two possible strands of a PDA’s
functionality are not mutually exclusive since it is
necessary that a PDA is functionally accessible
to   be of use as an assistive technology.

Neither the manufacturers nor the developers of
PDA handhelds, operating systems and their
software have generally considered the
accessibility of their products. The development
of PDAs has been so fast since their evolution
beyond personal information management (PIM)
systems that little analysis has been made of
their functionality for people with disabilities.

Though much progress has been made on the
accessibility of desktop computers with
increasing amounts of assistive technology, the
swift development of new PDA models has
meant that little has been learnt from
retrospective analysis. However, one notable
advancement in the usability of a PDA is the
implementation of a Jog thumb dial by Sony and
Franklin eBookman on the side of their
handhelds.

5.1.  Evaluation of the way PDAs are
currently used

PDAs have the potential to provide a portable,
flexible platform for personal information
management, computing support and access to
electronic materials.

However, when assessing the usability of a PDA
the user should be quick to realise that it is not a
laptop. Attempting to use one as a primary
computing tool would soon result in frustration
and inefficiency in both time and effort. For

example, trying to use a PDA for the post-
production stages (spell-checking, large-scale
word processing and publication design) of a
publication would be most efficiently carried out
on   a desktop computer. For a PDA to be used
to its full potential the user must have regular
access to a host computer (whether personal or
networked) on which to conduct
synchronisation   for backing up data and so on.

For people who already own PDAs or are
considering purchasing one, the huge variety of
PDA models and software can be confusing.

There are thousands of applications available in
hundreds of permutations of combinations and
additions. This means that general users are
not aware of the range of software (and
hardware) available that might make a PDA
more accessible or aid their functional
difficulties.

The use of a PDA as an assistive technology
has barely been explored in the mainstream
educational sector. Expertise related to the
suitability of operating systems and relevant
software with accessibility features within the
educational or supplier infrastructure does not
at present exist, although TechDis is working
with many parties to improve this situation.

‘There are very limited examples of PDA use in
the further and higher education sectors [within
the UK]. Projects have begun at five FE
colleges and three universities’ (Smith 2003).
However the long-term effectiveness of PDAs in
education has not been assessed.

Under the Special Educational Needs and
Disability Act (SENDA) consideration has to be
given to students with disabilities. However, the
project team felt that the lack of knowledge on
this subject within the community meant that
they would not have been able to deal
successfully with this issue in anticipation of a
student’s arrival.

5.2.  What have we learnt? (Transferable
knowledge)

In the process of the project we have learned a
great deal about issues surrounding the use of
PDAs that is not included in this paper, eg the
usability and accessibility of electronic material
and specifically design for presentation on a
PDA (ie PDA-friendly materials)

The rationale behind the assessment process
(for providing students with technology) needs
to match the person to the PDA, by considering:


•hardware and software related to their
functional needs

•the large range of PDA software and the
limitations of each platform

•how a PDA could be integrated into a
course curriculum or educational

environment

•the specific features of software for the
PDA platforms that lead to increased or

decreases accessibility and usability.

5.3.  A brief glance into the future

PDAs could be used as an assistive technology
in the following ways.

•Peripheral cameras could be adapted to
work as portable close-circuit televisions

(CCTVs) using the PDA displays.

•Wireless PDAs could be used to provide
simultaneous text transcription and

presentation for users with a hearing
impairment (or otherwise).

•Speech recognition could be used for
personal note-taking and other writing

tasks and not just for memos.

•Handheld optical character recognition
(OCR) scanning could be done without

the use of a third-party device.

Abstract

We  describe  a  learning  organiser  for
handheld computers that has been trialled with
university students. The aim was to investigate
whether an integrated set of learning tools would
be useful, which tools would be adopted and the
contexts in which the tools would be used. The
results show no single favoured application. The
most frequent activities were reading e-mail,
note- taking,  managing  deadlines  and
appointments, and listening to music. The main
reported limitation, apart from battery life, weight
and processor speed, was the loss of wireless
LAN connectivity, and thus usefulness, outside
the  university  department.  A  comparative
evaluation was also carried out between one of
the learning organiser tools, a star-structured
concept map, and a more traditional, free-format
concept map. The results suggest that different
concept-mapping tools may be suited to different
tasks and types of user.

1. Introduction

Mobile  office  organisers  are  becoming
indispensable tools for many professionals.
They provide a suite of work support tools,
including a calendar, address book, notebook
and to-do list on a handheld computer. Some
devices, such as the Blackberry, also allow
people to read and send e-mail and to read and
update a shared calendar. The value of these

tools has been demonstrated through their
widespread adoption; some companies now
provide  their  entire  workforce  with  mobile
organisers.

Learners at university, college or school
have as broad a range of demands for self-
organisation  as  professionals,  but  their
requirements are somewhat different: to attend
classes, meet course deadlines, read and
understand teaching material, revise for exams,
and manage individual and group projects.

This paper describes a project to evaluate a
learning organiser for university students (for
details of the design and implementation, see
Holme and Sharples 2002). The software runs
on  Pocket  PC  handheld  computers  and
provides a set of tools for students to access
course  material,  view  their  timetables,
communicate via e-mail and instant messaging,
and organise ideas and notes. The aim is to
investigate whether students benefit from an
integrated learning organiser and also to find
out what other tools or services for handheld
computers they choose to adopt. Thus, the
main questions are as follows.

•  Is an integrated learning organiser of
value to university students?

•  If so, what tools and services should it
include?

The paper also reports a comparison of one
of the learning organiser tools, the concept
map, with a more free-format concept-mapping
tool, to see which would be more appropriate
for  note-taking  and  topic  browsing  on  a
handheld device.



2. Design

The design aim of the learning organiser was
to develop tools for handheld computers that
might assist students to learn and manage their
studies and to integrate these into a single
software application. The four tools that were
chosen  for  development  were  the  Time
Manager, Course Reader, Communication
Centre, and Concept Mapper, since these span
the range of student study and management
activities. There was no principled reason for
implementing these rather than other potentially
useful tools, such as project management and
groupwork aids, but rather the constraints of
producing tools relevant to student study in the
time available for the project.

Students are expected to take responsibility
for their own study and time management.
Lecture patterns can vary from week to week,
and student assignments and projects may last
for a month or more, with a series of personal
milestones and external deadlines. The Time
Manager (Figure 1) was designed to show at a
glance the structure of the teaching day, with
nine hour-long periods. A ‘time strip’ with boxes
that are either green (free time), yellow
(recurring sessions) or red (single event) is
shown at the top of the Time Manager, and also
on the main startup screen. A Deadlines tab
displays a set of pending deadlines and tasks. A
separate application enables a lecturer to
publish a course timetable and deadlines on the
university intranet, which students can download
and then extend with their own events and
tasks. The Time Manager is implemented to
exchange data automatically with the PocketPC
calendar and task applications, so that students
can synchronise it with standard desktop
calendar and task tools.

Figure 1 Screenshot of the Time Manager

The Course Manager (Figure 2) provides a
portal to teaching materials for the entire course
and for individual modules. The students can
download course materials onto their handheld
computer, and can also access supplementary
materials through weblinks, with the materials
loaded via the wireless LAN connection. The
teaching  materials  can  be  displayed  in  a
PocketPC web browser, or in Microsoft Reader,
Adobe  Acrobat  or  Powerpoint  format,
depending on the type of document. The aim
was not to substitute for printed or web-based
teaching materials, but to provide a single store
of materials for the course available to view on
the handheld computer. For example, a student
might browse the slides before a lecture, or
quickly review a troublesome topic.

Figure 2: Screenshot of the Course Manager

The  Communication  Centre  gives  an
interface to run the standard Pocket PC e-mail,
instant  messaging  and  contact  tools.  The
wireless LAN connectivity allows students to
browse e-mail, or to check which students are
online with Instant Messenger then hold a text
chat session.

Concept  mapping,  also  known  as  topic
mapping or mind mapping, has been developed
over the past 30 years as a tool for learning.
Students are able to learn effectively from
course material presented as visual concept
maps  showing  a  network  of  nodes
(representing topics or concepts) and labelled
or unlabelled links (representing conceptual
associations between the topics (see Fisher
2002, for an overview). The process of creating
concept maps can also encourage students to
reflect and understand. A series of studies have
shown that students who were taught concept-
mapping techniques for studying in lectures or
from printed text performed better than those
who used traditional note-taking, in identifying
main ideas, recalling relations between ideas,



and describing underlying mechanisms (Fisher
2002). There is evidence that computer concept-
mapping tools for desktop computers, such as
SemNet®, can aid studying and notetaking
(Gorodetsky and Fisher 1996), but this has not
been tested for handheld devices. Map-It! was
developed by Chan as a concept-mapping tool
for small-screen devices, with a simple point-
and-click interface to browse through related
nodes. This was incorporated into the learning
organiser. During the trials another concept
mapping tool for Pocket PC computers, but with
a very different interface, became available,
developed as part of PhD research by Rudman.
A small-scale comparison of the two tools was
carried out.

3. Equipment and software

Seventeen students taking an MSc in human-
centred systems at the University of Birmingham
were loaned an iPAQ handheld computer with a
wireless LAN sleeve and docking cradle. The
sleeve provides high-speed access to web
pages, course material and e-mail within the
university  department.  The  docking  cradle
enables those students with computers at home
to  synchronise  their  calendar,  notes  and
documents, and to transfer software.

Students were provided with three types of
software:

were using the iPAQ at least once a day. This
fell to 42% (6 out of 14) after 16 weeks (one
student had left the course and two did not
complete the questionnaire).

4.2. Results

There was no single favoured application.
The activities most frequently reported in the
questionnaire  were  e-mailing,  note-taking,
managing appointments and deadlines, and
listening to music. The diary reports also
showed web browsing and reading (course
notes and e-books) as frequent activities.

Table 1 shows the reported usefulness of the
main learning organiser tools, with the first
figures being the percentage and actual
numbers of students reporting ‘useful’ or ‘very
useful’ after four weeks (n=17), and the second,
the percentage and number after 16 weeks
(n=14).

use and entertainment.

4. Evaluation: learning organiser

4.1. Method

Students completed detailed questionnaires
about their iPAQ use after four and 16 weeks.
They were also asked to keep logbooks
recording each use of the iPAQ, their activity,
the time spent on the task and the tools they
employed. After four weeks, 64% (11 out of 17)

Table 1 Perceived usefulness of tools (‘useful’
or ‘very useful’) after 4 weeks (n=17) and 16
weeks (n=14).

4.3. Discussion

It  was  not  possible  to  measure
improvements in time management and study
habits  directly  (though  a  more  extensive
investigation may be able to do so, for example
by a comparison of study patterns and missed
deadlines), so the findings were based on a
combination of surveys, interviews, and diary
studies.

The results show that e-mail, timetable and
web  browser  retained  or  increased  their
perceived  usefulness,  while  the  instant
messaging, teaching materials and concept
mapper were judged to be less useful in the
later survey. There are a number of possible



explanations for this: the novelty of some tools
may have worn off while others continued to be
useful, or the students’ pattern of study may
have changed (the MSc is run with week-long
intensive modules, so the students would have
been studying different modules at each of the
interviews).

The main reported limitation, apart from
battery life, weight, and processor speed, was
the loss of connectivity, and thus usefulness,
outside the department.

5. Comparison: concept-mapping
tools

Given the low use and perceived usefulness
of the concept-mapping tool, it was decided to
carry out a comparison between Map-It! (which
was provided as part of the learning organiser)
and  another  concept-mapping  tool  also
developed at the University of Birmingham:
Concise Concept Mapper (CCM). While both
mapping tools described here are optimised for
pen-based interactions on a small screen, they
operate significantly differently.

HandLeR Map-It! (Chan and Sharples 2002)
(Figure 3) uses a star structure in which one
node is central and has linked surrounding
nodes. To navigate, the user clicks on one of the
outer nodes, which brings it to the centre,
displaying the topics related to it. Clicking on the
centre node displays any document associated
with that node. The user can add a new node by
selecting a document from the file list, which
attaches it to the central node.

Figure 3 Screenshot of HandLeR Map-It!

Concise Concept Mapper (CCM) (Figure
4) provides a free-form concept map based on
user-positioned nodes and links (Rudman et al.
2002). Interaction is by pen gestures: a node is
moved around the map by simply dragging it
with the pen, scrolling the map as necessary (by

dragging into the eight ‘arrows’). Nodes may
also be grouped for dragging. To add a new
node at an unoccupied place on the map the
user taps at that place, opening an input area
for the node's text. Nodes may subsequently be
linked by dragging one node on top of the other.

Figure 4 Screenshot of Concise Concept
Mapper (CCM)

Figure 5 Screenshot of CCM showing the
compressed view

A zoom facility displays a compressed
version of the entire map, giving an overview of
its structure (Figure 5). This is designed to
reduce usability problems inherent in working
on small pieces of the map by separating the
map structure from its details. Search text may
also be input to highlight nodes containing
specific words.

5.1. Method

A qualitative comparison was undertaken.
Three MSc student volunteers were asked first
to familiarise themselves with both software
tools and to read some general information on
using concept maps. The comparison then
proceeded as follows:

(1a) Participants were given 15 minutes to
create a concept map based on a familiar



document from their MSc course (once for
each  software  tool  using  different
documents).

(1b) Participants were given a ready-made
concept map (about the geography and
history of Guatemala and Puerto Rico –
countries they were not familiar with) and
were given 15 minutes to answer five
questions, using only the concept map for
reference (again once per tool using
different maps).

(2)  A few days later the participants were
shown  a  video  recording  of  their
participation in 1b and asked to recall and
describe their thoughts from that time.

5.2. Results

(1)  CCM generally performed better than Map
It! during note-taking because of the
flexibility of placing text directly on the map
without first creating a document or
defining its relationship to other concepts.

(2)  More correct answers were obtained using
Map-It! (scores of 4, 4 and 5, out of 5) than
CCM (scores of 3, 2 and 4). Participants
suggested that Map-It! would be more
suitable for presentation purposes, such as
tutors providing notes, due to its imposed
structure.

(3)  Most participants (2 out of 3) were able to
answer all of the questions in a shorter time
using Map-It! than CCM at stage 1b.

(4)  All participants suggested that at stage 1b.
Map-It! appeared to have significantly less
text than CCM. (In fact the amount of text
on both software tools was similar.)

Participants also mentioned the importance
of meaningful keywords on the maps, allowing
them to predict what information lay beneath the
node. Participants cited this as allowing them to
answer questions more easily and quickly with
Map-It! than with CCM. The requirement to
condense the concept (or document) into a few
words on the map imposed by Map-It! was the
main reason for quicker navigation with this tool
and why Map-It! appeared to have significantly
less text.

All the participants welcomed the search
facility on CCM. Although during the experiment
the lack of search in Map-It! did not greatly
hinder the participants in completing their tasks,
the participants suggested that it is also

important  to  provide  search  on  Map-It!
particularly for a larger concept map (more than
three levels deep).

5.3. Discussion

Results suggest that each tool performed
best in different situations. CCM performs better
for note-taking and organising information with
no obvious structure; it is also more suited to
experienced users. On the other hand, Map-It!
is  better  at  presenting  highly  structured
information  and  organising  documents  by
semantic relations; it is also more suitable for
novice or occasional users.

Analysis  of  the  concept  maps  the
participants created during the early part of the
experiment and their later interviews indicated
that the lack of experience in creating concept
maps is a major factor behind the low usage.

Reflecting

Learning

Figure 6 Learning facilitation

We conclude that combining the strengths of
the two concept-mapping tools could further
facilitate learning (Figure 6). The process of
using notes from CCM to construct a map in
Map-It! could be considered as a reflecting
process as the user will be organising concepts
and structures within their notes. On the other
hand when using Map-It! as a delivery method,
the process of taking notes from the concept
map into CCM could be an aid to learning.

6. General discussion

Students  have  always  needed  help  to
develop effective study skills, but the new
trends in university teaching make this even
more of an imperative. Worsening staff–student
ratios  may  mean  that  students  have  less
guidance from tutors. The change in teaching
patterns away from lectures, seminars and lab
classes towards resource-based learning and
flexible  study  mean  that  students  have  to
manage  a  more  complex  set  of  learning



resources  and  patterns  of  teaching  and
assessment. The development of part-time,
online and distance learning puts yet more
burden on students to organise their limited time
without the structure of a traditional full-time
course.

The premise of the study reported here is that
if students have a personal organiser and
communicator ready at hand, with appropriate
study tools and resources, then they will become
more effective in managing their time and study
habits. The results are mixed.

The  continued  popularity  of  e-mail  and
timetable, despite these also being available on
desktop machines, suggests the importance of
mobile organisation and communication tools to
enable students to manage their learning. The
consistent use of the web browser also shows
the potential utility of integrated tools. Although
fewer students continued to use the other tools,
some students were still finding them useful.

There was no single benefit or best tool.
Instead the students appeared to employ the
technology to suit their needs, with some using it
primarily as a communications device while
others made more use of the ability to browse
learning materials or manage their calendar.
This suggests that provision of an adaptable or
even  an  adaptive  version  of  the  learning
organiser  is  worth  investigating.  Indeed,  in
addition to differences in tool use, the logbooks
showed that locations of use differed quite
widely  across  users,  and  the  relationship
between tool and location also differed (Bull
2003). This further supports the proposal of
implementing an adaptive version of the learning
organiser in order to meet the individual needs
of different students. Based on these results,
work on such an adaptive system is now under
way.

It is not clear that students want or need an
integrated learning organiser, separate from the
standard calendar, address book or task list
applications. Instead, it may be better to provide
views on the standard tools, such as being able
to view the course timetable within the calendar,
and have assessment deadlines added to the
task list. Further tools may be useful, such as a
project manager for group projects and an
electronic student logbook. We are currently
investigating  the  design  of  such  tools  and
services, for handheld devices and for pen tablet
computers.

The most telling finding was the disruption
that some students experienced when they left

the  Wireless  LAN  range  and  lost
communication. Students learn and organise
their studies across many locations and times,
so for a learning organiser to be truly effective
all its tools and services must be available
anytime, anywhere.

Abstract

Mobile learning encompasses a range of
technologies, to the extent that mobile learning
and e-learning are now referred to as ‘networked
learning’ in some quarters. It is increasingly
likely  that  this  involves  the  deployment  of
reusable learning objects. There is a risk that as
such objects are converted or modified for use in
different  mobile  environments,  some  of  the
pedagogy may get ‘lost’ in the process. Thus we
need to consider how to design and deliver
effective mobile learning in a scalable manner,
to a multiplicity of technologies. This paper
considers  how  Bloom’s  (1976)  cognitive
taxonomy of learning and Ma et al.’s (2000)
framework  for  adaptive  content  delivery  in
heterogeneous network environments can be
used in this context, and points to standards and
the need for effective metadata to consolidate
these factors.

Keywords: learning objects, mobile learning,

1. Introduction

There has recently been significant growth in
the number of initiatives that are using mobile
devices to support teaching and learning, and an
increasing amount of interest in this from many
sectors. As with other emerging research and
development areas of educational technology, a

key issue of concern for interested parties is
how we can ‘scale up’ relatively small-scale
projects into ones which can be used in a wider
context.  Those  already  involved  in  mobile
learning projects are aware of a number of
issues which act as constraints for developing
mobile  learning  applications,  and  it  is
reasonable to assume that many of those
interested  in  mobile  learning  have  some
experience with e-learning. In the e-learning
community there is a great deal of interest in
the notion of reusable learning objects; as more
of these are developed and become available
for reuse, it is reasonable to assume that some
intended areas of reuse will include mobile
learning.

Although  there  is  potential  for  mobile
learning platforms to use e-learning resources
by optimising them for the network and delivery
platforms, we are concerned that this should
not be done at the risk of losing the pedagogy
designed into the original learning object. This
paper attempts to draw together these issues
by raising some considerations which may
allow those involved in e-learning and mobile
learning to maximise the potential for effective
reuse of e-learning resources in mobile learning
environments; that is ensuring that pedagogic
benefits are retained or at least that users are
aware of how they may change from intended
and expected values.



This paper begins by considering what is
meant  by  mobile  learning  at  present,  and
illustrating the current diversity of technologies
that exist in this area. I then consider how e-
learning, constructivism, and critiques of the
notion of ‘learning objects’ relate to mobile
learning. Bloom's taxonomy of learning (1976) is
considered in a mobile learning context; then I
examine  a  framework  that  can  enable  the
transformation of learning objects in terms of
how it could affect their pedagogic efficacy when
transformed  for  mobile  learning  usage.  I
conclude  by  identifying  relevant  emerging
international standards and initiatives that may
facilitate the reuse of learning objects to mobile
learning environments.

2.  What do we mean by mobile
learning?

Mobile learning is a relatively new concept,
and is closely related to e-learning. Milrad
(2003) defines e-learning as ‘learning supported
by digital “electronic” tools and media’, and
mobile learning as ‘e-learning using mobile
devices and wireless transmission’. Both these
terms encompass a wide variety of technologies
and initiatives, which is indicative of the state of
the  art  in  these  fields.  Polsani (2003a)
expresses concern with the use of these terms,
believing they ‘are too restrictive to adequately
characterise the new forms of learning because
they  refer either to the delivery format of
content… or the access devices… (both terms)
came to be thought as instances of traditional
distance learning’. To remedy this, Polsani
argues that the term ‘network learning’ (or ‘n-
learning’) would be more appropriate and
proposes that it can be defined as ‘a form of
education whose site of production, circulation,
and consumption is the network’.

In this paper, my interest lies in what is
produced,  circulated  and  consumed  in  the
network, to facilitate the education process.
There  are  a  number  of  activities  that  are
considered to be within the realm of mobile
learning at present and they involve the use of a
range of mobile devices, using a number of
different mobile network technologies.

Consideration:  mobile  learning  can  be
thought of as a special type of e-learning, bound
by a number of special properties (eg form
factor,  which  is  the  size  and  physical
arrangement  and  configuration)  and  the
capability  of  devices,  bandwidth  and  other
characteristics of the network technologies being
used, etc.

There have been initiatives using SMS (text
messaging): for example, revision support in
secondary schools in Merseyside (Ananova
2001). At Kingston University, we are about to
begin trials using SMS alerts to support first-
year degree students and provide ‘scaffolding’,
that is learning supports (eg Soloway et al.
1996),  in  terms  of  time  management  and
ensuring that essential core learning is not
missed  at  an  early  stage,  building  upon
previous research (Stone et al. 2002).

Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) has
been  used  in  some  cases  to  support
postgraduate learners (see Noone 2001; Turner
2001). WML (Wireless Mark-up Language),
which renders content on mobile telephones
usable, has been useful in developing content
using the ‘stack of cards’ model, such as
Apple’s Hypercard (Giguère 2000). WML is not
restricted to the WAP network protocol: for
example, one could use GPRS (General Packet
Radio Service) to make the connection, and
receive WML pages. As more handsets are
capable  of  both  WAP  and  GPRS,  the
distinctions become increasingly blurred from a
user's point of view. Location-based services
(LBS) are also being implemented using
various network technologies, with varying
degrees of accuracy, and thus degrees of
sophistication, depending on the technologies
in     use.

It should be noted that the use of mobile
phones in education has mainly taken place in
Europe and Asia. In North America, mobile
learning more commonly denotes the use of
handheld computers, personal digital assistants
(PDAs), and so on, linked across wireless
networks such as 802.11, rather than mobile
phones (eg Wired 2002; Palm 2001). However,
there are also cases where PDAs have been
used in the UK and Europe to support mobile
learning (eg Taylor et al. 2002; Collett and
Stead 2002; Pinkwart et al. 2002).

Third-generation mobile telephony (3G) has
now arrived in the UK, with the new mobile
operator ‘3’ the first to offer handsets and
services to the mass market (eg 3 2003). The
current focus of applications is on mass-market
audiences, with sport and entertainment being
the main sectors marketed to prospective
customers. However, the network and handsets
offer  the potential of high-speed data rates and
the potential to offer streaming media in
addition to large file transfers where needed.



From a modest selection of examples, it is
apparent that mobile learning is a very broad
spectrum at present, and so presents another
consideration for educational technologists.

Consideration:  mobile  learning  is  a
heterogeneous environment; it encompasses a
range of devices and network technologies

With these two considerations in mind, this
paper considers two key aspects of e-learning
that may be pre-requisites for its success, before
looking at what in particular may be needed to
make mobile learning successful.

3. Two key facets of e-learning:
constructivism and learning objects

One  of  the  most  important  planks
underpinning much of e-learning theory and
practice  is  pedagogic  theory  based  on
constructivism and social constructivism. Milrad
(2003) states ‘constructivism is at the core of the
movement to shift the centre of instruction away
from delivery in order to allow the learner to
actively direct and choose a personal learning
path’ (page 153). Social constructivism reflects
the  social  nature  of  knowledge  formation
through personal experiences and collaborations
which  ‘involve  not  just  the  exchange  of
information, but the design and construction of
meaningful artefacts’. Both social constructivism
and constructivism require active learning on the
part of the individual, with the teacher focusing
on missing connections.

However, the provision of technology and
pedagogic theory also requires the production
and  provision  of  good-quality  educational
content  to  enable  successful  networked
learning. Although the networked aspect can be
a key element of facilitating the learning process
among students, this is insufficient without the
content to back up and stimulate constructivist
behaviour.

Content used in e-learning is increasingly
being reused in ways it was not initially created
for. There is a growing movement towards
developing digital educational content as
‘learning objects’ intended for reuse from the
outset. Rather than considering the major
standards and initiatives relating to reusable
learning objects, recent critical work in this area
can assist forming our considerations for
developing effective reusable mobile learning
content. The reader unfamiliar with current
standards and initiatives can find these cited in
the reference section of this paper.

Current definitions of learning objects are
critiqued by Polsani (2003b), who believes they
are ‘confusing and arbitrary’. He proposes a
definition  of  a  learning  object  as  ‘an
independent and self-standing unit of learning
content that is predisposed to reuse in multiple
instructional contexts’. Friesen (2003) raises a
number of criticisms in relation to learning
objects:  contending  ‘specifications  and
applications  that  are  pedagogically  neutral
cannot also be pedagogically relevant’. He also
questions the variety of definitions of learning
objects, believing ‘in order for the positive
potential of learning objects to be realised, they
need to be labelled, described, investigated and
understood in ways that make the simplicity,
compatibility and advantages claimed for them
readily apparent’.

Links between constructivism and learning
objects tend to be implicit in the literature, yet
while Hodgins (2000) criticises the notion of a
fully automated process which views the
combination and use of learning objects in
‘Lego™-like’ fashion, he concedes there is
potential in ‘the student-directed constructivist
use of small learning objects’.

Currin (2001) noted that the Nortel Networks’
training provider developed mobile e-learning
which uses what they referred to as ‘learning
nuggets … bite-sized chunks of information
pertinent to specific tasks such as system
specifications and installation procedures’.
Although corporate training material should not
be considered as identical to constructivist
learning models in further and higher education,
this is one of the first concrete examples of the
integration of a learning object-based approach
combined with mobile delivery.

Darby (2002) notes that the approach taken
by  Oxford  University  differs  from  the
mainstream. While the latter considers learning
objects to be potentially stand-alone objects
and mini-courses in their own right, Oxford,
under  the  Technology  Assisted  Lifelong
Learning  (TALL)  programme,  has  viewed
learning objects as components that define a
learning activity, each designed to achieve a
specific learning outcome. Darby refers to these
as ‘very small-scale learning objects’, which are
combined  into  a  structured  learning
environment,  with  core  ‘spinal’  documents
giving  context  to  the  content  and  activity
elements. He asserts in this case that the
learning objects may not have any intrinsic
learning value, except when combined with
other learning objects.



Consideration: e-learning is likely to be more
effective when high-quality content is being
used.

Table 1. Networked learning activities in
relation to Bloom’s taxonomy of learning


Consideration: criticisms of the learning
object world-view need to be considered;
context must be borne in mind at all times.

In the light of the critical literature, we must
accept that key to a successful ‘learning object
economy’ is the notion of effective reuse of such
objects, and that we have to accept that at least
some of this reuse is likely to take place in a
different context from its original use. There may
be differences in the course in which it is used;
how it is used as an educational resource; what
platform it is deployed on; and so on. We
therefore need to consider what factors can help
make mobile learning more successful.

4.  What  makes  mobile  learning
successful?

The notion of ‘successful’ mobile learning is
intentionally provocative – as the technologies
and applications are still very new, exemplars of
best practice are still emerging, and we suggest
that it may be instructive to consider how various
types of learning can be structured in terms of
levels of sophistication, and how current thinking
is being modified to consider how we can move
towards  ensuring  more  successful  mobile

learning. Bloom's taxonomy of learning (Bloom
1976)  identified  three  domains  of  learning
activities: cognitive, affective and psychomotor.
The cognitive domain can be used to illustrate
how  networked  learning  activities  (both  e-
learning  and  mobile  learning)  may  be
categorised in terms of degrees of sophistication
(see Table 1).

Irrespective of which levels of learning are

addressed, mobile learning applications will, by
definition, be bound by a set of constraints.
These will have implications on how learning
objects can be (re)used most effectively.

5.  What are the constraints facing
effective mobile learning – particularly
the reuse of learning objects?

The first set of constraints is that imposed by
the network: different network technologies
have different maximum potential amounts of
bandwidth available to their users; however,
there is also no guarantee that such maxima
will be available to all users, at all times. Also,
there may be differences between the width of
the ‘data pipe’ available in each direction; ie it
may be possible to download some information
much more quickly than for someone to upload
the same amount.

Second, the form factor of mobile devices
presents constraints: mobile devices, by their
nature, tend to be engineered with the key
requirement that the actual device is small, and



the displays are increasingly large. However,
display sizes and resolutions still differ widely,
and unless one is working in an environment
where all students have been provided with
identical devices, it may be difficult to make
assumptions regarding what students can and
cannot do, and how easy it may be for them to
perform certain actions. There is an analogy
here with the early days of the worldwide web,
as original HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
specification did not take into account the use of
graphics, sound, rich interactions or proprietary
extensions for the different browsers. A similar
phenomenon  has  been  observed  with  the
adoption of Java device-specific extensions by
application developers (eg BBC 2002).

Finally, and perhaps of most importance to
mobile learning, a third constraint arises as an
emergent property through consideration of the
previous two, relating to the pedagogic efficacy
of  content  reused  in  a  mobile  learning
environment: ie ‘does the learning object “work"
on this device – does learning take place?’. The
two  constraints  above  have  quite  profound
design  implications  for  those  interested  in
working  towards  scalable,  effective  mobile
learning for as wide a community as possible, if
we are considering a world in which multiple
technologies coexist. As in the more general
discussion regarding learning objects in Section

3  (and,  we  would  argue,  of  even  greater
importance here), we need a framework to
ensure effective reuse, ie that not only can
content be delivered in a meaningful way, but
the pedagogy underpinning its creation and
deployment is still there!

It could be argued that the loss of pedagogic
efficacy is inevitable as a result of repurposing,
but notions of complementary media and
complexity  support  a  case  for  trialling,
documenting lessons learned, and usage of this
being archived as metadata to support reuse
(Stone et al. 2002). However, as stated earlier,
the potential for variable delivery quality may
detract from this, ie the user experience,
affected  by  issues  relating  to  technical
constraints, is another factor which must be
taken  into account.

Consideration: technical constraints that may
affect the mobile learning experience need to be
taken into account.

A framework exists which addresses this for
heterogeneous network environments in general

– this can be used as a starting point to address
the consideration above. We shall now consider
the adaptive content delivery framework of Ma et

al. and consider how these points can be
applied to mobile learning as a special case.

6.  Adaptive content delivery
framework – some extensions for
mobile learning reuse of learning
objects

Ma et al. (2000) present a framework for
adaptive content delivery in heterogeneous
network environments – a roadmap to manage
technical issues. This framework presents five
categories of what they call ‘content adaptation
techniques’ (CATs). I shall now consider each
of these categories in the light of how they
could be used to extend this framework for the
delivery of learning objects in a mobile learning
context.

6.1.CAT 1: information abstraction

This allows a ‘preview’ of content to be
generated and optimised for the device. At
certain levels of teaching, learners may not be
aware of all the factors relating to why a
learning object is ‘useful’ for them: ie the wider
and deeper learning outcomes relating to a
continuous learning strategy; and how the
learning object maps to these, particularly in
relation to a constructivist approach. Some
parts of the activity may be key to the individual
experience which the teacher will then facilitate
reflection on, as part of the learning process.
Information abstraction therefore needs to be
undertaken by the learning providers and can
then reside in the decision engine (defined in
Section 6.6).

6.2.CAT 2: modality transform

Examples of this include transforming a
video stream to sets of images, subtitles as key
text, use of audio track, etc. Authors and
teachers implementing the learning object may
wish to prioritise this in terms of pedagogic
utility. It could be argued that some value is
better than none, although we also need to take
into  consideration  learners'  use  of
complementary media, which may differ from
expected use. This may increase the aggregate
utility of the learning objects delivered, even in
a transformed manner (Stone et al. 2002).

6.3.CAT 3: purpose classification

In an education environment, classification of
purpose should include learning outcomes –
this is overlooked in the model of Ma et al.
model. These may vary according to context of



(re)use, and as such must be stored and made
available for the decision engine. This does not
prevent multiple entries being made according to
set contexts of use (ie different level of use than
originally intended, but context and usefulness
recorded, eg as a pointer to information relating
to this) and could be achieved with multiple
entries in an appropriate metadata record (eg an
IMS Learning Resource tag – see IMS 2003),
with each entry having an identification tag
about context of use, reflections on that use.
This  could  be  expressed  in  an  Resource
Definition Framework, for example.

6.4. CAT 4: data prioritisation

This refers to the prioritisation of converting
data through utilising the available network
bandwidth. In Section 5, we noted that this is
(and  will continue to be) an issue, from variable
reception on handsets, to the potential of
available (and, very likely, affordable) bandwidth
which may vary in different ‘hot spots’ in 3G
networks. This may also occur with handsets
capable of switching between different network
technologies and protocol, which may affect
quality  of service parameters over the usage
session. For example, some of the current
handsets that are marketed as ‘3G’ are actually
capable of transferring between GPRS and 3G
technologies, depending on network coverage.

6.5. CAT 5: data transcoding

In  contrast  to  data  prioritisation,  data
transcoding relates to the process of converting
data according to the capability of the client
device. However, there is the suggestion of loss
of detail in video, for example, which could mean
that  detail  which  is  crucial  to  the  learning
objectives designed into the learning object get
‘lost’. This could be protected by metadata
prioritising a key level of quality, eg in video
showing  a  technique  for  undertaking  a
procedure, a certain minimum acceptable level
of resolution, frame rate, and so on. Where
certain factors are regarded as essential for the
learning object to have any pedagogic ‘worth’,
we suggest that alternatives, which can be
rendered as part of a modality transform (6.2),
are provided by those responsible for providing
the learning object in that context.

6.6. ‘Herding CATs’: decision engine

The above content adaptation techniques
would be mediated by what Ma et al. call a
‘decision engine’, via a three-stage process – I
now consider how this may address the
considerations I have outlined in this paper.

Stage 1 implies that the user may have a say
in the type of modality transform and data
transcoding  techniques.  Minimum  levels
(including lower bandwidth combinations which
preserve the pedagogy) could be indicated in
the learning object’s metadata, which could
then be applied by the decision engine if
transformations need to take place. The user
(or the network) could then indicate a Quality of
Service (QoS) level at which content may be
delivered,  with  a  pre-qualified  degree  of
pedagogic efficacy assured by the learning
provider.

Stage  2  involves  a  trade-off  between
information abstraction and download time,
taking  into  account-processing  time  for
performing information abstraction. Ma et al.
suggest a user input where the quality vs.
response time trade-off may be specified. By
adding appropriate learning object metadata,
this user input could remain, but could be
mediated  by  recommendations  from  the
learning providers as to what is ‘meaningful’
content delivery that delivers the ‘important’
parts for the learner to undertake a learning
experience, which can be supported by the
teacher in the reflective part of the learning
process.

Stage 3 is known as ‘data prioritisation’, with
progressive interactive web delivery (Gilbert
and  Broderson  1999)  suggested  as  an
example. Our main consideration here is that
the playback of the data on the device should
take place without any glitches that may detract
from the learner experience. If there should be
a change in the network quality of service
during the session, the data that is key to the
delivery of an effective learning object could be
delivered, even if it is at a lower quality than
negotiated at the start of the session. However,
while the pedagogic integrity of the learning
content delivered may be intact, if the user has
not  been  informed  this  may  take  place,
expectations  may  be  lowered  which  may
detract from the user experience as a whole.

Ma et al. consider both server and proxy-
based architectures for the above stages; ie
whether  the  server  is  responsible  for
discovering client capabilities and available
bandwidth or whether this is done by a proxy.
Ma   et al. also raise some issues that need to be
considered  in  an  educational  technology
context, namely: author previewing and control
of content adaptation (better on a server, since
the proxy architecture automates the adaptation
process without being mediated, resulting in a



loss  of  control  by  the  author  over  what  is
delivered  to  the  reader)  and  copyright
implications of content delivery. He suggests
that liability may be avoided on a server, as the
content  provider  has  control  over  content
transformation, although notes that on a proxy-
based  architecture  partnering  with  content
providers may circumvent the copyright issue. In
the  UK  education  sector,  agents  such  as
Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN)
subject centres (LTSN 2003), Joint Information
Systems Committee (JISC) hubs (JISC 2003),
and  the  like  may  be  considered  as  such
partnerships,  although  these  agencies  are
exploring ways to address this issue.

7.  Other  relevant  standards  and
initiatives

Work is under way in the development of
proposed standards which can address network
quality of service and device dependency –
composite  capabilities/preferences  profiles
(CC/PP)  and  user  agent  profiles  (UAProf)
respectively (eg Cowen 2002). These will be
essential to underpin the framework Ma et al
have outlined and to facilitate the move from
repurposing learning objects to a variety of
delivery platforms, towards delivering to a client
device that may be able to support a variety of
network technologies on one device (ie fourth
generation  mobile  telephony/beyond  3G
networks, or ‘4G/B3G’).

While a definitive implementation of the Ma et
al. framework may still be some way off, Mark
Butler  of  HP  Labs  has  developed  “DELI”,
described  as  ‘an  open-source  library  that
provides an Application Programming Interface
(API) to allow Java servlets to resolve HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests containing
delivery context information from CC/PP or
UAProf capable devices and query the resolved
profile’ (Butler 2002). A servlet is a program that
runs part of a network service and responds to
requests from clients. This is achieved though
profile  resolution;  with  devices  passing
references to their particular profile (stored on
the server) and any differences to that profile
unique to that client.

Cowen  (2002)  quotes  Roger  Gimson's
observation of a stand-off between the client and
server sides, in terms of making the first move
towards  supporting  exchange  of  device
capabilities,  then  asserts  that  in  a  device
independent world, ‘files will not necessarily look
identical...  on  numerous  devices  and  ...
interfaces, but the content should remain usable
regardless of the interface’. To this end, in order

for the potential for some degree of pedagogic
integrity to be maintained, the profile resolution
mechanism should integrate the considerations
we have outlined in this paper and allow
interaction with other mechanisms that support
the effective resource discovery of learning
object reuse.

8. Conclusion

This paper raises considerations about how
we can design scalable, effective learning that
can be used in networked learning, whether in
the traditional e-learning domain, or in the
rapidly increasing and diverse area of mobile
learning.  Regardless  of  the  specific
technologies in use, networked learning is
underpinned by a constructivist approach
combined with the use of digital content, more
of which is being designed and/or acquired with
reuse in mind. This paper has proposed that
concerns relating to the maintenance of
pedagogic integrity of materials need to be
addressed. Networked learning activities can be
mapped onto the cognitive domain of Bloom’s
taxonomy of learning. Consideration of the
mobile network and device constraints also act
as an influence, particularly when the content in
use may be reused. Frameworks for managing
such issues exist, and can be used to facilitate
the retention of pedagogic ‘worth’ as digital
content is reused across different network
technologies. Such frameworks need to be
integrated with resolution mechanisms such as
that offered by DELI.

Such integration requires a form of ‘glue’ to
facilitate such a process, ie an appropriate
metadata set that can support what I envisage
to be effective reuse. However, there are a
number of issues surrounding the current state
of play regarding the creation and quality of
metadata of digital objects – Currier and Barton
(2003) provide an excellent overview.

Even if these issues are resolved, we also
require a culture and infrastructure that support
the generation and sharing of metadata (as
explored in Callahan et al. 1996), and effective
meta-analysis of learning objects in particular
contexts of use. If this can be implemented, a
knowledge base could be generated which
supports and strengthens a growing set of
instances  of  good  practice,  which  would
maximise  the  potential  for  mobile  learning
across the board.

Abstract

Learning  with  mobile  devices  is  a  highly
fragmented process and this should be taken
into  account  in  designing  as  well  as  in
developing  evaluation  methods  for  mobile
learning  materials  and  environments.
Fragmentation in learning is understood as
when the learning experience does not form a
meaningful continuum because the amount of
incoming  information  and  the  multiplied
communication  sources  make  the  learning
situations  more  distracting.  This  paper
addresses the issue by describing a tentative list
of mobile learning components (m-components),
which   offer  the  means  to  evaluate
fragmentation. The mobile learning components
have  been  operationalised into a self-rating
questionnaire.  The  first  version  of  the
questionnaire was targeted at Finnish primary
school pupils. The questionnaire was validated
with a sample of 68 sixth graders from three
primary schools. The preliminary results are
presented  in  this  paper  along  with
supplementary qualitative data gathered from
teacher interviews and observations on the
sources of fragmentation.

Keywords: mobile learning, fragmentation,
evaluation

1. Introduction

1.1. Aims of the study

Fragmentation in learning is defined in this
article as when the learning experience does not
form  a  meaningful  continuum  because  the
amount of incoming information and the number
of communication sources are increasing which

makes the learning situations more distracting.
The issue of fragmentation has been brought
up in an earlier pilot (Regan 2001), research
paper (Leino et al. 2002) and also in the
interviews with mobile learning experts carried
out  in our project. The aims of this paper are to:

•  understand fragmentation as a typical
phenomenon of mobile learning

•  demonstrate how fragmentation is studied
in our project and how it manifests itself in

classes using different technologies (PCs,
Communicators and laptops)

•  discuss the implications of fragmentation
for the design of mobile learning.

Fragmentation in learning can be seen as an
element affecting transfer. Transfer refers to the
learner’s ability to use previously acquired skills
and knowledge when performing a new task. In
mobile learning the attention distribution in
learning situations where the knowledge is
processed is an important factor in constructing
knowledge into observable learning outcomes.
It can be said that fragmentation has occurred if
the different learning situations do not form a
meaningful  continuum  and  the  acquired
knowledge does not accumulate.

The hypothesis in the primary school pilot
emphasises making learning more meaningful
when  introducing  mobile  devices  in  the
classroom (Jonassen 1995; Leino et al. 2002;
Turunen et al. 2003). The hypothesis has been
presented with the model of mobile learning
components  (m-components).  The  m-
components model has been operationalised in
a mobile learning questionnaire (MLQ). The
questionnaire  includes  measures  of  the
possible effects of fragmentation on learning
experiences and cognitions. The findings of the



preliminary data analysis of these measures will
be presented. Supplementary qualitative data
concerning  the  different  sources  of
fragmentation  in  mobile  learning  has  been
acquired from interviews with teachers and by
observing  the  field  studies  piloting  mobile
learning in two sixth-grade classes and at a
small primary school in Raattama (18 pupils)
that has acted as a remote partner in the
Communicator pilot.

The main research subjects have been 49
11–12-year-old, sixth-grade primary school pupils
who are using mobile devices to communicate
and  working  collaboratively  with pupils  from
different localities. In Pirkkala, a sixth-grade class
(23  pupils)  has  used  two  Nokia  9210
Communicators, a laptop and a digital camera on
their field trips, and processed the materials for
online publication with eight computers in the
computer class. In Hämeenlinna (Normaalikoulu,
wireless future school), a sixth-grade class (26
pupils) has had personal laptops with a General
Pack Radio Service (GPRS) card and Wireless
Local Area Network (WLAN). In addition, a class
using PCs at Turenki (26 pupils) took part in
answering the MLQ.

The findings have provoked discussion on the
production of mobile learning materials as well
as on the questions of usability and accessibility.
Looking  at  our  quantitative  and  qualitative
findings we conclude with some preliminary
guidelines for the design of mobile learning
materials and present future research questions
for studying fragmentation in mobile learning.

1.2. Mobile learning and the challenges
of context

When conceptualising mobility the computer-
supported cooperative work (CSCW) approach
concentrates on depicting mobile technology
and varying information needs in different
situations (Churchill and Wakeford 2002; Luff
and Heath 1998). But does the concept of
mobile learning provide a narrow and technically
defined utopian image of mobile learning based
on  a single characteristic of a mobile device?
Laurier (2002) points out that remarks about
technologies such as cars, mobile phones and
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) – that they
somehow cause work to be faster, more mobile
and  more  connected-up  –  commonly
misinterpret the technologies and their users. It
is forgotten how the management of time and
place concerning the use of the technology is
also joined with people slowing down, staying in
one place and sometimes keeping the network
connection closed.

Sociological  research  on  mobile  use
indicates the growth of flexibility but also of the
micro-level  inefficiency,  for  example  when
meetings are cancelled at the last minute
(Cooper 2001; Kopomaa 2000; Laurier 2002).
An imperative to be within reach all the time has
resulted in different solutions so that people
acquire, for example, separate mobiles for work
and leisure (Kopomaa 2000). In management
Davenport (2001) has paid attention to workers’
opportunities to focus on the right tasks rather
than reacting to instant calls from the workplace
or digital environment. It may be complicated to
construct an environment in which people are
able to combine their learning objectives, get
the work done and live a fulfilling family and
personal life. Therefore the promise to work or
learn regardless of time and place should not
automatically be included in the definition of
mobility or mobile learning.

Mobile learning is often defined as learning
that takes place with the help of mobile devices
(eg Quinn 2000). This does not necessarily
capture the nature of the learning. A device that
supports learning may be freely moved, but in
the learning events the learner is mostly
stationary, even though they are using a mobile
device. Although the device is mobile and
portable, the learning as an event cannot be
described as mobile (Ahonen et al. 2004 ) .
Moreover, when people access information
sources and learning objects via different
devices from different locations, there are still
many usability, compatibility and accessibility-
related questions that hinder seamless mobility
and mobile learning.

Still, our hypothesis has been that as mobile
devices are a pervasive medium, they can help
to combine work, studying and leisure time in a
meaningful  way  (Turunen et  al.  2003).
Therefore, mobile learning should be examined
especially  from  the  viewpoint  of  informal
learning.  According  to  Livingstone  (2000)
informal  learning  can  be  described  as  the
activities  aiming  at  creation  of  knowledge,
understanding, and skills’ acquisition outside
curricula  or  courses.  Incidentally,  initiated
learning, irregularly timed learning, and the
distinction between learning processes and
learning outcomes have all been recognised as
challenges for research concerning informal
learning. In this sense the tools supporting
learning, which possibly are mobile, can help
both  learner  and  teacher  to  perceive  the
observable processes of learning, which can be
difficult to carry out (Ahonen et al. 2004).



According to the initial hypothesis of making
learning  more  meaningful,  bringing  this
pervasiveness to a primary school would enable
continuity between institutional  learning and
learning from real-world phenomena outside
school hours. When the device is a flexible
learning  tool  with  which  people  repeatedly
enhance their knowledge and skills according to
their personal strengths, the goals of lifelong
learning (Sharples 2000, 2002) and life-wide
learning (Drake 1999) can also be achieved.
Here mobile learning requires from the learner
intention, self-discipline, reflection and learning
to  learn.  Together  with  web-based  services
mobile  learning  can  enable  collaborative
learning and access to different information
sources  in  actual  problem-solving  situations
(Jonassen 1995; Sharples 2000; Leino et al.
2002.)  Our  model  (Figure  1)  has  been
developed from the pedagogical point of view
and also takes note of flexible and informal
learning practices (Collis and Moonen 2001).

Fragmentation is an overarching element in
the model, especially in the ‘continuity’ and
‘contextuality’  components.  It  arises  from
distracting learning contexts and has potential
effects on the continuum of long-term learning
process.

2. What is fragmentation?

Regan  (2000)  raised  the  issue  of
fragmentation in her mobile learning pilots.
Mobile  learning  can  be  seen  as  a  highly
fragmented  experience:  on-the-go  learning
situations are often disrupted and take place
unexpectedly, and the focus of attention can
easily be distracted. It can be questionable
whether these on-the-go situations form a strong
basis for meaningful mobile learning (Leino et.
al. 2002).

Figure 1. Mobile learning components

On the other hand, mobile applications may
enhance continuity when ideas need to be
documented. One of the interviewed mobile
learning experts stated: ‘ideas need to be
documented as they emerge – for example
when   the learner is studying in the middle of the
night or a studying group is having a cup of
coffee’.  Nevertheless,  even  in  the  more
consistent  mobile  learning  situations  the
possibility of fragmentation is still present and
the situational and environmental elements
should be considered.

The phenomenon of fragmentation is not
new; it has only been redefined in the era of
information technology. For example it was
covered earlier in ecological psychology and
especially  in  the  time-budget  studies.  The
ecological psychology perspective emphasised
the  wholeness  of  human  functions,  and
stressed the content of the functions and their
temporal  and  spatial  organisation  (Barker
1968). Actual environments have been seen as
having  a  crucial  role  in  psychological
development. To understand the environments
where human beings live requires a theoretical
schema  that  will  permit  the  systematic
description and analysis of these contexts, their
interconnections, and the processes through
which these structures and linkages can affect
the course of development, both directly and
indirectly (Bronfenbrenner 1979). Our approach
to mobile learning is same as in the earlier
studies in ecological psychology where the
actual environment was given emphasis.

According to Cowan (1995) the presence of
attention is a key element both at the time the
preliminary information is processed and at the
time of recall. As disturbing environmental
elements  can  easily  distract  attention  the
metacognitive skills also become important.



Data-driven processing and the formation of
procedural knowledge can often go on to some
extent with little or no attention, although it may
be  susceptible  to  attentional  effects  but
conceptually  driven  processing  and  the
formation of declarative knowledge typically
require considerable attention to occur at all
(Cowan 1995). This means also focusing on the
right learning tasks or the information at hand.
From the educational perspective the key issue
here is: ‘Is it really a fragment or was it just one
element in a sequence within a continuum’, as
another of the interviewed experts in our study
noted. This depends on how the information has
initially  been  processed.  In  this  way  the
fragmentation  encompasses  the  issue  of
transfer.

Salomon  and  Perkins  (1989)  have  made
distinctions between low-road and high-road
transfer. Low-road transfer refers to a type of
transfer that automatically emerges when two
tasks are closely related to each other. High-
road transfer refers to the intentional application
of  previously  acquired  knowledge  in  new
situations. According to Soini (1999) high-road
transfer has usually been the goal of formal
academic education and the skills taught in
school are usually assumed to transfer in a
wide, decontextualised manner. However, in
mobile learning the low-road transfer should be
seen  as  meaningful,  as  it  emphasises  the
informal forms of learning discussed earlier.

The earlier studies of transfer have taken
either the metacognitive or the situational
approach. The metacognitive approach regards
knowledge as an abstract entity residing in
individual cognition acquired in one task setting
and conveyed to other task settings. Therefore
the  metacognitive approach considers the
application of this knowledge (eg learning styles)
in situations that are different from the learning
context as the problem of transfer. The situated
approach  considers  knowledge  as  being
somewhat bound to situations (Brown et al.
1989). Then again the problem of transfer has
been seen in earlier studies as to whether
transfer can occur at all (Soini 1999). However,
the preconditions for transfer in mobile learning
are  both  metacognitive  and  situational.
Therefore, we have taken an eclectic approach
to studying transfer in relation to fragmentation.
Recent discussions (eg Anderson et al. 2000)
have shown convergence of the approaches.

In  a  simplified  manner  fragmentation  in
mobile learning situations can be caused by the
environmental disturbances, poor concentration
of the learner and technical problems, eg bad

network connections, problems with the device
or in the application. Considering fragmentation
in relation to the question of transfer in mobile
learning means investigating in which
conditions fragmentation occurs and how does
it  affect transfer?

3.  Methods for evaluating
fragmentation in mobile learning

The study presented here is part of the
‘Digital Learning 2’ research project. The main
objective  of  the  project  is  to  develop  an
evaluation tool (eValuator) for digital learning
materials and environments. Our mobile group
in the project explores mobile and web-based
learning methods and develops the means to
evaluate them as informal and collaborative
learning. The aim of our studies has been to
support the development of eValuator with the
evolution of the empirically tested criteria that
are  grounded  on  m-components.  (Digital
Learning 2003).

The mobile learning questionnaire was used
in this study to reflect how fragmentation could
be observed in relation to learning styles and
experiences. Supplementary qualitative data
has been acquired in teacher interviews and in
observing the field studies and experiments.
The qualitative data was used to track the
sources of fragmentation according to m-
components and to explain the results of MLQ,
so producing a more complete picture of the
investigated phenomena (Kelle 2001).

3.1. Mobile learning questionnaire

The  mobile  learning  questionnaire  is
constructed in two parts. The first part, in
accordance with mobile learning components,
measures the assumed key competencies in
using mobile devices in learning activities. The
second part measures the learning experiences
of the learners who have used the devices. The
model works as a compilation of key elements
presented in earlier studies of using mobile
devices in learning; both possible strengths and
weaknesses. In the questionnaire these issues
have been operationalised.

MLQ was developed to model learners using
mobile devices and to evaluate their use. It was
based on tests developed earlier and found to
be valid. The phenomenon of fragmentation in
learning  was  pursued  using  a  scaling
instrument  based  on  students’  deep  and
surface approaches to learning developed by
Entwistle and others (Entwistle and Ramsden
1983;  Entwistle  and  Tait  1994)  in  their

approaches to studying inventory (ASI) and the
seven item dualism scale (Ryan 1984; based on
Perry 1970). The approaches to learning scales
and  the  conception  of  knowledge  scale
(dualism) were selected in relation to Cowan´s
(1995) arguments on attention and information
processing. The dualism scale measures the
relativistic  and  contextual  knowledge
orientations of the learners. The dualism refers
to the m-component of contextuality  as  it
measures how context-dependent the learners’
knowledge  concepts  are.  Using  the  deep
approach the learner tries actively to understand
the material, whereas with the surface approach
the learner tries to learn in order to repeat what
they  have  learned.  The  learning  approach
scales refer to the m-component of continuity
and adaptability as the initial processing of the
material, which may have long-term effects on
how the acquired knowledge will be used. The
selected scales thus reflect the preconditions to
transfer  in  which  fragmentation  may  be
manifested.  Scales  to  measure  knowledge
construction, sharing and seeking activities in
relation to using the devices were also created
to capture the effects of possible fragmentation
in learning experiences and to reflect the role of
the metacognitive orientations in the learning
process.

During the spring of 2003 classes at Pirkkala,
Hämeenlinna  and  Turenki  completed  the
questionnaire as it went through its preliminary
testing. At Pirkkala the questions referred to the

use of Communicators, at Hämeenlinna to the
use of laptops and at Turenki to the use of PCs.
Two respondents from the Pirkkala school were
subtracted  from  the  data  because  of
uninterpretable answers. One pupil (at Pirkkala)
did not complete the first part and another pupil
(at Hämeenlinna) did not complete the second
part of the questionnaire. Also four of the pupils
at Hämeenlinna were not present at the time of
completing the questionnaire.

The scales showed fair reliability: deep
approach Cr. alpha = .668, surface approach =

.601 (1 item deleted), dualism = .575 (1 item
deleted), knowledge construction = .680 (1 item
deleted), sharing = .782 and seeking = 682. Z-
transformation was conducted to the variables.
The descriptives for the variables are shown in
the Table 1 above. One sample t-test was used
to find out whether classes’ responses in the
MLQ  were  different  from  the  expected
theoretical population’s means. Analyses of
variance (ANOVA) were used to investigate the
differences between the classes.

One sample t-test revealed that there was a
difference  in  knowledge  sharing  in  class
between pupils who used Communicators and
theoretical population t(20) = -2.39, p < 0.05
This result indicated that the knowledge sharing
in this class was rather unsuccessful. The
difference in knowledge sharing also occurred
with pupils using laptops t(20) = 5.07, p < 0.01.
However this finding indicated being successful



knowledge sharing. The results in knowledge
construction activities t(20) = 2.39 p < 0.05 in the
class using laptops also indicated that the
activities were successful. The pupils using PCs
did not show any difference to the theoretical
population, nor did the pupils using laptops and
Communicators in any of the other variables
measured.

When the surface approach towards learning
was examined, a one-way ANOVA test indicated
that there were significant differences between
classes F(2, 65) = 5,175 p < 0.01. According to
the post-hoc tests (Tukey’s multiple range test)
the pupils using the laptops formed their own
group, and there was no significant difference
between the pupils using Communicators and
PCs. This showed the pupils using laptops had
more of a surface approach to learning than the
other pupils in the other classes.

Also, when the knowledge-sharing activities
was examined, a one-way ANOVA indicated that
there were significant differences among the
classes (see Table 2 below). According to the
post-hoc tests, the pupils using the laptops
formed their own group and there was no
significant difference between the pupils using
Communicators and PCs. A two-way ANOVA
showed  that there was also a significant two-
way interaction of the device used and deep
processing on knowledge sharing activities. The
result showed the pupils who used deeper
approaches to learning were also found to use
knowledge sharing activities.

The  differences  found  in  using  laptops,
Communicators  and  PCs  should  also  be
reflected through how continual their use was
and  how  well  it  was  implemented  in  the
curricula. The laptops were used many times a
day  for  studying  in  the  school  while  the
Communicators were used less than once a
week and PCs once a week. The continual use
of the laptops compared to the two other
classes may have given a clearer idea of the
possibilities of using mobile devices. Thus it is
possible that the results regarding the class
using laptops were also the clearest.

The relationship between the deep approach
and knowledge-sharing activities in this study
might reflect the relation between how
information was initially processed and then
later shared with others. Although the surface
approach to learning was strongest in the class
using laptops, the knowledge-sharing activities
seemed to work well. This could just reflect the
fact that the pupils were flexible enough to use
different learning strategies and simply used
deep processing. The knowledge sharing, in
general, also seemed to be an issue in this
study,  as  again  in  the  class  using
Communicators the knowledge sharing seemed
unsuccessful. As the use of the devices was not
coherent, many unpredictable situation-specific
elements may have caused the differences
between the classes, rather than the different
media. These elements may have caused
fragmentation and had an effect on the transfer.

Two such elements could have been how
continual was the use of the media, and in what
kind of contexts were the learning activities
done? One explanation could be the continual
use of the laptops compared to the intermittent
use  of  the  Communicators  outdoors.  The
interviews and observations will clarify further
the differences between the different media use.

In  this  study  it  seemed  that  the  pupils’
knowledge conceptions had no implications for
the learning activities. The contextuality m-
component  did  not  get  any  empirical
confirmation from the data gathered with the
MLQ. The use of the devices for knowledge
seeking and construction activities did not have
a statistical significance either. However, as the
samples were small, the preliminary findings
cannot be generalised thoroughly.

3.2.  Interviews and observations on
mobile learning pilots

The  findings  of  fragmentation  in  mobile
learning pilots will be considered next in the
context  of  the  m-components.  With  the  m-
component of Continuity and adaptability we
study a flexible transformation between different
learning situations with the aid of a mobile
device. In the MLQ it is measured as surface
and deep approach in learning. In practice
spontaneous learning requires the abilities to
apply and reflect one’s knowledge. Basing on
the teachers’ interviews, the m-component of
Continuity and adaptability proves an essential
aspect  in  mobile  learning,  because  of  the
crossover between the different contexts, which
had been difficult to reach in the Communicator
pilot.  Children  have  had  difficulties  in
understanding that they can learn everywhere
and they can use the knowledge acquired in
contexts  other  than  school  as  well.  Here
fragmentation seems to intertwine with cultural
issues: children should be taught to appreciate
the knowledge they gain from their hobbies and
everyday activities. According to the teacher this
also means that learning has to be seen as a
personal process, which happens in different
situations  and  through  the  learner  bringing
his/her  own  personal  experiences  to  the
classroom situations. In mobile learning this can
be supported, for example, by choosing inquiry-
based  learning  methods  and  presenting  or
publishing the learning outcomes online.

The  difficulties  in  continuity  vary  also
depending on the maturity of the children both
as individuals and as a group. Group dynamics
may  hinder  the  differentiation.  In  the
Communicator pilot, for example, the children

jealously watched for the same chance to use
the devices, or demanded the teacher’s
attention at the same time.

Moreover, the children’s attitudes towards
the new gadgets may cause fragmentation in
learning. As the children used their personal
mobile phones basically for fun, they also
wanted to use the Communicators mainly for
entertainment purposes. Their enthusiasm
towards these devices diminished slightly when
the learning activities and tasks demanded
more information processing (Turunen et al.
2003). Meanwhile, the laptops were perceived
as tools and communication media over a full
school year. At this point we can recognise
another level of fragmentation, that is the level
of user cultures and how the teacher has to
react to these different user’s needs. From the
user cultures’ point of view, an edutainment
element might be useful when designing
materials  for  mobile  learning.  However,
teachers have noted that the earlier the children
learn to use the devices, the better they get at
the advanced methods of learning: cross-
disciplinary project work and the process-writing
method.

Connections  to  the  outside  world  and
different sources of information may also cause
chaos in the classroom (Sharples 2002; Mifsud
2002). The interviewed teachers agree that
copying from the internet is a growing problem
due to internet access. The primary school
pilots stressed that the use of mobile devices,
and accessibility to several different sources of
information, require a flexible conception of
knowledge.  In  MLQ  the  m-component  of
contextuality measures the user’s abilities to
search for information and its organisation as
well as their conception of knowledge. In the
pilot the inquiry learning method that engages
the pupils to reflect on their own thoughts and
actions has been used. With this method the
pupil learns to criticise certain facts and their
understanding develops within collaborative
group work.

The teacher still had a central role in helping
the pupil understand that using mobile devices
can really assist the learning processes. The
teachers of the Communicator pilot group
pointed out that it is crucial to the success of
the whole mobile learning process that the
pupils do not lift their informative goals too high.
During the pilot the children often thought that
the facts they observed had to be either
entertaining or really complex. This may also
reflect  the effect of information overflow in
today’s society and how the different media



sources present information in a more and more
entertaining way. Therefore it is important to
learn  to  recognise  different  sources  and
structures of knowledge.

Rubin and Kaivo-oja (2000) point out that as
the flow of information becomes increasingly
fragmented and uncontrolled, also real-time and
simultaneous, there is a danger that established
ways for managing information do not suffice.
The selection of relevant information becomes a
random affair, and choices are made based on
what appears to be fun, entertaining or useful at
the time. This increases social disempowerment.
From this point of view we can presumably
question whether there is another kind of level of
fragmentation. Is the learner’s experience so
fragmented that they do not understand enough
to process it, or do not have the time to process
it properly? If the learner does not have the time
to process the information enough it will not
become  a  part  of  their  knowledge.  More
attention should be paid to cultural and media
literacy: pupils’ ability to distinguish different
types of knowledge and to evaluate different
kinds of information sources (Rubin and Kaivo-
oja 2000). This requires new types of knowledge
and skills from the teachers too, and for many
teachers there is not enough time or easy tools
at hand to take over the issues of media literacy,
information searching and internet publishing.
Supplementary  education  on  the  topic  is
required, as well as easy tools and learning
materials!

Based on our pilot findings accessibility,
sufficient skill levels and desired possession of a
device, crucially affect the possibilities of mobile
learning. The teachers interviewed estimated
that fifth- and sixth-grade children possess the
required skill level for learning typical mobile
learning activities, and at the age of 11–12,
pupils have an interest in and need for it too.
However, it will not be easy to start mediated
learning with mobile devices unless they have
had previous experience with computers. Pupils
who already had good skills got further with the
Communicator,  while  those  with  poorer
computer skills got tired of trying to figure out the
complicated logic and user interface of the
device. The Communicator pilot did not reach
the content goals of the mobile learning; but for
those using the laptops their active content
production  increased  and  pupils  having
difficulties with it clearly improved their skills.
The differences also diminished with pupils who
did not have computers at home. Personal
laptops were perceived as inspiring throughout
the year, whereas eagerness about the irregular
and scattered use of Communicators diminished

after an enthusiastic beginning. Based on the
interviews and observations, therefore, it seems
that sufficient personal possession of the device
is required to eliminate fragmentation, ie to gain
routine in using a device and be able to focus
on learning contents. For the future it would be
useful  to  provide  equal  possibilities  for
mediated learning to all the pupils to capture
the learning part of mobile learning properly.

When offering tools for active and intentional
self-guided  learning  (time  and  learning
management) we see that mobile technology
can be well utilised in supporting differentiation
because it is a rather flexible and motivating
medium. Since pupils' technical and learning
skills vary, the teacher has a lot of work to tailor
lessons to meet everybody’s needs. The
teachers tend not to believe in using ready-
made learning content for mobile learning, but
they have seen the materials, which are
produced in mobile learning. For the more self-
guided pupil, directions on independent learning
tasks might work.

From the viewpoint of flexible interaction
the lack or inoperability of GPRS connections
were the main sources of fragmentation. In the
Communicator  pilot,  the  data  transfer
connections were not available. The pupils from
Pirkkala communicated with their peers in Kittilä
(Raattama’s school) by calling and sending text
messages (SMSs). With the laptops WLAN
worked fine in the school area, but because of
weak GPRS connections pupils were only able
to browse single web pages or read their e-
mails outside the school. The intended mobile
use of one web-based learning environment
was not possible because of its ‘heavyweight’
multimedia content. Still, the mobile devices did
enable meaningful learning tasks for small
groups and those working in pairs. Later on the
children willingly expressed themselves and
proudly showed at school what they had found
out  from  the  internet  or  created  with  the
devices. The possibility of publishing the work
on the internet and showing it to parents
boosted  their  motivation  and  the  level  of
outcomes.

4. Discussion and future work

According to the preliminary findings from
the MLQ, the knowledge-sharing activities
became more emphasised when the laptops
were used in the classroom in a continual
manner, even though the pupils did not have a
specific application designed to support this.
When properly instructed and implemented in
the curriculum, the laptops seemed to have



advantages in knowledge-sharing practices.
However their use outside the classroom could
affect this in an unpredictable way. As the use of
the devices was not coherent, the findings of the
preliminary analysis are hard to interpret: many
unpredictable situation-specific elements may
have caused the differences between the
classes, rather than the different devices.

Drawing on our findings we can draft some
preliminary guidelines for the design of mobile
learning practices and materials in the primary
school setting that could prevent fragmentation.
When seeking the sources of fragmentation in
pilot studies, accessibility becomes a central
theme. In the Communicator pilot the children
with  slight  difficulties  in  concentration  got
confused and interrupted the learning process
when they ‘got lost’ in the user interface. This
might have also been reflected in the learning
activities  measured  in  MLQ.  The  learning
content goals were also difficult to reach due to
the short period of use. The skills acquired with
the PC helped them become familiar with mobile
learning. However, sufficient possession and
use of the device is required to enable the
transformation to routine use when a learner is
able to concentrate in learning contents. Here,
the usability of a device is of great help in
adopting mobile learning practices. A sufficient
amount of time to process the learning content is
also  required  to  prevent  fragmentation  in
knowledge  construction.  As  the  knowledge
sharing and supporting the initial processing of
the knowledge aspects seemed to be issues in
our study, one should keep in mind the future
distribution of knowledge to others. Moreover,
the  problem  in  applying  flexible  interaction
implies the importance of good connections and
networks, but also the need for accessible web-
based learning materials and environments.

When  operating  with  the  device  the
environment and context offer other elements
that can distract the users’ attention. Although
there was no statistical significance found in the
pupils’ conceptions of knowledge, the interviews
and observations stressed the importance of a
flexible conception of knowledge. The classroom
culture and different user cultures set clashing
expectations  towards  mobility  and  mobile
learning. From the wider cultural perspective the
access  to  different  sources  of  information
requires new approaches towards knowledge
building and learning among both teachers and
pupils.

Based on our pilot findings, the teachers did not
believe in using ready-made learning contents,
rather using the materials produced in mobile

learning. The earlier the children learn to use
the devices as tools, the more flexibly they get
into the advanced methods of learning: cross-
disciplinary project work and the process writing
method. More attention should be paid to
cultural and media literacy, and to the children’s
ability  to  distinguish  different  types  of
knowledge and information sources. The
learning tools for information searching, content
processing  and  internet  publishing  can,
therefore, be presumed to be very useful. As
mobile learning is well suited to small groups
and working in pairs, its potential lies in
supporting social contacts and collaborative
learning. To restrain the possible effects of
fragmentation in mobile learning the user
should  have tools designed specifically for
mobile situations. The different knowledge
construction and learning management tools
being developed are important in highlighting
this need.

The MLQ showed consistency and sufficient
validity to be used in the next mobile learning
research pilot. However, it should be used in
evaluation with other methods and the findings
interpreted in relation to other results. The
questionnaire will be used in autumn 2003 in a
pre-post test research frame where different
devices (laptops, iPAQs and PCs) are piloted in
comprehensive school classes. The devices
and applications will be used and instructed
more coherently than in the preliminary study.
Fragmentation will be evaluated by interviewing
the teachers and by making observations of the
performed learning tasks. Future research
questions and actions concerning contextuality
in informal and mobile learning will be targeted
on adult learners and their learning processes.

A task-centred approach to evaluating a mobile learning
environment for pedagogical soundness

Abstract

This focus of this paper is how to evaluate the
pedagogical soundness of a mobile learning
environment  in  which  many  users  (both
teachers and learners) may not have previously
encountered mobile technology, so may be
uncertain how best to deploy it to achieve their
goals. Drawing on concepts from Activity Theory
and the socio-cognitive engineering method
described by Sharples (2000), it describes an
approach which enables an enriched view of
users’ current and future activities, which in
turn will allow us to understand the range of
actions and opportunities open to mobile
learners, and seek ways of extending this range
to support what learners want to do – even if
they themselves do not yet know what that is.

Keywords: learning, socio-cognitive
engineering, Activity Theory, pedagogy,
evaluation, mobile environments

1.  Introduction

A major goal of the worldwide, European-led
research and development project MOBIlearn is:

the creation of a virtual network for the
diffusion of knowledge and learning via a mobile
environment where, through common themes,
it is possible to demonstrate the convergence
and merging of learning supported by new
technology, knowledge management, and new
forms of mobile communication.

MOBIlearn Technical Annex 1, page 7

The project aims to evaluate the pedagogic
effectiveness of the learning environment thus
developed to ensure that it is sound. Although
there  are  tried  and  tested  methods  for
pedagogic evaluation of specific applications
of technology for learning (eg Draper et al.
1996;  Scanlon et al. 2000), there are no
existing  comprehensive  frameworks  for
broader formative evaluation in the mobile
environment, largely because of its novelty –
relatively few teachers and learners have
experience of working in this way, so we are
simultaneously  introducing  new  ways  of

engaging in learning with new artefactsand
evaluating technical and pedagogic effectiveness.
This requires careful consideration so as not to
skew the evaluation data gathered from users,
who may find themselves fascinated by the
new devices in a way which they may find
interesting, and even fun, but which produces
no lasting valuable impact on their work
practices. They may simply then avoid using
the technology ‘in anger’ once the evaluation
study is complete.

Therefore, to make progress in achieving
our goals, we must develop a thorough
understanding of:

•the learning opportunities presented by
the new mobile technology

•its (potential) impact on the way people
perform learning tasks

•its (potential) impact on human social
processes and interactions

•how these in turn are changed or modified
by the technology.

In the rest of this paper we briefly indicate
how it is possible to develop this
understanding driven by task-centred user
requirements rather than technological
advances,   so describing the approach that
underpins our evaluation strategy for
MOBIlearn.

2.  Pedagogy in the mobile environment
Developments in pedagogy have moved away
from   the transmissive mode of teaching and
learning and toward the constructivist or socio-
cognitive models, placing the active learner at
the heart of activities. In this view learning is:

a  personal  idiosyncratic  experience,
characterised by individuals developing
knowledge and understanding it through
the forming and re-forming of concepts.
The focus of constructivism is on learner
control, with learners making decisions that
match their own cognitive states and
needs.

Farmer and Taylor 2002



The socio-cognitive view would also add that
learning takes place in a social context (see
Rogers 2002), and the forming and re-forming
of concepts need not necessarily take place
only at the level of the individual. Collaborative
group  work  and  sharing  with  peers  (and
others) can be a powerful way of confronting
one’s  own  conceptions  (pre-conceptions),
contributing  to  the  perceived  need  to
restructure  one’s  cognitive  schemas.  So
learning can be perceived as being as much
about communication as it is about content. In
fact,  some  more  radical  pedagogical
approaches, facilitated by mobile computing,
would go a step further, and suggest that no
content is a useful starting point for learning. A
group of learners may decide themselves what
they are going to learn, and how they are
going to learn it, bringing their own material to
bear in whatever way they feel appropriate.
The MOBIlearn project embraces this view of
learning,  with  its  emphasis  on  rapid
communication and access to resources.

In this context, however, although usability
is an important issue for evaluators, it is not
enough to say that because the usability
requirements  have  been  satisfied,  the
MOBIlearn project has been successful from
the pedagogic perspective. Pedagogical
evaluation demands to understand not only
whether or not a learner has succeeded in
learning, but why. Understanding the reasons
for success or failure depends on deep
knowledge of the appropriate relationship of
tasks  to technology – an area of knowledge
that spans both the pedagogic/educational,
and the technical fields.

From the point of view of usability,
educators and learners have raised the
concern that the handheld elements of the
mobile environment have very small screens
which do not facilitate easy access to text, and
small keyboards which impede input of, or
annotation of, content and do not support skim
reading (see Kukulska-Hulme 2002). These
are real ergonomic concerns but they are not
fatal for the learning enterprise because it
depends what role the handheld is playing in
the activity. For example, few would argue that
using a current personal digital assistant
(PDA) as an ersatz laptop, to access and read
large documents, is an optimal use of the
device. However, using the PDA to find or
share documents to download onto a desk-top
or laptop computer for later perusal is perfectly
feasible. We must beware trying to make
devices perform beyond their capacity to
deliver what is required, but, rather, we should
examine potential activities that could be

supported, and evaluate the pedagogic
benefits of these activities, which may be
distributed across several devices. The whole
experience needs to be evaluated, not just the
component parts. This will mean ensuring that
mobile technologies are used appropriately to
exploit their potential, for example supporting
activities that might simply be impossible
without them. This is quite a challenge for
evaluation because we have to recognise that
the integration of new tools into existing
activities creates a dialectic – the tool
introduces new possibilities for action, and
new constraints (see Waycott et al. 2002)
which change how the activity is performed.

We must also take into account that, in
adopting the human-centred view, it would be
philosophically  unacceptable  for  us  to
disregard learners’ existing tasks and their
structures, and impose tasks upon them that
we  as  designers  or  teachers  think  are
‘beneficial’  –  ie  possibly  favouring  the
capabilities of the technology rather than the
users. As stated earlier, the active learner is at
the heart of the enterprise, so we need to
observe and analyse the effect of technology
on learner actions, activities, intentions and
goals as they engage in learning. Sometimes
they will change, for good reason; sometimes
they will not.

3.  Understanding activities

Addressing this issue, we have adopted the
socio-cognitive engineering method for system
design (Sharples 2000; Sharples et al. 2002)
which describes a two-stage process: first,
activity  analysis sets constraints on the
system design and analyses how people work
and  interact  with  their  current  tools  and
technologies; and, second, design of new
technology is integrated into the user’s or
learner’s environment and activity structures.
One technique for activity analysis is the
Future Technology Workshop (Vavoula et al.
2002). In these workshops, participants are
encouraged to consider the range of, and
benefits of, their existing activities before being
supported  in  thinking  about  how  those
activities  could  be  more  effective  when
supported by new technologies and services.
This  allows  participants  to  approach  the
concept of a new activity structure in a way
that has their goals at the forefront of the
discussion, rather than subsumed beneath the
glamour  and  glitz  of  new  technology.  In
addition to this method, an Activity Theory
view (see Mwanza 2001) informs our analysis
of the environment in which the activities are
taking place, other potential collaborators in
the  activity,  and  the  ways  in  which



organisational requirements can impinge on
those activities.

Through this enriched view of users and
their current and future activities, in which
learning is viewed as a distributed activity, we
can better understand the range of actions and
opportunities on offer to mobile learners, and
seek ways of extending this range to support
what learners want to do – even if they
themselves do not yet know what that is. This
broadening of the scope of the ‘learning
system’ enables a much deeper understanding
of users’ needs, and the constraints that
govern their behaviour.

From the evaluator’s point of view, then, the
task is to evaluate the effectiveness with which
learners are able to achieve their goals, and
complete learning activities, irrespective of the
specific devices that might have been used in
doing so. Indeed, the same or similar activities
could be instantiated in a variety of different
ways depending on availability of technical
support (eg access to wireless Local Area
Network, LAN) and user preferences. In so
doing, we will necessarily be evaluating the
validity of the tasks themselves as vehicles for
learning.

4.  Conclusion

The  evaluation  framework  for  the
MOBIlearn project is driven both top-down and
bottom-up. The theoretical perspectives of

Activity  Theory  and  constructivism,  here
represented by the socio-cognitive method,
allow  us  to  analyse  learners  in  their
appropriate contexts and to understand the
nature of their learning tasks, and how they go
about them.

The Future Technology Workshops provide
us with much useful data on the views of
potential mobile learners and what they see as
crucial elements in their learning activities. At
the same time, usability studies are, of course,
essential. As the MOBIlearn system is being
developed, standard usability testing is being
performed  on  component  software  and
devices,  in  parallel  with  higher-level
evaluations of pedagogic benefit.

Figure 1 illustrates the complexity of the
task before us. At the bottom levels are sub-
systems being purpose-built for the MOBIlearn
system. These need to be technically verified
and tested.

There are also existing sub-systems being
deployed within the overall architecture which
we can assume have already been technically
validated. When we have brought all the sub-
systems up to a common level, we will test the
communication protocols between them, both
in pairs and all together. At this point, we will
have a basic instantiation of the MOBIlearn
system.

But, of course, that is only half the story.
We then need to embed that system in an
environment that can be used for our learning
purposes. At that point, we will begin to
engage in the higher-level evaluation involving
socio-pedagogic perspectives and pedagogic
validity.

The  important  point  to  remember  is
captured in Figure 2, which illustrates the flow
of evaluation data around the system. Here we
can see that the more technical testing, which

might  very  well  involve  users,  flows
information up to the higher levels of the
evaluation design. In turn, the more abstract
analyses – meaning those further distant from
the actual implementation issues – are flowing
data down to inform the design.

A key issue for the project in the future will
be to ensure that the two levels can meet
intelligently in the middle with a mutually
informing discourse. We believe that the task-
centred approach will facilitate this marriage.

Abstract

While this paper looks at the definitions of
heuristics and usability as they apply to digital games,
its primary focus is expanding the usability dialogue
into the arena of mobile educational games.

Recent discussions of game heuristics have made
some useful connections between work completed in
heuristics and game design theory. This paper
expands the usability dialogue, beginning where
these discussions have left off, and draws on
interviews with educational game developers, game
design theory, and game analyses to put forward
design principles intended to be useful for the
development and evaluation of mobile educational
games.

Introduction

This paper considers the potential application of
industry  practice  to  the  development  of  mobile
educational games, and its appropriateness,  and
identifies guiding principles that can be used in the
development of educational games. The development
of a set of educational game heuristics, or usability
guidelines, is a useful undertaking not only because it
creates a guide for the investigation of usability
issues, but also because, once identified, game
heuristics  can  help  developers  avoid  usability
problems in the first place.

Heuristics is grounded in a process of inductive
reasoning. Heuristic principles are developed through
problem-solving – situations are examined,

experiences are drawn on and usable solutions are
uncovered through trial and error. Usability is
therefore, in a sense, the extent to which heuristics
can successfully operate.

Heuristic evaluation – traditionally, evaluation in
which  a  small  team  of  independent  evaluators
compare user interfaces with a set of usability
guidelines, the ‘heuristics’ – has been recognised as
an effective method for the formative evaluation of
educational software (Quinn 1996; Albion 1999;
Squires and Preece 1999). Heuristic evaluation
using six evaluators uncovers 75% of usability
problems (Nielsen 1994) and is considered a cost-
effective method of evaluation that yields reliable
results for minimum investment (Quinn 1996).

But while heuristics has gained some attention as
a useful tool in the educational software arena for
examining user interfaces, usability, in general, is
still  a  relatively  foreign  concept  in  the  game
development  community  (Federoff  2002).
Furthermore,  a  comprehensive  list  of  heuristic
principles  dealing  with  the  usability  of  digital
educational games, not to mention those available
on mobile platforms, is virtually nonexistent. Recent
discussions of game heuristics have made some
useful connections between Nielsen’s heuristics and
Malone’s heuristics, and Csikszentmihalyi’s flow
theory, and conventional game development theory
and practice (Jarvinen et al. 2002; Federoff 2002).

We are interested in contributing to the dialogue
surrounding usability and heuristics, primarily from
an  educational  gaming  perspective.  This  paper
focuses  on  providing  conceptual  solutions  to
potential design problems and puts forward for
discussion principles that will benefit educationalists
involved in commissioning, developing or evaluating
mobile learning games.



Towards an educational gaming strategy

There is little consensus among practitioners and
researchers on the use of games for learning when
the delivery mechanisms are consoles or PCs;
consider how much more complicated educational
game play becomes when you add in the variable of
mobility.

For over 20 years educationalists have been
discussing the potential for the application of digital
games to learning. Yet in this same time – a time,
which incidentally has seen remarkable advances on
the technological side of gaming – there has been
little progress toward the realisation of digital games’
learning potential.  Although there are an increasing
number of positive reports and initiatives within the
area of educational gaming technology, instructional
designers, academics, teachers and governmental
agencies are still embroiled in debates about whether
games can, both practically and ethically, be used in
education.

The overriding sentiment against the use of games
to teach seems to be that learning is a serious
endeavour that requires serious tools. Even in
situations where games are commissioned, design
specifications are broad and games are viewed as a
homogenous entity, an easy, one size fits all,
motivational band-aid (or sticking plaster) perfectly
suited  to the ‘thumb-twitch’ generation. The result is
that all too often the games developed neither instruct
nor engage the learner (Garris et al. 2002) because
consideration has not been given to the needs of the
learner.  If learning is a situated activity, then it follows
that it is not possible to prescribe a game typology
that suits all learning situations (Squires and
McDougall 1996).

The difficulty is that while we can conceptualise a
‘good’ learning game there are few models we can
follow in the production of these games. Educational
game designers often turn to the commercial game
industry for guidance. But while the mass-market
model of gaming practised by the gaming industry is
immensely  valuable,  it  is  not  automatically
transferable to the learning context in all senses.

There are several reasons for this. First, because
of  the  commercial  nature  of  gaming,  game
developers are concerned with producing material
that  will be palatable to the mass market. This
becomes even more intensified with games for
mobile phones, where development cycles are a
month or two, instead of the two to three year
average development cycle for console games.

In a sense the commercial games industry
struggles with many of the teething pains that exist
for educational gaming. Developers can articulate
what makes a good game – although not all agree.
For instance, Freeman (1997) suggests:

•a good game empowers your imagination

•a good game makes you feel in charge

•a good game is transparent. You only feel
your own mind, the other player and the

ideas

•a good game lets you into its creator’s
imagination

•a good game lets its players feel each
other’s personality

•a good game fits the human being like a
glove.

But  as  Federoff  (2002)  points  out,  game
development companies could benefit from a greater
understanding of what makes their games usable.
Further, if game development companies are not
able to articulate what exactly makes their games
fun, how much harder does this task become when
they are commissioned to make mobile games that
help people learn? What conditions are needed to
promote not just user-centred design but learner-
centred design?

Learner-centred design

The vocabulary of software usability centres on
effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction (ISO 9241-
11) and looks at how easy in general it is to use
software, how effectively users can achieve goals
and how easy it is for them to learn to do so.
Researchers,  particularly  in  the  field  of
human–computer interaction (HCI), have developed
comprehensive sets of usability guidelines to help
designers produce better, more usable systems
(McGrenere 1996). (For more information on HCI
see the usability, user interface design and HCI
bibliography  at www.humanfactors.com/downloads/
bibliography.asp)

But efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction
don’t necessarily add up to a ‘good’ mobile learning
game. To accomplish this we must move away from
considerations of user-centred design and look
toward learner-centred design (Soloway et al. 1994).
This means constructing learning environments that
are adaptive, scalable, robust, reflexive and feature
modularity, automation and variability (Manovich
2001). Such environments are built by valuing an
individual’s creative energy; for instance, learners
are  part of a ‘cotext’ rather than a ‘context’ (Akman
and Bazzanella 2003; Walz 2002) and the game’s
design takes into account players’ ‘emissions’ rather
than only considering their immersion (Walz 2002;
Csikszentmihalyi 1991).

A key problem in the development of educational
games is balancing how much of the game is a
game and how much of the game is learning (Squire
et al. 2003). Developers who become involved in
educational games projects must wrestle with how to
incorporate learning into games – and be able to
differentiate between the different types of learning
they can incorporate (ie knowledge, skills, curriculum



content) – while retaining the qualities that make
games fun. As a result, many learning games,
particularly those targeted to a teen or adult
audience, lack the qualities that make commercial
games so enticing and end up ‘dumbing’ down
educational content: ‘most existing edutainment
products combine the entertainment value of a bad
lecture with the educational value of a bad game’
relying ‘on drill and memorization and have graphics
and gameplay that fall well below industry standards’
(Jenkins 2002). It is easy to surmise that these
challenges will not simply disappear but, instead, will
be compounded when mobility is added to the design
mix.

Mobility

For all intents and purposes, the commercial
mobile games industry is overrun by PC and arcade
games from days gone by. These games have simply
been ported to mobile devices: they are not ‘truly’
mobile; they are merely portable. The problem is that
these games were originally designed to be played
on PCs or consoles capable of rendering intensive
graphics rather than on mobile devices with limited
performance and limited graphic complexity. Further,
during development little attention is paid to the
device’s small screen size, restricted performance,
and limited means of input (Liljedal 2002).

Mobile games have evolved considerably during
their 20-year existence. The first contender in the
mobile gaming arena was Nintendo’s Game & Watch
handheld and today commercial devices used for
mobile gaming include mobile phones, personal
digital assistants (PDAs), handheld computers, smart
phones, game-specific devices such as Nintendo’s
Game Boy Advance SP, and hybrid devices such as
Nokia’s N-gage, TTPCom’s b’ngo, MyOrigo’s
mydevice, and Tapwave’s Palm OS Zodiac gaming
device. Future offerings include Sony’s PlayStation
Portable (PSP), which, if publicity is to be believed,
will revolutionise the handheld industry with
specifications that Sony Computer Entertain-ment
Europe president Chris Deering claims are like the
‘PlayStation 2 minus a bit’.

These  new  device  specifications  should
encourage designers and developers to look beyond
the current practice of designing for ‘stand-alone’
gaming experiences. The first step in this process is

to  consider  connectivity,  to  simply  think  about
connecting learners either to each other or to a
central  server.  Most  handheld  devices  permit
connectivity between devices through a USB port or
wirelessly via Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), or
infra-red. Further, network connectivity means that
learners are no longer isolated; they can still play
games as individuals but they can also benefit from
all the functionality that being connected to the
internet or a back-end database can offer, such as
customised learning and increased capabilities for
adaptive learning.

Mobile learning, not portable learning

Portable learning experiences offer ‘advantages
in price and accessibility’ (Klopfer and Squire 2003)

– it is more cost effective, for instance, to buy
handhelds  than  to  kit  out  every  student  in  a
classroom with a laptop or PC. However, they don’t
make use of what mobile devices can really offer,
namely, connectivity, location sensitivity and context
awareness; nor do they allow for ubiquity, which
would make the ‘real-world environment’ an ‘intrinsic
and meaningful game element’ (Bjork et al. 2002).

Although connectivity opens the door to limitless
possibilities  for  interaction,  it  is  valuable  to
remember it is only one piece of the mobile learning
equation. Mobile games are played while learners
are on the move and such things as ‘the player’s
direction, speed, location, or proximity to objects in
the  physical  world’  (Liljedal 2002)  can  be
incorporated into gameplay. Incorporating this type
of functionality also raises a variety of questions that
require answers. Who and what will the player
interact with? At what proximity? For how long?

Commercial  games,  such  as Nokia  game,
Picofun, Botfighters and Blue factory, make use of
location, position (both ordinary and relative), and
movement between locations, but they don’t take
into account the environment that the player is
playing in. Context awareness can be an integral
part of the mobile gaming experience and includes
factors such as speed, direction, timing, changing
surroundings, acceleration, manipulation of objects,
and issues such as dealing with multiple entries and
exits, and no on or off switch (Liljedal 2002). In a
context-aware gaming situation consideration is not
only given to the player’s relationship with the
objects that he or she interacts with but to the
player’s progress while playing and to cooperation
between players (Liljedal 2002). The reasons for not
incorporating  context  into  games  are  obvious,
particularly on the commercial front: context-aware
games are time-consuming and expensive to make,
there are few models to follow, and commercial
operators and publishers are unwilling to take risks.
But  the  introduction  of  true  mobility  (versus
portability) offers unparalleled learning opportunities,
marrying the benefits of gaming with some of the
value that comes out of the classroom – reflection,
mediation,  collaboration  and  opportunities  for
enhancing learning transfer.

General approach: exogenous play

One of the practical challenges that developers
face when making learning games is how to fuse
gameplay and learning seamlessly, as in the case of
Rieber’s exogenous play, ‘play which is not removed
from a learning experience, but inherent to it’ (Squire
et al.2003). Edutainment games typically have two
obvious components: gaming and learning. The
player can see where the learning begins and can
easily separate this from the gameplay. A seamless



learning  experience,  in  contrast,  is  much  more
difficult  to  construct.  The  gameplay  cannot  be
separated from the learning content. The game’s
structure, interface and so on, is the instructional
content.  The  player  is  immersed  in  a  learning
experience because the entirety of the game is
learning. Such experiences are beneficial because
learning is tied to intrinsic rather than extrinsic
motivation – the player wants to complete the game
for feelings of personal satisfaction rather for an
external reward (Deci 1972; Malone 1981). There are
few learning games that have achieved Rieber’s holy
grail of exogenous play. However, there are groups,
in particular MIT’s Games-To-Teach project, that are
working toward this (see http://cms.mit.edu/games/
education/proto.html for examples of prototypes).

One area of gaming that has had reasonable
success marrying games and learning is simulation
gaming. Crookall et al. (1987) argue that a ‘simulation
is   a representation of some real-world system that
can also take on some aspects of reality for
participants or users’. Simulations are characterised
by  ‘reality of function’: if a learner adopts the role of a
chairman she really is ‘a chairman with all the power,
authority, and duties to complete the task’ (Jones
1984). One of the key benefits of using simulations
for learning is that in simulations learners see the
consequences of decisions and actions they make
without experiencing the real-world consequences of
their mistakes.

Games, in contrast, do not ‘intend to represent any
real-world systems’; they are ‘systems in their own
right’. Squire et al. point out that ‘structurally games
differ from simulations in that games (usually) have
an additional narrative back story and context, one or
more challenges, and various “failure” and “win”
states’  and  players  ‘immerse  themselves  within
games  and  their  more  immediate  participation
expands the opportunities for mastering the content’
(Squire et al. 2003).

However, simulations can take on game features.
For instance, Garris et al. developed a game-based
submarine periscope trainer for the US Navy and
found that it provided more effective training than a
training simulation without any game characteristics
(Garris et al. 2002). Commercial game simulations,
from Life and death to Rollercoaster tycoon, have
educational value because, as Prensky points out in
Digital game-based learning (2001), ‘to keep most
learners’ engagement you have to keep making it fun

– fun from the player’s, not the creator’s, perspective.
Perhaps counter-intuitively, having an extremely high-
fidelity simulation that exactly imitates life can
sometimes take the fun out of it. So can not giving the
player enough choices, or enough humorous or even
outrageous possibilities’.

Principles of mobile game learning

To understand better what elements contribute to
effective  mobile  game  learning  we  reviewed
literature related to games and learning, interviewed
key figures involved in the development of learning
games,  conducted  critical  game-analyses,  and
looked at good practice within the commercial game
industry, validating its relevance and increasing its
scope to address mobile game learning.

It is not our intention in this paper to put forward
a comprehensive list of game learning principles
(for  such  a  list  see  the  work  completed  at
www.pervasivelearning.org), but rather to present a
few categories of the principles that our research
has  identified  as  particularly  relevant  to  the
development of mobile learning games.

1.  Adaptation

One important characteristic of games is that they
can adapt. If games are adaptive they support
‘learner preferences for different access pathways’
and allow the learner ‘to find relevant information
while at the same time remaining immersed in the
game’ (Quinn 1996). In adaptive games the level of
difficulty increases or decreases depending on a
player’s performance. The game intervenes when a
player is in trouble. For instance, in Byzantine: the
betrayal a helper character steps in to assist the
player in tackling difficult situations if help is needed.
In Tech deck skateboarding the game adapts to the
player by adjusting the amount of time permitted for
completing events as the player advances to higher
levels. Poccer, a Pocket PC football game, adapts
by speeding up or slowing down the computer
opponent depending on the player’s score.

However,  adaptability  is  more  than  simply
increasing or decreasing a game’s difficulty level.
The effectiveness of mobile learning games can be
improved by the introduction of an even greater level
of adaptability to player’s actions, particularly if the
game explicitly monitors students’ interactions and
learning patterns, and intervenes when constructive
reasoning and reflection need to be triggered (Conati
and Klawe 2000). Adaptiveness, therefore, is not
only a structural response to a learner’s actions but
plays  a  crucial  role  in  mediating  the  learning
experience. Learning outcomes can be associated
with key behavioural indicators. These indicators
will, in turn, cause the game to adapt if the player is
having  difficulty  or  needs  greater  challenge
(Pagulayan et al. 2002). If the indicators do not
suggest the player is experiencing difficulty, the
game does not adapt and continues on its ‘course’.

An extension of this type of adaptive mediation is
to generate the game completely on the ‘fly’, tailoring
learning to the user. In this type of adaptive learning
situation, ‘the cognition activities that users have to
perform, the difficulty of the problems behind the
game, the sceneries presented and the organization
of  these  elements,  among  others,  can  be



dynamically selected or generated for each particular
user depending on his/her personal features and
behaviors’ (Carro et al. 2002).

2.  Challenge and mastery

Learners with varying skill levels play games.
There are a number of different strategies for
designing games to accommodate this variability
while still keeping players challenged. Ryan (1999)
advocates designing a game for players with a
median skill level, determined through an iterative
design process which features play testing both
extremes (skilled and unskilled players) and using the
results to identify where the game needs to be made
easier or harder.

Laramee identifies three types of difficulty curves
for games: the flat curve, the linear progression and
the s-curve (Laramee 2002). In the flat curve the
game’s difficulty does not change and traditional
game levels are replaced with a series of ‘activities’
or tasks with an equal difficulty level; this is the typical
approach in edutainment games that are ‘targeted to
a  very narrow age group with specific knowledge and
ability expectations’ (Laramee 2002). In the linear
progression type of difficulty, challenge increases
steadily throughout the game. While easy to
implement, this model is dangerous because it may
not  give the player the necessary amount of time to
learn the game before progressing to a harder level
and, as a result, the player may never be able to
complete the game. The s-curve starts slowly and
lets the player learn how to play the game,
sometimes through a tutorial, at other times through
training levels. The difficulty level gets steeper during
the bulk of the game and in the last two to five hours
flattens out, allowing players who make it through
most of the game to survive through to the finish
(Laramee 2002).

Games motivate when they challenge players and,
at the same time, maintain the ‘illusion of winnability’
(Nawrocki and Winner 1983; Crawford 1982). Games
should not offer one single way of winning (Crawford
1982; Malone 1982; Shelley 2001), because if a
game is ‘winnable … it will lose its appeal’ (Crawford
1982). Players are challenged and strive to improve
when complexity increases (Squire et al. 2003). In the
simplest of terms, games have to get harder to keep
a player’s interest. ‘The first time a player sets foot in
a Diablo dungeon, a skeleton is a powerful foe.
However, it does not remain so for very long; if the
player had to keep hacking away at basic skeletons
throughout the game, boredom would soon set in’
(Laramee 2002). Challenges (and challengers)
should be introduced slowly, often in isolation, so that
players get the opportunity to study their behaviour
(Laramee 2002). It takes trial and error for players to
find  the best ways to defeat a game’s challenges, but
players face each progressive challenge with the
knowledge  learned  from  challenges  already
accepted.

Bushnell points out that ‘a good game should be
easy to learn and hard to master’ (in Federoff 2002).
This ties in nicely with the idea of replayability:
games are intended to be played over and over
again. Players engage in cycles of gameplay –
repeated judgement-behaviour-feedback loops –
that  see users making decisions based on scenarios
put forward in the game, acting on those decisions,
and getting feedback based on what they’ve done
(Garris et al.2002). Users enter the gameplay cycle
to beat the challenges presented to them. ‘The point
of the game, what keeps the boys playing, is the
promise – the intimation that with enough energy,
enough focus, and enough lives, he might master
this machine’ (Weinbren 1995).

3.  Goals

A basic rule of instructional design put forward by
Gagne in 1965 seems like commonsense but is still
extremely relevant today: ‘inform learners of
objectives’. Gagne suggested that when learners
were made aware of objectives they had an
expectation for learning.

A quite similar fundamental rule exists for game
design: ‘Games should provide enticing long-term
goals’ (Barwood and Falstein 2003). Further, these
goals need to be presented early (Clanton 1998;
Malone 1982), need to be clearly stated, and should
be  personally  meaningful,  obvious,  and  easily
generated (Malone 1981). Designers need to ‘tune
the message to the content’ (Crawford 2003); in
other words, game goals and learning goals need to
be one and the same.

But while games should have one clear overriding
goal – for instance, ‘rescue the Princess Zelda’ –
they also need to have clear short-term goals: sub-
games that build towards the overall goal (Barwood
and Falstein 2003).. Short-term objectives guide
players through the game (instead of being faced
with the insurmountable task of saving the world
they find out that first they need to meet the oracle).
They help players avoid ‘the frustration of
uncertainty’ and reassure players that they are
making progress (Barwood and Falstein 2003).
Short-term goals can be explicit or implicit: players
can  be told directly (for instance, in the Legend of
Zelda: link to the past you meet characters who tell
you what your game tasks are, eg ‘you need to climb
to the tower to find the Moon Pearl’) or given cues by
the environments they are exploring (for instance, in
Halo the landscape itself and suggestions from in-
game companions push players toward the next
short-term goal (Barwood and Falstein 2003). Along
the  way the game should also provide performance
feedback on how close the user is to achieving the
goal (Malone 1981).



4.  Community and collaboration

One of the advantages of using mobile devices for
gaming is the opportunities they offer for community
and collaboration. Cooperative learning environments

– situations where learners work in collaboration to
achieve  learning  goals  and  receive  rewards  or
recognition  based  on  their  group’s  performance
(Slavin 1980) – have been found to foster positive
interdependence among learners, which translates
into positive interpersonal relations and attitudes
(McGrenere 1996).

Mobile multiplayer learning games require positive
goal interdependence (Cohen 1994),  positive
resource interdependence (Cohen, 1994), positive
reward interdependence (Cohen 1994), group
evaluation opportunities, and individual accountability
(Hymel et al. 1993). Collaboration, therefore, does
not disregard the value of individualist learning
structures – Yeuh and Alessi (1988) maintained that
a combination of group and individual rewards
produced higher achievement and increased peer-
tutoring. Joint discovery and exploration is a valuable
activity that allows one player’s understanding of a
game, and the inherent learning within it, to shape
another player’s understanding (Liljedal 2002).

In her review of educational electronic multiplayer
games McGrenere (1996) expanded on Grudin’s
‘paradox of collaboration’, pointing out ‘we interact
with other people continually and usually rather
effortlessly, but designing computer support for
collaboration is very difficult because we have to
actually understand how groups and organizations
function.  Collaborative  activities  fail  because
designers don’t understand the fundamentals of
group behaviour’.

Interestingly, inroads have been made on the
collaborative front in commercial roleplaying games
which recognise that the story comes not from the
game, but from the struggle of multiplayer opponents
and  collaborators  (Levine  2001).  Massively
multiplayer online roleplaying games (MMORPGs)
such as Everquest, Asheron’s call, and Planetside
offer the quintessential collaborative experience,
featuring thousands of players who go head to head
in worlds that are available 24 hours a day. As Oliver
points out: ‘Within the roleplay of the MMORPG,
character development is better termed “capacity
development”; the player is wilfully locked into a
system of performance centred around growth’ which
sees collaboration driven by proximity: players meet
in  safe  public  spaces  such  as  lobbies  or  town
squares and organise teams for mission (Oliver
2002). These scenarios also tackle central issues of
collaborative  learning  –  ‘activity  coordination
problems; within-group communication problems; the
difficulty of properly organising individual work with
joint group activities; negotiation problems; lack of
group synchronization; lack of interaction with other
group members’ (Zurita et al. 2003). Interesting too is
how  coordination  is  achieved  in  these  vast

multiplayer expanses – after all players could roam
randomly without needing to make contact with other
players for days. Designers know well how to force
players to collaborate. First, they make the spaces
for collaboration safe, as opposed to the other parts
of the game which are inordinately ‘scary’ (Oliver
2002). Second, they use a design technique which
Squire et al. (2003) point out goes back to Dungeons
and  dragons (or farther): they give players a
motivation to play together. Players must collaborate
precisely because they need what other players
offer. ‘One of the core game design mechanisms for
encouraging  collaboration  is  the  notion  of
differentiating between different players’ roles, so
that players must collaborate to succeed in a world’
(Squire et al. 2003).

Another  important  consideration  in  the
development of collaborative game structures is that
learning is based on ‘frequency of task-related
interaction’. Given a problem with no right answer
and a learning task that will require all students to
exchange resources, achievement gains will depend
on how often players engage in interactions related
to the task (Cohen 1994). Also important is ensuring
that players understand the game goals and that the
learning objectives are inherent in the goals. Players
must know the point of the mission. If they know they
have to take over an enemy prison they can adopt
appropriate roles and develop strategies: ‘if learning
is for understanding and involves higher order
thinking, then tasks and instructions which foster
maximum  interaction,  mutual  exchange,  and
elaborated discussions will be more beneficial than
tasks and instructions which constrain and routinize
interaction’ (McGrenere 1996).

5. Context

Squires (1997) points out that both components of
a learning environment – people and artefacts –
interact and contribute to the learning process. This
environment, including all the ‘implicit situational
information’ that learners use to communicate, is
considered context (Dey and Abowd 2000). Most
games make little use of context; they do not
incorporate  the  learner’s  environment  into  the
gameplay experience. However, when learners have
increased freedom of mobility, in situations where
the users’ contexts, such as location and the people
and objects around them, are more dynamic (Dey
and Abowd 2000), games need to consider context
(see table below) and adapt appropriately.



Considerations for context-aware mobile games
PresenceWho is playing the game?

LocationWhere are learners playing

the game?

Activity levelHow active are they?

ActionsWhat are they doing?

IntentionsWhat will they do next?

Where will they be?

ChangesWhat changes are they

making, and where?

ObjectsWhat objects are they using?

What objects could they use?

ExtentsWhat can they see? How far

can they reach?

AbilitiesWhat can they do?

1994; McDougall and Squires 1986). While Malone
and Lepper (1987) suggest that it is the perception
of control rather than actual control that is most
important, perception of control is affected by how
responsive the game is to player choices and, in
fact, how many choices are on offer to the player.
There is a sense that this ‘ideal of perception’ was
driven in part by the technological deficiencies that
existed in the late 1980s and that it has continued to
be the ideal expressed over the last 20 years
because the possibility of players really controlling
the games they play could not be practically
realised.

Mobile learning games have the potential to offer
players  agency  rather  than  the  trickery  and
perception of control. Situated learning experiences
that give players the opportunity not only to write the

content of their own stories, but to create structurally
the games they play are only a mobile device away.


ExpectationsWhat do players want the

game to be able to do?

Adapted from Cutwin and Greenberg 1996

Context  awareness  also  involves  more  than
accounting for a player’s immediate context. Context-
aware multiplayer games need to take into account
the context of all players playing the game. They
need to go beyond thinking about ‘being there’ and
consider ‘beyond being there’ so that players at a
distance are not at a disadvantage and the game
offers more than just playing face-to-face (Hollan and
Stornetta 1992).

Discussion

While  the  principles  presented  here  provide  a
conceptual overview of what could become ‘good
practice’  in  relation  to  the  development  and
evaluation of mobile learning games, only a handful
of  principles  have  been  illustrated.  Feedback,
consistency and competition are other key game
characteristics that we have found integral to the
game development process.

The aim of this paper has been to highlight the need
for comprehensive research and evaluation of
usability principles and initiate a dialogue in which
usability frameworks can be modified, enhanced and
validated by the mobile learning community.

There is value too in identifying how learning
concepts such as reflection, scaffolding, mediation
and debriefing can be addressed. One consideration
that should not be overlooked when designing mobile
learning games is the educational potential offered by
including the player in the game creation process.
Instead of the game programming the player, the
player should program the game (Papert 1993).

The extent to which learners can develop a sense
of ownership in the game environment is closely
linked to the level of control they have in their
interactions (Blease 1988; Chandler 1984; Goforth

Before this is achieved and embraced by the

learning community, however, frameworks for the
design  and  delivery  of  meaningful  pedagogical
materials need to be carefully researched, tested
and evaluated. The principles outlined in this paper
represent  an  important  first  step  towards  this,
particularly in the area of mobile learning.

Abstract

The EU m-learning project coordinated by
LSDA is developing a mobile system for adult
basic skills in which learners access content and
discussion transparently across a range of
mobile and computing devices. For any
commercial exploitation, it is necessary to
explore and assess the factors that determine
the various developmental efforts and their
respective educational benefits. This paper
suggests a way to integrate and apply work on
multimedia educational software cost-estimation,
cost models of networked learning, the Laurillard
conversational framework and blended learning
development tools. These factors must underpin
any objective economic evaluation of mobile
learning and establish the foundations for
understanding  the  basis  of  commercial
exploitation.

Keywords:  cost–benefit,  software  cost-
estimation, conversational framework, media-
mix

1. Introduction

Mobile learning is currently at a stage of
small-scale projects working to establish aspects
of technical feasibility in specific educational
subjects  and  settings.  The  EU  m-learning
project,¹ coordinated by the Learning and Skills
Development Agency, and the EU MOBIlearn²
project are two exceptions to this European

generalisation. In North America – for example
the University of South Dakota³ – and perhaps
the Far East – for example at the Kinjo Gakuin
University in Japan⁴ – mobile learning, or at
least learning with mobile devices, is breaking
through to some visibility at an institutional
level.

If  these  projects  are  educationally  and
technically successful and act as the focus for a
consensus  of  what  in  practice  constitutes
mobile learning, the next phase must be large-
scale social or institutional use and commercial
exploitation. This may not necessarily take the
form of direct free-market commercialisation but
instead may involve publicly funded support
within  government  initiatives  and  ongoing
provision. Whichever is the case, exploitation
will only take place on a sustainable basis if
there  is  an  understanding  of  the  relations
between the costs of mobile learning, in all their
different  forms,  and  the  educational,  and
perhaps social, benefits. Hence, commercial
exploitation  is  a  question  of  educational
cost–benefit analysis and in particular that part
of educational cost–benefit analysis that deals
with large-scale or industrialised educational
systems explored, for example, by Rumble
(1997) and Peters (1998). Subsequent work on
costs  has  looked  at  specific  settings,  for
example  information  and  communications
technology (ICT) (Nicol and Coen 2003) and
networked learning (Bacsich et al. 1999) within
the confines of conventional universities. Other
work  has  looked  at  cost-effectiveness  with
computer-aided learning (CAL) materials (Hunt



and Clarke 1997). All this work is characterised
by differing definitions of the system boundary
and by differing attention to the various portions
of the lifecycle from conception via delivery and
operation to revision and maintenance. There is
also the recurrent difficulty of identifying and

setting tangible costs against intangible
educational benefits. This paper looks at mobile
learning as a system composed of system-
specific content and  human teaching and
support. Moving the system  boundary, for
example to situate mobile learning within an
institutional setting, would create a different
analysis.

However, mobile learning is a technical
system with significant computing components
and much can learned by looking at the
literature of software engineering, especially
software cost-estimation and project

management, summarised in Pressman (2000)

and Sommerville (1992).

Implicit in the following analysis is the
proposition that the cost of developing and
deploying mobile learning systems can  be
broken down into:

•content development costs

• teaching costs

•software development costs

•  hardware costs

•usage costs, eg phone charges.

This assumes that a mobile learning system is a
reusable generic shell and that new content can
be developed and delivered as and when
needed. The declining real costs of mass-
produced hardware such as PDAs and mobile
phones, the artificiality of phone tariffs and the
economies of scale associated with commercial
exploitation will mean that it is the first two
elements that will be the decisive determinants
of mobile learning costs.

2. Software cost estimation

For commercial and industrial software
developers, there  has always  been a

considerable economic advantage in being able
to predict and control the effort and thus the cost
of software development. This opening section
looks at methods for predicting the effort and
hence cost of developing programs.

Over the last three decades, a variety of
predictive methods have been devised and
tested, based on a variety of assumptions and
principles. One of the most effective has been
Constructive Cost Modelling (COCOMO),
devised   by Barry Boehm (1981). This looks at a
program specification – a description of what the
proposed piece of software should actually do –
and analyses it to generate some indicator or
metric of program size. This metric might be the

anticipated eventual size of the program (KLOC

– kilo lines-of-code) or the extent of its
functionality (FP – function points). From these
it     is possible to calculate effort, as person-
months, and duration, as months, and hence
the size of the development team, as ‘persons’.
Unfortunately, COCOMO in its basic form
requires   some subjective judgements about the
nature of the development team and about the
nature of the proposed software and so the
method is less analytic and mechanical than it
at  first seems. In this basic form, it is also less
exact than would be desirable. Subsequent
versions of COCOMO developed by Boehm
(1996, 2000) attempted to add sensitivity by
introducing the idea of ‘cost-drivers’. These
were environmental and technical factors,
attributes of the project such as its tools and
methods, attributes of the personnel such as
their capability and experience, attributes of the
target hardware such as its performance and
memory and attributes of the product such as
reliability and complexity. These were all scored
for  a proposed development and put into the
appropriate equations to give the effort,
duration   and staffing of a project and hence its
cost.

The argument being made in this section is
implicitly that the appropriate analogy for the
development of educational software, for
example mobile learning material, is that of the
mainstream software engineering project. This
may  not  be  the  case. There  are  other
possibilities, for example the development of
mass-market retail software described  by
Cusamano and Selby (1996).

If educational software development is tied to
a specific development methodology, for
example the Dynamic Systems Development
Method  (DSDM)  (Boyle 1997) or structured
methods (Stoner 1996), then perhaps more
accurate but less transferable predictions are
possible.

3. Educational effort estimation

This section looks at an application of
software cost-estimation techniques to
educational software and identifies the
underlying characteristics of multimedia

educational packages that drive educational
software development costs upwards or
downwards. This is the work of Dr Ian Marshall
and   his collaborators at the University of
Abertay (1995a, 1995b). These characteristics
are fundamental to different conceptions of

teaching and learning, and are shared by many
components of mobile learning systems.

Marshall’s work used COCOMO on 14
projects in the 1990s, mainly with a nominal



learner time of an hour. It tested four possible
cost-drivers:

•  course difficulty

•  development expertise

•  subject expertise

•  interactivity.

These were further sub-divided into 24 sub-
headings. His results showed the significant
cost-drivers to be:

•  development environment:

oinstructional design method

osize of developer team
opowerful development tools
o methodology

•  course difficulty:

onumber of objectives

olevel of objectives

oexisting course material.

Interactivity was not strongly indicated in the
results. The implications, for example, for the m-
learning project and its development costs are
clear. Costs are driven down for packages with
fewer objectives, for objectives that are at a
lower  level  or  based  on  existing  material
developed using powerful development tools
with superior design methods.

4.  Analysing mobile learning – the
Conversational Framework

The previous section identified potential ‘cost-
drivers’ for the didactic components of mobile
learning  systems,  or  rather,  their  discrete
didactic software components. It was, however,
an  incomplete  account  of  mobile  learning
economics because it failed to address other
components of such systems and their probable
synergy. It also failed to address the educational
effectiveness  or  efficiency  of  the  various
components. This section will look at a more
general  framework  developed  by  Laurillard
(1993a)  that  allows  us  to  categorise  and
understand the activities within mobile learning.
Laurillard’s  analysis  of  learning  draws  on
constructivism and on the view that teaching and
learning is based around ‘conversations’ or
exchanges between two different types of world,
the  discursive  and  interior  mental  world  of
descriptions and conceptions and the interactive
and exterior physical world of action. For any
given individual these are linked by reflection
and  adaptation.  These  worlds  can  also  be
divided into those of teachers and those of
learners. Their interior worlds communicate by
articulation and re-articulation as concepts are
defined and refined, while their exterior worlds
communicate  by  action  and  feedback  as
learners learn experientially from environments
created by teachers.

Laurillard (1993b) gives this explanation of
the Conversational Framework background:

the characterisation of the teaching-
learning process as a conversation is hardly
new.  Gordon  Pask  formalised  it  as
'conversation theory' some time ago (Pask
1976), including the separation of 'descriptions'
and 'model-building behaviours', and the
definition of understanding as ‘determined
by a two level of agreement’. Vygotsky
described  learning  in  terms  of  social
interaction (Vygotsky 1962).

The  framework  was  used  in  examining
educational television (Laurillard 1993b) and
computer-aided learning (Laurillard 1987). It is
most often used to explore the adequacy and
coverage of strategies (Britain and Liber 1999)
in proposed HE courses or classes and is
sometimes extended with a representation of
learner-to-learner exchanges supporting social
learning.

Print, lectures and web pages appear as an
unidirectional broadcast from the conceptual
world of the teacher to the conceptual world of
the  learner;  seminars  as  a  bi-directional
exchange  between  the  same  worlds.  In
fieldwork and simulations, there is bi-directional
exchange between the two worlds of practice or
action, and perhaps reflection will then inform
the  learner’s  world  of  conception.  Virtual
learning environments (VLEs) and now mobile
learning offer greater diversity and richness of
exchanges since they embrace a range of
constituent technologies. It is instructive to
evaluate the coverage of the proposed mobile
learning system  against  the  full  Laurillard
framework.

Laurillard herself (Laurillard 2002) says that
the framework has not yet been used outside
British higher education and so an extension
into adult basic skills would be an exciting
innovation.  Nevertheless,  the  framework
provides  a basis for widening the work of
Marshall (who in Laurillard’s terms only tackles
didactic  or  broadcast  exchanges  or
conversations) since in theory one could look
for     the costs and then the cost-drivers
associated with each form of exchange. An
analysis along these lines would undoubtedly
be helpful but not complete since it would
ignore some major issues including:

•longevity of content and material

•individual learning styles

•economies of scale

•  relationships between creation,
maintenance and delivery

•  subject matter

o suitability

o volatility, changeability.



A detailed examination of any commercial
exploitation of mobile learning would have to
address these factors. Much of the content
might seek to use topicality to capture learners’
interest. In purely economic terms, this may be a
costly strategy but a more thorough analysis
would need to balance the short lifetime of
topical content with its enhanced effectiveness
with  learners.  Similarly,  dealing  with  the
multiplicity of anticipated learning styles would
be very expensive since it would entail the
techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) but more
pragmatic and procedural solutions might prove
cost-effective, especially if the delicacy of myriad
learning styles were in any case masked by the
constraints and peculiarities of mobile learning
technologies and interfaces.

5. Using  the  Conversational
Framework – Media Adviser and
CRAM

The previous section provided a theoretical
model for discussing the costs and choices
involved in developing a mobile learning system.
This section looks at two current attempts to
combine Laurillard’s conversational framework
with data relating to a range of developmental
activities. They provide examples of how an
economic analysis of mobile learning might
proceed. This is a significant step towards a
transparent procedure for optimising the
elements used within a teaching system and a
considerable improvement on the pragmatic
‘media-mix’ solutions of Reisner and Gagne
(1983) which lacked flexibility or any obvious
theoretical basis.

One of these attempts is institutional, the
other individual, neither is ever likely to reach
maturity or widespread use but nevertheless
both show how the basic principles can be
carried forward and possibly applied to mobile
learning.

The  Course  Resource  Appraisal  Model
(CRAM) was developed by the Open University
(OU) for internal resource management. It is
implemented  as  an  Excel  spreadsheet  and
assists course development teams in exploring
the resource implications, early on, of their
various  learning  technology  options.  Their
system starts from the required overall study
time, usually the OU norms for 15-credit and 30-
credit courses. It uses historical institutional OU
figures for academic and production activity
(graphic design, editing, etc) dating back to the
mid-1990s  which  were  never  updated.  The
multimedia development times, for example,
were based on data from developing a first-year
science course. The intended outputs are the
person-hours across the various skills and tasks

for  a  range  of  technology  options.  The
parameters are manually adjustable.

The CRAM tool is intended as guidance for
individuals leading multidisciplinary production
teams including designers, developers, authors
and others. As such, it deals only with average
figures for cost and productivity. Interestingly, it
does attempt to allow for the increasing cost
associated with the complexity of using larger
numbers of technology options.

The drawbacks of the CRAM tool are that it
does not deal with any issues of economies of
scale, nor include longevity of material or the
educational efficiency of specific media as
factors in the cost-benefit equation. There are
probably problems unpacking the CRAM data
for computer-mediated conferencing (CMC)
because it deals with several different teaching
formats, especially as the OU is tied closely to
one specific commercial system, and with VLEs
for similar reasons.

The tool has not been used widely within the
OU, partly because of user resistance (it is
perceived as a management tool), and it is
unlikely it will receive much further investment,
development or promotion.

The Media Adviser tool (Conole and Oliver
1999) developed by Grainne Conole, Martin
Oliver and others at the University of North
London as part of the Learning and Teaching
Innovation and Development (LATiD) project
simplifies Laurillard’s conversations down to:

•  delivery

•  discussion

•  activity

•  feedback.

It covers a range of contemporary media that
users can customise, adding their own. For
each medium, the Media Selector section of the
tool provides default data about:

•search and evaluation time (in hours)

•familiarisation and preparation time

•cost (pounds sterling)

•delivery resources (hardware, software,
etc)

and so on for existing materials or media. For
new materials, it provides for:

•development time (in hours)

•  development  resources  (hardware,
software, etc).

This provides a simple database of learning
technologies. The Media Rater section allows
users to rate media in terms of their support,
that is their suitability and effectiveness, for
each of the four types of conversation in the
interests of creating a balanced course. Then
the  Course  Modeller  section  estimates
development costs, both effort and expenditure,



based on the user’s preferred balance and
ratings.

This simple tool is intended as the focus for
staff development and reflective practice in
higher education. Perhaps it should not be taken
too  seriously  as  an  objective  analytic  tool.
Nevertheless,  it  may  express  some  useful
principles and procedures that could underpin
the  development  of  tools  to  predict  mobile
learning economics. In particular, it allows for
the  cumulative  capture  and  refinement  of
experience.

One common feature of all forms of effort and
cost estimation is the need for stability and
measurement.  Although  theory  provides
preliminary  estimates,  these  become
progressively more useful and accurate only if
they  are  refined  in  the  light  of  continued
monitoring in a stable development environment.

6. Human factors

This section looks briefly at the factors that
complicate  this  apparently  rational  and
systematic analysis of the economics of mobile
learning, namely the preferences, attitudes and
behaviour of teachers and learners, and how
they are currently manifest in e-learning.

The current m-learning project is clearly tied
to the adult basic skills curriculum. There are
many subject areas where mobile learning is
impossible, however attractive it might be on
cost grounds. These include subjects and
courses with elements that are:

•hands-on, eg music-making

•  in vivo, eg ‘wet’ biology, practical dentistry
and so on

•interpersonal, eg interview skills

•social, eg team work, marketing

•expressive, eg ballet, dance.

There are others, as well as many exam and

assessment situations, where computer-based
learning of any sort is inappropriate. In addition,
the time and cost elements borne by the
learners themselves might be unacceptable
without public subsidy (which might have to
include setting up, maintaining and supporting
systems in use).

Another constraint on deploying the most
cost-effective technologies is learner resistance
and preference. The subjects of one survey –
though they are not identified as coming from
the m-learning project target groups – show
clear preferences for books, lectures and videos
over computers as their preferred learning tools
(Daniel 1996). Unpublished survey results from
LSDA make the opposite case for potential m-
learning learners and indicate a remarkably high
preference for mobile phones, though not yet for
PDAs as the medium for communication and
learning.

Another aspect of learner behaviour that
might constrain discursive, though not didactic,
mobile learning is the reluctance of learners to
engage actively within the chat, forum and
discussion  facilities  of  computer-mediated
conferencing. Informal surveys on mailbases
such as those of the Joint Information Services
Committee (JISC) suggest that from 10% to
40%  of  learners  ‘lurk’  without  actively
participating  and  that  for  online  learning
considerable skill and effort (and hence, cost)
are required on the part of tutors to convert
these ‘lurkers’ into active users (Salmon 2000).
These skills must be adapted and costed before
they can be used in mobile learning.

7. Conclusion

This paper has identified elements of a
theoretical basis for estimating and predicting
the effectiveness, efficiency and economics of
mobile learning. It also shows that even at this
early stage of implementation, it is possible to
identify those procedures likely to enhance the
efficiency of any commercial exploitation of
mobile  learning.  Increased  exploitation  will
improve on any early estimates and refine any
procedures.

Abstract

In our study we present a critical approach to
usability  issues  and  usability  evaluation
particularly involving adaptive user interface
design for mobile learning environments. We
describe some design challenges for adaptive
user interfaces and key usability issues in the
MOBIlearn project. In addition, we compare
these  challenges  in  three  different  learning
contexts.

Our  hypothesis  is  that  the  concept  of
‘learning’ is not clearly defined in most usability
studies. Additionally, the influences of different
learning contexts are not considered enough in
usability evaluation. Our aim is to develop
mobile systems that are adaptable to more than
one learning context.

Keywords: adaptive user interface, usability,
learning context

1.  Introduction:  user  interface
design in the MOBIlearn project

MOBIlearn is a EU IST research project
focused  on  next-generation  paradigms  and
interfaces for technology-supported learning in a
mobile environment exploring the potential of
ambient intelligence. By ambient intelligence we
mean digital environments in which applications
are  sensitive  to  users’  needs  and  to  their
requirements and behaviour.

This paper introduces one approach to a
user interface design in the MOBIlearn project,
eg adaptive human interface design. Our work
aims to design user interfaces that take account
of different kind of users, contexts, content and
devices.

In the MOBIlearn project results are verified
with real users in field trials involving:

•  ‘blended  learning’  (enhancing  formal
courses)

• ‘adventitious, location-dependent learning’
(during visits to museums)

• ‘learning to interpret information sources
and advice’ (acquiring medical information for
everyday needs) (MOBIlearn 2003).

In our opinion, usability design should aim to
support all these three types of learning and
user activity within the same adaptive mobile
learning environments. In a sense the learning
itself is different in each of these contexts: the
first is focused on blended, formal learning, the
second more on informal learning and the last
on lifelong learning. For that reason, learner
and context modelling are the primary concerns
in  our  usability  and  user  interface  design
process. We try to avoid building three totally
different user interfaces, instead providing the
user with different navigation alternatives and
levels of discovery. De Carolis et al. (2001)
state that adapting information presentation to
the  users  is  not  enough;  besides  their
experience, information needs, interests and so
on, other features have to be considered.
These features include users’ location, the
activity  in  which  they  are  involved,  their



emotional  state  and,  finally,  the  technical
characteristics of the device they are using. This
information about the ‘user in context’ can be
employed  to  contextualise  the  way  the
information is accessed and presented.

In the MOBIlearn project the context issues
are  well  addressed.  The  University  of
Birmingham is working closely with us (the
University of Tampere) and they have focused
on building a context-awareness subsystem
(CAS). In broad terms, the aim of the CAS is to
provide a means by which users of mobile
devices can maintain their attention on the world
around or the task at hand, while the mobile
devices provide timely and effective computer
support (Lonsdale et al. 2003).

The user interface design challenges in our
research  are  strongly  connected  to  those
mentioned by de Carolis et al. (2001): which
type of navigation through the hypermedia (free
or  guided);  what  kind  of  structure  (linear,
hierarchical  or  circular);  and  what  level  of
orientation support should be provided for users.
Context-awareness information is needed to
make this kind of decision and to support users’
activities.

2.  Adaptation, adaptability – a user
model in focus

Studies of web-based educational systems
and mobile learning environments have recently
started to focus on systems described as
adaptive. Adaptive systems can be seen as an
alternative to the ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach
(Brusilowsky et al. 2000). An adaptive user
interface can be defined as ‘a software artefact
that improves its ability to interact with a user by
constructing a user model based on partial
experience with that user’ (Langley 1999). The
term adaptation refers to a system’s capacity to
change its behaviour dynamically to keep the
quality of service above a certain level. In many
cases adaptation is seen as a part of context-
awareness in mobile applications and systems.
Adaptivity refers to a system that adapts itself
according to the user. Furthermore, adaptability
refers to a system where the users have to
change the system behaviour. Adaptive user
interfaces can be focused on, for example,
information  or  content-based  filtering,
recommendation, social or collaborative filtering,
or   optimising (Langley 1999).

Recent studies have stated that adaptable
features, such as tools for adapting the user
interface, are not often used by novice users

and are used only to a limited degree by
experienced users. One reason for that is the
cognitive load these features cause for the
users. This could keep them away from their
main task, which in the MOBIlearn project, is
learning.  Since  the  learning  systems  with
mobile devices are expected to be used for the
short-term, we argued that it might be better let
the system adapt itself (adaptivity) to the user
rather than forcing the users to change the
system behaviour (adaptability).

Design of adaptive human interfaces is
based on assumptions of a user’s behaviour
which are then used to form a theoretical
model. A user model describes what is known
about the user and user’s interest (Patamaa et
al. 2001). In mobile learning applications, such
as those in the MOBIlearn project, definitions of
the user models are the most challenging ones.

For example, the user’s interest can be
classified as a short-term interest such as a
current task, a long-term interest which is stable
such as work, a hobby or a learning path, or a
hybrid interest, which is both of these. What the
user  already  knows  is  also  important
concerning,  for  example,  new  information
(Macskassy et al. 2002.). User models can be
based on the distinction of novice and expert
users, device, screen layout, and interaction
technique preferences (Sukaviriya and Foley
1993).

3.  Adaptation and adaptability as a
part of usability

We see adaptive user interface design as a
vital part of the usability design of an application
or a service. Usability can be seen as a relative
issue in many different ways. Acceptance by
end users of an application can be seen as a
primary goal of interactive systems design. A
simple model of system acceptability consists of
social acceptability and practical acceptability.
Social acceptability refers to system features’
acceptability in cultural and social contexts.
Practical acceptability can be analysed within
various  categories  such  as  cost,  support,
reliability,  compatibility  and  usefulness.
(Shackel 1991).

Usefulness  is  defined  as  the  ability  to
achieve a goal by using the system. Usefulness
can be divided into utility and usability. Utility
refers to the functionality of a system, and
usability to the ability to make use of that
functionality (Nielsen 1995).



The usability of a system is determined by the
usability of both the underlying system engine
and the contents and structure of the information
base. Usability has been associated with five
attributes: ease of learning, efficiency, easy to
remember,  consistency  (few  errors)  and
pleasantness of use (Nielsen 1995).

In user-adaptive systems there are several
key issues to be resolved in the design of such
systems. Jameson (2001) argues that the
following issues are essential and common.

1. What functions are to be served by the
adaptation?

2. What properties of the user should be
modelled?

3. What input data about the user should be
obtained?

4. What techniques should be employed to
make inferences about the user?

5. How should decisions about appropriate
adaptive system behaviour be made?

6.  What  empirical  studies  should  be
conducted?

Furthermore, in mobile learning environments
adaptive user interfaces should support lifelong,
informal learning. We mentioned earlier the
focus of the MOBIlearn project on informal
learning. When learning takes place over a long
time, the learner’s abilities and skills will change
gradually. To adapt to a learner’s changing skills
and knowledge, the system must be able to
maintain a profile or model of the learner that
can determine the way in which the accumulated
knowledge and learning material are stored and
then presented back to the learner in new
contexts. (Sharples et al. 2002).

4.  Critical voices

Some criticism of user adaptive systems and
user profiles has already appeared. According to
Piomo et al. (2000), in existing web-based
education environments a student profile has
been taken into consideration and some
common features are encountered such as initial
level of knowledge and learning objectives. Few
systems have considered cognitive aspects
when student profiles are modelled.

We argue that the learning contexts, which
are based on usability design including adaptive
user interface design and adaptive system
design, should be defined more clearly.
Furthermore, we argue that in traditional
usability testing the long-term usage is
underestimated.

Some recent  studies argue that  current
adaptive (hypermedia) systems are based on ‘a
stereotypical user model with limited levels of
user differentiation’  and  some  additional
research is suggested in the evaluation of the
educational effectiveness of system adaptation
(Triantafillou et al. 2002).

The psychological effects of an interface
adaptation on user performance have also been
studied. Two competing possible effects of
using adaptive user interfaces can be found:
social facilitation and ‘chocking’. The former
refers to consequences that occur because the
user performance is monitored by the interface.
The latter, ‘chocking’, refers to consequences
caused by the interface, which adapts to a
user’s performance (Jettmar and Nass 2002).

5. Conclusions and future work

In our study we examined examples of
existing  adaptive  user  interface  design
practices and some key usability issues. Our
aim is to develop usability of adaptive user
interfaces in mobile learning systems that adapt
to the user’s changing needs over a long time.

Usability focuses on making applications
easy for people to use. Accessibility on the
other hand focuses on making applications
equally easy for everyone to use, including
people  with  a  disability.  This  kind  of
accessibility view often focuses on areas like
multi-modality and material conversions. In the
context   of mobile collaboration, access and
accessibility are often more essential issues
than  ease of use (Ahonen 2003).

As the importance of informal learning in a
mobile context has been recognised, there has
been research on systems that support a
person’s everyday learning over a lifetime.

Vavoula and Sharples (2002) have inspected
learning episodes and personal learning
projects, and have developed the following
criteria for lifelong learning organisers (LLOs):
LLOs should be available and functional any
time, during any day of the week.

To  us  these  kinds  of  accessibility
requirements mean that adaptation logic is
integrated into the device and its software, not
only based on the hyperlinking structure or
user’s profile on a server. Adaptation in future
studies may need to be inspected in the context
of learning agents and artificial intelligence.



However, agents pose some new user interface
design considerations like understanding, trust,
control, distraction and personification
(Wexelblat and Maes 2003).

We will continue our work in the MOBIlearn
project by providing some guidelines for
adaptive user interface design. Furthermore, we
will study some design challenges of mobile
learning architecture and related adaptivity and
accessibility themes.

Abstract

In this paper we introduce the idea of enhancing
the audio presentation of a multimedia museum
guide by using the personal digital assistant
(PDA) screen to travel throughout a fresco and
identify the various details in it. During the
presentation, a sequence of pictures is
synchronised with the audio commentary and
the transitions between the pictures are planned
according to cinematic techniques. Preliminary
studies and pilot tests show encouraging results
and interesting effects. The use of cinematic
techniques in the audio guide seems to help
users better understand and localise the fresco’s
details, while the localisation mechanism
employed in the museum allowed them quickly
to identify the panel of the fresco referred to in
the audio.

Keywords:  multimedia  museum  guides,
cinematography

1. Introduction

Many research projects are exploring the new
possibilities offered by personal digital assistants
(PDAs)  in  a  museum  setting  (for  example,
Grinter et al. 2002; Cheverst et al. 2000). These
projects usually have multimedia guides that use
static images, while others employ pre-recorded,
short video clips about museum exhibits. In
previous work (Not et al. 1998), we explored
different techniques for automatically building
location-aware multimedia presentations in a
museum setting. The advent of more powerful
devices  since  has  allowed  researchers  to
experiment with new forms of multimedia, in
particular time-based media such as animations.

In this paper we introduce the idea of
enhancing an audio presentation (dynamically

assembled  pre-recorded  or  synthesised
speech) of a complex fresco by using the PDA
screen to travel throughout the fresco itself and
identify various details in it. Our hypothesis is
that this type of animation used to present the
description of a painting allows the visitor to
identify the details introduced by the audio
counterpart  to  the  presentation  more
accurately. In this manner, the system becomes
both more effective and more satisfying
(Nielsen 1994), while also providing an
enhanced learning experience for the visitor. At
present, we have completed a first prototype for
the famous 15th-century fresco ‘The cycle of
the months’ at Torre Aquila in Trento, Italy. This
fresco illustrates the lives and activities of
aristocrats and peasants throughout the year,
and covers all four walls of a tower. The
numerous characters introduced throughout the
fresco are seen harvesting wine, hunting with
falcons and generally occupied in medieval
activities.

A web-based demo of the prototype is
available at: http://peach.itc.it/preview.html

2. Rhetorical Structure Theory

Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann
and Thompson 1987) analyses discourse
structure in terms of dependency trees, with
each node of the tree being a segment of text.
Each branch of the tree represents the
relationship between the two nodes, where one
node   is called the ‘nucleus’ and the other is
called the ‘satellite’. The information in the
satellite relates to that found in the nucleus in
that it expresses an idea related to what was
said in the nucleus.  This rhetorical relation
between  them  specifies  the  relation  of
coherence which exists between the two
portions of text contained in the nodes. For


example, a Cause rhetorical relation holds true
when the satellite describes the cause of the
event contained in the nucleus. In the original
formulation by Mann and Thompson (1987), the
theory posited 20 different rhetorical relations
between a satellite and a nucleus, while other
scholars have since added to this theory.


RST was originally developed as part of the
work carried out in the computer-based text
generation field. A previous article (Not and
Zancanaro 2001) described a set of techniques
that   dynamically   compose   adaptive
presentations of artworks from a repository of
multimedia  data  annotated  with  rhetorical
relations.  These  techniques  have  been
employed in an audio-based, location-aware
adaptive audio guide described in Not et al.
(1998). The audio commentaries produced by
that audio guide were automatically annotated
with  the  rhetorical  structure.  We  are  now
investigating  a  system  that  automatically
composes  video  clips  out  of  these  audio
commentaries (Rocchi and Zancanaro 2003).

For our current work, we used RST to inform
the design of our cinematic presentations and
organise the various scenes that composed
each video clip in accordance with the logical
model that exists in dialogue. RST provided us
with the blueprint for a better analysis of the
audio presentations and thus construction of the
video counterparts. In the next section we will
discuss how this information can be used to
create more effective video clips to accompany
the commentary.

3. Cinematic presentations

The language of cinematography, including
shot segmentation, camera movements and
transition effects, is employed to plan the
animation and to synchronise the visual and the
verbal parts of the presentation (Metz 1974).

In building the animations, a set of strategies
similar to those used in documentaries were
thus employed. Two broad classes of strategies
have been identified. The first class of strategy
encompasses constraints imposed by the
grammar  of cinematography, while the second
deals with conventions usually used in guiding
camera movements in the production of
documentaries. For instance, a strategy in the
first   class would discourage a zoom-in facility
immediately followed by a zoom-out facility,
while   a strategy in the second class would
recommend the use of sequential scene cuts,
rather than a fade-out effect, to enumerate
different characters in a scene visually.

Figure 1. Screen of mobile device

To have a more engaging presentation, the
visual part should not only focus on the right detail
at the right time, but it should also support the
presentation  of  new  audio  information  by
illustrating its relation to information that has been
already given. In this manner, continuity between
the pieces of information is built, which in turn
facilitates the viewing of the video clip while
stimulating the absorption of new information.

For strategies in the second class, it is often
necessary to make reference to the discourse
structure of the audio part of the presentation,
such as enumeration of properties, background
knowledge and elaboration of related information.

For example, consider an audio commentary
describing a detail of the fresco, such as:

At the bottom on the right is a blacksmith’s
workshop, a plebeian antithesis to the
tournament going on in the upper part of the
painting. The choice of the tournament for the
month of February is related to the jousts that
took place during carnival.

The two sentences are linked by a rhetorical
relation of type Elaboration since the second
sentence further elaborates the topic introduced
by  the first. This commentary can be visually
represented with two shots of the same image
(that  is, the tournament) linked by a long cross
fade. Technically, having two shots is not
necessary, since the image is the same, but the
cross fade helps the user understand that
background information is going to be provided.
The  first image is thus presented while the first
paragraph is heard over the audio, then when
the audio switches to, in this case, the
background information, the image is enlarged
to  cover the entire panel and finally refocused
on the detail once the audio has stopped.



4. Mobile presentations

The guide was implemented on a PDA that by
means of infra-red sensors is capable of
identifying its position within the frescoed tower
of   the castle. Interaction with the system is both
proposed by the system itself, and accepted by
the user, thus sharing the responsibility of
information access. When the system detects
that the visitor is in front of one of the four walls,
a picture of that wall is displayed on the PDA
and, after a moment, if the user has not changed
position, the panel is highlighted (see Figure 2).
At this point, the visitor can click on the panel
and receive a multimedia presentation of the
chosen panel .

As one infra-red was placed in front of each
panel, the visitor needed only to be within an
approximately two-metre range of the infra-red
to  connect  with  the  sensor.  Given  the
characteristics of the tower, each panel was
clearly separated and while the sensors took a
moment or two to activate the system, we did
not experience any accuracy problems.

This modality for localisation was chosen to
allow the visitor to retain control of an inherently
proactive guide.

5. Evaluation

Preliminary studies and pilot tests indicate
encouraging results and interesting effects.

It was found that all users became acquainted

small details on the fresco with the help of the
PDA. This demonstrates that use of cinematic
techniques  in  a  multimedia  guide  can  be
effective,  particularly  when  explaining  a
complex painting.

A formal study started in May 2003 in Torre
Aquila  and  will  involve  approximately  60
subjects.  The  purpose  of  the  study  is  to
investigate the correlation between rhetorical
devices and the visual attention of the guide
user. We will study how the application of the
rhetorical transitions described above affect the
users’ attention by observing the patterns of
eye movements to and from the fresco and the
guide.

5.1. Subjective evaluation: preliminary
results

As the study is still in progress we have to
date only analysed the subjective evaluation of
the first 30 participants.

The age of the participants ranges from 21 to
64 years with the average age being 37.1 years
(standard deviation 43.7 years). Of these 14 are
male and 16 female; 20% have had a primary
school education, 47% a college education and
33% a university degree. Self-declared previous
knowledge of the tower in the fresco is evenly
distributed between no knowledge at all and a
very good knowledge.

After a short training phase, participants
interact freely with the mobile multimedia guide
in Torre Aquila and, when finished, are asked to
fill out a questionnaire about the experience.
The questionnaire is composed of 21
statements with which the participants have to
express their agreement using 10- and 5-point
Likert scales.

The most interesting aspect to emerge so far
from the analysis regards the role of the
cinematic techniques.

In the statement ‘The videos helped me to
better understand the fresco’s details’, it was
found that 76.7% of participants totally agreed
with this statement (see Figure 3).


with the system very quickly. The main limitation
with using infra-red beamers as a localisation
technology is their directionality, that is, the user
must face the beamer to be localised. Most of
the visitors, however, overcome this limitation by
naturally using the PDA as a type of remote
control, pointing it directly at the infra-red
emitters to speed up the localisation.

usefulness of the cinematography (ie the
correlation is -0.592, with a significance level of

will be further analysed with the objective
