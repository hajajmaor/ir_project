AbIsNtrTaRctODUCTION: A wide variety and an increasing amount of exhibit 
information is often overwhelming for
the museum ubiquitous visitors.

OBJECTIVES: In this work, we propose the organization of museum exhibit 
information to mitigate the
information overloading problem of the ubiquitous visitors.

METHODS: The Introductory Attributes (IA), Functional/Behavioral Attributes 
(F/BA), and Descriptive Attributes
(DA) which broadly characterize the museum exhibit information are organized as 
essential and further as
elaborated information at the levels of school kids, college students, and 
professionals ubiquitous visitors.

RESULTS: The results show that the museum exhibit information organization time 
and the size of the
organized information increases with the increase in the understanding levels 
of the ubiquitous visitors.

CONCLUSION: The organization of Swami Vivekananda exhibit information indicates 
an example of catering
information for the individual requirements of museum ubiquitous visitors.

The increasing capacity of museum archives has led
to the availability of a large amount of exhibit
information. However, from a large amount of exhibit
information, mostly a small fraction of information
segments might be relevant for the ubiquitous visitors
[1–5]. Museum ubiquitous visitors are the visitors who
need anywhere, anytime exhibit information according
to their individual requirements without any requests
or interventions. Thus, providing exhibit information
as available from the original sources may lead to
offer the same information to the ubiquitous visitors,
despite the fact that their individual requirements
such as levels of understandings, interests, etc., are
different [6–10]. In other words, museum ubiquitous
visitors may have different information need [11,
12]. Even with such individual requirements of the

ubiquitous visitors, accordingly, the organization of
museum exhibit information is not widely discussed.
Indeed, from the perspectives of the ubiquitous visitors,
organization of exhibit information is useful for both:

(i) To alleviate the information overloading problem for
the ubiquitous visitors by filtering and managing a large
amount of information at different levels; (ii) To provide
the most significant exhibit information pertaining to
the individual requirements of the museum ubiquitous
visitors.

This paper presents the organization of museum
exhibit information to cater to the individual needs
of the ubiquitous visitors. We organize the museum
exhibit information as essential information and further
as elaborated information at the levels of school
kids, college students, and professionals ubiquitous

  visitors, respectively. The Introductory Attributes (IA),

Attributes (DA) which broadly characterize the exhibit
information are identified and used to organize the
exhibit information. The organized museum exhibit
information is maintained at respective URLs to
dynamically cater to the individual requirements of
the ubiquitous visitors. We present an example of
organization of Swami Vivekananda exhibit information.
The simulation results show that the museum exhibit
information organization time and the size of the
organized information increase with the increase in the
understanding levels of the ubiquitous visitors.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses some of the related work. Section 3
presents the organization layout of the museum exhibit
information. Section 4 provides an example of the
organization of Swami Vivekananda Exhibit Information
at   the level of school kids, college students, and
professionals ubiquitous visitors. Section 5 presents
the simulation results followed by the conclusion and
future work in Section 6.

Providing exhibit information museum services to the
ubiquitous visitors introduces new challenges in the
organization of exhibit information [6, 7, 12–23]. The
key points of concern here are: (i) Maintain the focus
of attention of museum ubiquitous visitors and to
avoid distractions through information overloading

(ii) Provide exhibit information according to the
individual requirements of the museum ubiquitous
visitors. Katz et al. [6] have presented a methodological
approach to design museum presentations in PEACH
and PIL projects [7, 8]. For the organization of
exhibit information, the whole exhibition, its objects,
objectives, and the visitor interested information are
considered. Nine steps are used to prepare museum
presentation: (i) Finding the main idea of the exhibition

(ii) Recording exhibits (iii) Defining fields of interests

(iv) Searching and selecting source text (v) Writing text
(spoken language) (vi) Choosing images (vii) Selection
of cinematographic techniques (viii) Audio generation

(ix) Synchronizing audio and images. These steps are
used to support museum visitors to obtain museum
presentations at their own pace and knowledge level.

MacroNode approach [15] is developed within
HyperAudio [24] and HIPS [20] project to dynamically
compose the adaptive hypermedia for the museum.
The available information is divided into content
units (called Macronodes) which are annotated with
the required descriptions. The annotations provide
an explanation of the main topic of macronodes and
the rhetorical relations exists with the other nodes.
At the time of interaction of the visitors, the system

dynamically designs the nodes of hypermedia with
varied pieces of information using rule-based mecha-
nism which encodes strategies according to the user
model and the domain model. For textual informa-
tion, macronode is considered as paragraphs. Moreover,
macronode may represent data from different media
such as text, audio, images, or any of these combina-
tions.

In [13], effective levels of adaptation support are
discussed for the different types of visitors during
navigation of museum information. The adaptation
support is discussed for: Presentation, where different
types of media, layout and the attributes of the
perceived components are considered; Information,
where a change in the information content of the same
topic for a different type of visitors are considered;
Navigation, where different links to different locations
and modalities are considered. In [25], four components
are discussed to improve visitor’s museum experience
which includes information representations, modeling
visitors, matching visitors and content, and providing
content to the visitors. These components enable to
provide exhibit information according to the individual
requirements of the museum visitors.

M-PIRO (Multilingual personalized information
objects) [26, 27] project is designed to provide
automatic multilingual textual and spoken descriptions
of exhibits. The descriptions are generated in several
languages and are tailored to the visitor’s backgrounds,
ages, and their past interaction with the system. The
techniques related to the field of natural language
generation, user modeling, and speech synthesis are
used  to develop the information about the exhibits,
which is stored in the database to present over the Web.
M-PIRO extends ILEX’s and HIPS [20, 28] technology
by incorporating enhanced multilingual capabilities,
higher quality speech output, modular core generation
engine, and extended user modeling mechanisms. M-
PIRO has discussed four stages within natural language
generation for the exhibit information descriptions: (i)
Content selection specifies the facts i.e., relations or
attributes that the exhibit information should describe;

(ii) Document planning which specifies the sequence of
facts and their rhetorical relations; (iii) Microplanning
specifies how facts expressed as a phrase in each
language; (iv) Surface realization produces the final
textual form of the descriptions.

The Personal Experience with Active Cultural Her-
itage (PEACH) [7] project has constructed the suite of
interactive and visitor-adaptive technologies for pro-
viding individual experience to the museum visitors.
For providing an adaptive, intelligent presentation of
exhibit information PEACH has implemented all fea-
tures similar to ILEX [28], and introduced video along
with the texts and images. Xscript language is used
to provide coherent presentations [29]. The presented


                                    Organization of Museum Exhibit Information 
for Ubiquitous Visitors


approach expands the range of choices to prepare coher-
ent presentations for the visitors according to their
history, interests, and previous knowledge.

PIL  (Personal  experience  with  active  cultural
heritage-IsraeL) is designed as an extension of the
PEACH project [30]. PIL project architecture consists
of a personal broker which present on visitor device to
deliver presentations and enables the visitor to control
the system; a spatial information broker observes
visitor position; a visitor modeler updates the model of
an individual visitor; a presentation composer suggests
presentation according to the preferences and locations
of the visitors; and a service manager provides context-
aware communication for visitors. In order to provide
personalized services in museum different aspects
are presented in [8], which includes preparation of
museum contents, ubiquitous visitor modeling, visitor
interface design, and system architectural aspects.

Oppermann et al. [21] has discussed the nomadic
information system for automatic selection and presen-
tation of exhibit information. A Web-based client-server
approach based on the visitor model provides adaptive
selection and presentation of exhibit information. The
visitors are allowed to control the adaptation by spec-
ifying their interests in a visitor model dialog. Visitor
interests are acquired by explicit visitor dialogs where
the visitors are allowed to set the languages, choose
automatic or manually controlled presentations, and
configure the interfaces, etc.

In [16, 31], macronode and cinematic techniques
[14, 32] are discussed to provide dynamic presentations
in museum. The rhetorical structure theory and the
repositories of material are used to provide specific
presentations based on the locations of the visitors and
the system observations about the visitor’s behavior to
obtain interests. In [33], SCALEX toolkit is designed
to prepare museum exhibitions with digital and
personalized content presentations according to the
individual interests of the visitors.

Despite of existing approaches available in the litera-
ture, the new approach of the organization of museum
exhibit information is still needed as providing exhibit
information is a compelling future to enhance ubiqui-
tous visitor’s experience. The proposed approach of the
organization of museum exhibit information improves
the relevance of exhibit information for the individual
requirements of the ubiquitous visitors.

infor-
mation is as shown in Figure 1. The proposed layout
consists of three levels of exhibit information at the
level of School Kids, College Students, and Professionals
ubiquitous visitors. The organization layout is needed

since depending on the education levels or levels of
understandings, etc., different segments of the exhibit
information are of different relevance for the museum
ubiquitous visitors [11, 21, 22, 34–39]. The segment
of the exhibit information which needs to be provided
depends on the understanding levels of the museum
ubiquitous visitors [13, 14, 40, 41]. Thus, we organize
the exhibit information at three levels, as essential infor-
mation and further as elaborated information according
to the understanding levels of the ubiquitous visitors.
The organized exhibit information is linked to the
specific URLs to provide relevant exhibit information
museum services to the ubiquitous visitors.

facts of the exhibits from multiple points of view
depending on the types of exhibits [26]. The exhibit
could be a historical statue, scientific exhibits, biolog-
ical exhibits, zoological exhibits, paintings, historical
locations, etc. We consider, the exhibit information
broadly characterizes the details about the Introductory
Attributes (IA) such as identity, type, size, shape, color,
texture, place, time, and origin of the exhibits; the Func-
tional/Behavioral Attributes (F/BA) such as functions,
working, properties, and role of the exhibits; and the
Descriptive Attributes (DA) such as additional evidence,
facts, features, specifications, life cycle, journey, and life
history of the exhibits.

The organization layouts are designed based upon
the predefined schematic representation of the exhibit
information. The layout provides a standard way
to describe the exhibit information with a pre-
defined structure of segments, and their orders. The
multiple levels of organized exhibit information are
obtained by combining the information segments
characterizing the attributes of the exhibits, where each
information segment adds more details to the preceding
information. The set of exhibit information attributes


Preeti            Khanwalkar,            Pallapa            Venkataram          
                         


are organized in advance and then dynamically
combined together according to the understanding
levels of the museum ubiquitous visitors. At each level,
along with the essential information, more detailed
information is added based on the understanding levels
of   the ubiquitous visitors as described below.

Essential Information: Essential Information provides
the key information of the exhibit to motivate
the visitors to explore the rest of the exhibit
information. Depending on the understanding levels
of   the ubiquitous visitors, the essential information
includes most common and comprehensive information
characterizing different attributes of exhibits such as
a    key or basic information about the place, origin or
formation of the exhibits; key or basic information
about functions, properties, working, roles of the
exhibits; key or basic information about features or
specifications of the exhibits as shown in Figure 2,
Figure 3, and Figure 4, respectively. During the visit,
whenever, ubiquitous visitors has no/less available
time, only the essential exhibit information is provided
to the visitors. Essential Information about exhibits Ei is
organized at respective URLs along with the elaborated
information at each level.

Information for the School Kids: School kids, along
with the Essential Information, need elementary and
distinguishing information which describes different
attributes of the exhibits such as the origin of exhibits,
the period of exhibits, size, the shape of the exhibits,
etc., with limited descriptions. Exhibit information of
each exhibit Ei for the school kids is organized at
Level l1 and linked to URL Ei-infol1.pet.iisc.in as shown
in Figure 2. The links indicate the relative order of
the association between different segments of exhibit
information attributes organized for the school kid
ubiquitous visitors.

Information for the College Students: College Stu-
dents, along with the Essential Information, need addi-
tional exhibit information, with the increasing details
of description including objects descriptions, features
descriptions, evidence about the origin, and so on.
Exhibit information of each exhibit Ei for the college
students is organized at Level l2 and linked to URL Ei-
infol2.pet.iisc.in as shown in Figure 3. The links indicate
the relative order of the association between different
segments of exhibit information attributes organized
for the college student ubiquitous visitors.

Information for the Professionals: Professionals,
along with the Essential Information, need detailed
exhibit information which is available for the exhibits.
For example, extended descriptions that describe
additional facts, evidence about the origin, comparative
facts, additional roles, detailed functionality, so on.
Exhibit information of each exhibit Ei for the
professionals is organized at Level l3 and linked to
URL Ei-infol3.pet.iisc.in as shown in Figure 4. The links

indicate the relative order of the association between
different segments of exhibit information attributes
organized for the professional ubiquitous visitors.

The fundamental need of the organization is
that the original museum exhibit information is
relevantly segmented according to the requirements
of the ubiquitous visitors. Indeed, the organization of
museum exhibit information is essential for both: (i)
To alleviate the information overloading problem for
the ubiquitous visitors by filtering and managing the
vast amount of information at different levels; (ii) To
provide the most significant information pertaining to
the individual requirements of the museum ubiquitous
visitors. The organized museum exhibit information
collates relevant segments of the exhibit information
based upon the significance and the meaningful
coherence [22, 40, 42]. The exhibit information is
organized in advance and used dynamically to cater to
the individual requirements of ubiquitous visitors.

ments of exhibit information are identified depending
on the available facts and attributes of the exhibits.
We organize three levels l={l₁, l₂, l₃} of the exhibit
information for the ubiquitous visitors such as School
Kids, college students, and professionals in the succeeding
order with each level contain the Essential Information.
The Essential Information covers the most salient infor-
mation, with each higher level l₁, l₂, and l₃ in succession
adds more detailed exhibit information for the ubiq-
uitous visitors. The segments of exhibit information
are collated in their temporal order of occurrence, the
order of events presented, the perspective with which
the exhibit information is narrated, and the amount
of information characterizes the exhibits to tailor to
the requirements of ubiquitous visitors. The organized
exhibit information in its multiple forms preserves the
required information for the individual requirements of
the ubiquitous visitors.

We consider an example of Swami Vivekananda
exhibit information as given in Figure 5. Suppose,
original exhibit information of Swami Vivekananda
as available from the server comprises of following
points. The exhibit information consists of different
segments which provide Swami Vivekananda birth
details, his relationship with Ramakrishna, lecture
tours in India, United Kingdom (UK), and United
States (US), Vivekananda philosophy, publications,
rock memorial, etc. The links indicate the relative
order of the association between different segments

present the organization of Swami Vivekananda exhibit
information at three levels of details along with the
essential information to cater to the individual needs of
ubiquitous visitors as below.

The organization of Swami Vivekananda exhibit
information for a school kid ubiquitous visitor at level l₁
is as shown in Figure 6. Initially, the information related
to identity, origin such as Swami Vivekananda birth
details, and basic functional and descriptive attributes
such as his relationship with Ramkrishna and as Hindu
monk are chosen to provide as essential information.
Further, for organizing the exhibit information at a
basic level l₁ other segments from the introductory,
functional/behavioral, and descriptive attributes such
as early childhood, his inclination towards Brahmo
followers, etc., are chosen based on their order of
occurrence for a school kid ubiquitous visitor.

Similarly, the organization of Swami Vivekananda
exhibit information for a college student ubiquitous
visitor at level l₂ is as shown in Figure 7. Initially, the
information related to identity, origin such as Swami
Vivekananda birth details, and basic functional and

descriptive attributes such as his relationship with
Ramkrishna and as Hindu monk are chosen to provide
as essential information. Further, for organizing the
exhibit information at the intermediate level l₂ other
segments describing additional information about
functional/behavioral, and descriptive attributes such
as his teachings and philosophy and lecture tours are
chosen based on their order of occurrence for a college
student ubiquitous visitor.

The organization of Swami Vivekananda exhibit
information for a professional ubiquitous visitor at level
l₃ is as shown in Figure 8. Initially, the information
related to identity, origin such as Swami Vivekananda
birth details, his relationship with Ramkrishna, and
functional and descriptive attributes such as his
inclination towards Brahmo followers are chosen
to provide as essential information. Further, for
organizing the exhibit information at advanced level l₃,
other segments describing detailed information about
introductory, functional/behavioral, and descriptive
attributes such as education details, his teachings,
and philosophy, his lecture tours, book publications

In this section, we present the simulation experiments
for the organization of museum exhibit information
for the ubiquitous visitors. We execute the simulation
using Python scripts and evaluate the museum exhibit
information organization time and the size of the
organized information for three different exhibits
information based on the understanding level of the
ubiquitous visitors. In the simulation, we consider
exhibit information of Swami Vivekananda, Moon, and
DNA exhibits are available at the museum server with
sizes 20 MB, 25 MB, and 30 MB, respectively. In
the simulation, we consider the varying size of the
exhibit information, with the variation in its essential
exhibit information and the available introductory,
functional/behavioral, and descriptive attributes. We
evaluate    the variation in the size of the organized
exhibit information with respect to the original
exhibit information at the understanding level of the
ubiquitous visitors.

As shown in Figure 9, the size of the organized
exhibit information of Swami Vivekananda decreases
with the decrease in details from professional to school
kid ubiquitous visitors, which avoids the overwhelming
of information. The difference in sizes indicates the
levels of details at which organized exhibit information
(around 16 MB, 10MB, and 5MB) is provided for
the professional, college student and the school kid

ubiquitous visitors in comparison to the size of the
original exhibit information (20 MB), which may
contain excessive and irrelevant for the ubiquitous
visitors.

Similarly, the size of the organized exhibit informa-
tion of Moon and DNA exhibits decreases according
to the understanding level of professionals, college
students, and school kids ubiquitous visitors as shown
in Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively. Further, we
evaluate the museum exhibit information organization
time corresponding to the size of the exhibit informa-
tion. The simulation is executed with varying essen-
tial exhibit information and the available introductory,
descriptive, and functional/behavioral attributes, and
accordingly exhibit information is organized for the
professionals, college students, and school kid ubiqui-
tous visitors. We found that with the increasing size of
the exhibit information, and with more availability of
essential exhibit information, the museum exhibit infor-
mation organization time increases with the increase in
the understanding levels of the ubiquitous visitors as
shown in Figure 12.

The organization of museum exhibit information is
presented to cater to the individual requirements of
the ubiquitous visitors. The Introductory Attributes (IA),
Functional/Behavioral Attributes (F/BA), and Descriptive
Attributes (DA) which broadly characterize the exhibit
information are identified and used to organize
the exhibit information. The exhibit information is

respective URLs and is used to cater to the individual
requirements of the museum ubiquitous visitors. The
simulation results show that the museum exhibit
information organization time and the size of the
organized information increase with the increase in
the understanding levels of the ubiquitous visitors.
In the future, we extend the proposed approach for
other application domains such as tourist-guides and
educational documentaries.
