Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine museum visitors’ experience. The objective of the
research is to explore preferences, behaviour, overall. This study experience and the determinants on
repeated visits to two heritage sites. In particular, a more comprehensive regression approach is
introduced and employed to compare results at two regional museums.
Design/methodology/approach – First, a factor analysis identifies a set of orthogonal factors
related to visitors’ perceptions on their positive and negative experiences at two different museums.
Second, a two-step cluster analysis is implemented to identify specific demand segments. Third,
a regression analysis reveals the key determinants that influence visitors’ perceptions on the quality of
services provided at the cultural sites. The empirical data were collected at two archaeological
museums located in Sardinia and Trentino Alto Adige (Italy).
Findings – On the whole, some homogeneous findings have been obtained for the two cultural sites,
regardless of the different levels of attractiveness exerted by these two museums. Moreover, the
outcomes highlight that the two museums need to be reinterpreted and reorganised with the provision
of supplementary services, able to satisfy a broader audience, and enriching their traditional mission
that is to collect, preserve and exhibit the archaeological heritage.
Practical implications – The methodological approach presented in this paper is for practitioners
and curators to deepen their understanding of their consumers and to improve the overall quantity and
quality of services offered.
Originality/value – This paper presents a novel and integrated approach to investigate customers’
experience and their needs with the aim of improving the overall quality of the services provided at the
museum. The proposed methodology is used to analyse multidimensional aspects of the visit to a
cultural site. Within the literature on museum marketing and management, this methodological
framework can be regarded as an alternative approach to analyse visitors’ experience, characteristics,
behaviour, preferences and to elicit specific characteristics of different segments of demand.

1. Introduction
An increasing number of studies highlight the contribution of cultural services and
involvement from a well-being perspective (Bandarin et al., 2011). Such a contribution is
justified by the convergence between culture and everyday life, driven by the on-going
process of culture democratisation, enhanced by a generalised higher level of education
(Silberberg, 1995; Lord, 1999; Mulcahy, 2006). This cultural upwards trend leads to an
increase in the number of people visiting cultural attractions such as museums,
galleries, festivals, heritage sites, artistic performances as well as attractions related to
food, fashion, language and religion. Understanding the role of positive externalities

exerted by the cultural activity has become the aim of the field of services research.
In this respect, scholars are devoting more attention to examine the determinants that
influence the participation in cultural goods and services.
However, managers and curators are questioning the role of museums in a digitally
and interconnected society and how they can engage with visitors drawing out
contemporary messages from their museum exhibitions. The mission of a museum is
not only the traditional role to collect, preserve, exhibit and encourage appreciation and
knowledge of the past. Nowadays, museums are becoming a place able to offer a wide
range of services that inspire visitors in a more friendly and welcoming environment.
Museum services consist of exhibitions as well as other tangible or intangible services
and experiences (Chan, 2009) that include organisation of courses and seminars,
bookshops, restaurants, brochures and other facilities that offer a better access and
interpretation of information, as well as the attitude and values transmitted to the
visitor (De Rojas and Camarero, 2008).
New generations of visitors require to interact with and be part of the exhibition.
The museum becomes an educational service centre that offers a wide range of
activities for both younger people and adults. However, museums are in competition
with many other types of leisure and entertainment activities, such as cinema, sporting
events, theatres and increasingly, visitors look for a global experience that includes
leisure, culture, education and social interaction ( Jansen-Verbeke and van Rekom, 1996;
Colbert, 2003; Aalst Van and Boogaarts, 2004; Geissler et al., 2006; Heidenreich and
Plaza, 2015). Thus, the role of policy makers is increasingly important, especially for
business-oriented museums and heritage organisations (Gilmore and Rentschler, 2002).
Visitors’ experience becomes an opportunity to further expand the visitors’ understanding
and learning (Colbert, 2003). In fact, as observed by Victorino et al. (2005), before
introducing a new service innovation, managers need to assess the value that it will bring
to their customers through empirical research methods, such as customer surveys. This
point is also valid for the supply of museum services. Considering the definitions of
service quality proposed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), museum service quality can be
disentangled into ten main dimensions: tangible items (e.g. adequate building, artefacts,
equipment, staff uniforms); reliability to deliver the expected service; responsiveness of
staff to help in an effective way; competence of staff in executing the service; courtesy
exhibited by staff; credibility on the overall museum service; security; access to the
museum (e.g. road information; transport facilities); communication of the services
provided (e.g. use of different languages; customers’ information centre); understanding
customers in the effort to know and understand their preferences, characteristics and
needs (see Agbor, 2011 for a detailed account on service quality and customer
satisfaction). As far as the last dimension is concerned, that is understanding the
customer, it is important to analyse visitors’ experience, behaviour and their commitment
to the cultural site also in the future, bearing in mind that each segment of demand carries
different expectations from the services offered at site (Chan, 2009; Youngs et al., 2014).
Focusing on museum visitors, part of the literature is devoted to investigate visitors’
willingness to pay, preferences, motivation, satisfaction and the probability to return
and to recommend the site to others (Hume et al., 2007). Contributing to the literature on
museum services, the present paper analyses visitors’ experience using an integrated
approach built on a stepwise analysis. This methodological approach integrates several
aspects related to the dimension on understanding museum visitors (Agbor, 2011).
To this aim, empirical data were collected through two identical questionnaires
administered during the period June-December 2011 at the Archaeological Museum in

Bolzano (known as the Ötzi Museum), located in the homonymous Autonomous
Province (Northeast of Italy) and at the National Museum “Giovanni Antonio Sanna”
(from now on the Sanna Museum) in Sassari (Sardinia, Italy). The former hosts a
well-preserved ice mummy, so-called Ötzi, and all his artefacts from over 5,000 years ago;
this is a unique discovery that continues to attract not only visitors but also academics
from all over the world. The Sanna Museum hosts findings from the lower Palaeolithic
to late Neolithic produced by the ancient Nuragic civilisation, one of the most advanced
in the Mediterranean area in prehistoric times. These museums hold their interest
as they are located in regions that are highly specialized in tourism.
The Bolzano Province is a mountain destination, with a bimodal seasonality, while
Sardinia is a typical sea and sun destination with uni-modal seasonality.
These two museums have a common mission and are both non-profit institutions.
The present study explores possible common regularities by running the same
questionnaire to visitors at the sites. The baseline framework consists of three main
research steps: first, a factor analysis defines a set of orthogonal factors, related to
visitors’ positive and negative experiences perceived during their visit. Second,
a two-step cluster (TSC) analysis is employed to identify specific segments of demand.
Third, a regression specification includes a set of socio-demographic and economic
determinants as well as the uncorrelated variables as identified in the previous steps.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the basic background and
introduces the conceptual framework. Section 3 describes the baseline of the
methodological approach employed in each of the three steps. Section 4 introduces
the data and reports the main descriptive statistics. In Section 5 the empirical results
are discussed. Concluding remarks are included in the last section.
2. Background and conceptual framework
2.1 Literature review
To maintain museums long-term growth, it is important to provide quality experience
and ensure high levels of customer satisfaction. The provision of high-quality services
to consumers also promotes customers’ loyalty, which, in turn, enhances the
profitability of service providers (Laroche et al., 2004; Dagger and Sweeney, 2007).
As argued by Villeneuve (2012), the improvement of a visitors’ centric perspective
supports a sustainable managerial approach of museums. Goulding (2000) examines
the behaviour of museum visitors in order to evaluate the impact of exhibitions and
experience on their satisfaction. As Chan (2009) remarks, museums can be perceived as
experience goods and hence visitors’ perception is needed in order to accomplish
mutual benefits. In order to reach the museum managements aim of aligning their offer
with the visitors’ perspective a management and marketing strategy that incorporates
a customer feedback systems is required that collects information about visitors’
attitudes, behaviour and satisfaction.
The determinants of cultural goods and services participation is well documented in
the literature (Provins et al., 2008; Jaffry and Apostolakis, 2011; Ateca-Amestoy and
Prieto-Rodríguez, 2013; Palma et al., 2013). As far as museums are concerned, the literature
investigates visitors’ preferences, motivation, satisfaction, and their probability to return
and to recommend the site, as well as the overall degree of competiveness with respect to
other similar cultural sites. A museum is a combination of tangible and intangible
experiences that are related to exogenous factors (e.g. quantity and quality of services
provided) as well as endogenous factors (e.g. visitors’ motivations, feelings). The overall
experience is considered as the final “outcome” or the “product” of museums (Chan, 2009).

In order to evaluate the museum experience, respondents commonly provide
answers to a set of statements ranked with a standard five-point Likert scale.
To analyse this kind of data, structural equation models (SEM), factor and path
analysis are frequently applied (e.g. Harrison and Shaw, 2004; Jeong and Lee, 2006;
Gil and Ritchie, 2009). For example, Harrison and Shaw (2004) run a SEM to study
satisfaction about the visit and attitudes towards the exhibition and the experience at a
small metropolitan museum in Australia. By using data on 184 face-to-face interviews,
the authors find an inverse relationship between satisfaction and intention to return.
Jeong and Lee (2006) and Gil and Ritchie (2009) employ a factor and path analysis,
respectively, to study if the museum environment and building affect visitors’
satisfaction and to test, amongst other hypotheses, if perceptions of the museum are
affected by previous visits. While Jeong and Lee (2006) find that curiosity has a positive
effect on visitors’ satisfaction, Gil and Ritchie (2009) find that museum perception is not
affected by the number of previous visits. From a methodological point of view, visitors’
experience can be analysed more in depth by employing further quantitative approaches
such as count models (Brida et al., 2012a, b, 2013c, 2014).
2.2 The conceptual framework
A better managerial and marketing strategy can be achieved by exploring the
characteristics of different segments of demand as well as visitors’ needs and wants
(Villeneuve, 2012). This objective is not so straightforward. On the one hand, a set of
latent factors can be obtained through a factor analysis. On the other hand, a cluster
analysis allows one to group visitors with common characteristics.
Within a behavioural and experiential approach, in the present study, data are
collected at two museums, by using identical questionnaires. Specifically, the integrated
approach includes three main steps as presented in Figure 1.
First, the categorical variables, expressed as positive and negative items as
perceived by the respondents during their visit at the museum, are analysed through a
factor analysis, that is a principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis is carried
out to investigate the correlation patterns among the set of items and create principal
components characterised by the orthogonality assumption (e.g. Akar, 2013).

As a second step of the investigation, a cluster analysis is carried out to aggregate
respondents into distinct groups, each of them characterised by the most similar units
and dissimilar from the reminder groups (Brida et al., 2013a). For example, in
D’Urso et al. (2013), the clusters are employed as dependent variables within a
multinomial framework to understand the factors that influence each market segment.
In Brida et al. (2012d, 2013b), the clusters are employed as regressors in the Tobit
regression to investigate the factors that influence cruisers’ expenditure. Likewise,
in the present paper, the demand segments obtained via a TSC analysis are included as
regressors into the parametric specification.
As a final step of the investigation, the regression is run integrating the set of
socio-demographic and economic determinants, as well as the PCA factors and clusters.
As observed by Ateca-Amestoy and Prieto-Rodríguez (2013), when estimating the
demand for cultural activities, the economic variables, such as own price, cross-prices and
income are not the only determinants to affect consumer demand, unlike in the standard
demand for goods and services. Indeed, categorical variables that express motivations
and the overall experience are likely to play a relevant role in explaining individual
choice. In this paper, the number of times a respondent reported to have visited the
museum in the past is employed as the dependent variable to elicit visitors’ attendance,
and hence, estimate visitors’ likelihood to repeat the visit. This variable is a count by
nature and, since the interviews were run at the end of the visit, cannot take the value of
zero. Therefore, as a basic model, a zero-truncated Poisson needs to be estimated
assuming the equi-dispersion hypothesis (i.e. mean statistically equal to variance) that
implies that only one parameter, for each coefficient, describes the mean and the variance
of the distribution. This approach has the advantage that it can be applied without any a
priori theoretical structure as required in SEM (Kline, 1998). Moreover, the precision of
the estimates is less affected by sample size while SEM requires a large sample size –
generally several hundred observations – and a trade-off exists between the complexity
of the model and the goodness-of-fit (Schumacker and Lomax, 1996).
3. Methodology
The methodological strategy consists of three main steps: a factor analysis is used to define
a set of orthogonal factors; a cluster analysis is employed to identify specific segments of
demand, and a regression specification is run by using a set of socio-demographic and
economic determinants variables, together with the factors and the clusters obtained in the
previous steps. The proposed methodology is used as a tool to analyse multidimensional
aspects of the visit to the cultural site. Within the literature on museum’s marketing and
management, this methodological framework can be regarded as an alternative approach
to analyse visitors’ experience, characteristics, behaviour and preferences and able to elicit
specific characteristics of different segments of demand. This type of methodological
approach has been recently adopted in the museum sector by various studies, including
Robb et al. (2014), Dillon et al. (2014) and Brida et al. (2012a, b, c, 2013a, 2014).
3.1 First step: factor analysis
Through a factor analysis run with categorical variables, an initial set of items is
reduced to a more manageable group. A set of categorical variables, expressing
respondents’ opposite negative and positive experiences about their visit at the
museum, are defined by a five-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much),
according to their level of agreement on each item. The objective is to run a PCA that,
without a priori specific hypotheses on the conceptual domain of the items, allows one

experience

52

to eliminate the redundancy in the original data and reduce the items to a set of factors,
as a combination of the original items. An orthogonal Equamax rotation is employed
which parsimoniously simplifies the number of items and factors. The Anderson-Rubin
method is used to estimate factor score coefficients. The resulting scores are
uncorrelated, have a mean equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to one. As the
Kaiser criterion suggests, only factors with eigenvalues greater than one are retained.
Following Hatcher (1994), the items with a loading score (i.e. variable contribution) less
than a critical value (in this case 0.40) are excluded from the analysis. Cronbach’s α is
also applied as a commonly used measure to test the reliability of the extracted factors.
Values higher than 0.7 suggests for the reliability of the factors. The relative weight of
each factor in the total variance is calculated, that takes into account how much each
factor explains of the total variance. Cumulative inertia shows the amount of variance
explained by n+(n+1) factors (Escofier and Pages, 1988).
To establish the adequacy of the factor analysis, two tests are conducted: the
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy test that with a value
between 0.50 and 1.00 implies that the analysis is satisfactory (Kaiser, 1974) and the
Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity where the null hypothesis is that the correlation matrix is an
identity matrix.
3.2 Second step: cluster analysis
As a further step of the statistical investigation, a TSC analysis, that allows one to include
both continuous and categorical variables, is run to find homogeneous groups. A TSC
analysis consists of grouping similar individuals according to their degree of similarity.
Individuals within each cluster are more closely related to one another than individuals
assigned to different clusters and each cluster can be distinguished from the others.
In this specific case, the log-likelihood is used as a distance measure where continuous
variables are assumed to be characterised by a normal distribution, while categorical
variables are assumed to be characterised by a multinomial distribution and the variables
are independent of each other. Furthermore, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is
employed to determine the best number of clusters (Fraley and Raftery, 1998).
3.3 Third-integrated step: regression model
The behavioural and experiential model is estimated using a count data regression
technique. This specification allows one to account for the non-negative, integer nature
of data on the number of times respondents visited the museums and is suitable when
the counts are small (Englin et al., 2003). In the literature, there are several examples of
empirical applications that analyse recreational demand behaviour applying Poisson
type models. Grogger and Carson (1991) employ standard truncated Poisson and
negative binomial models to estimate fishing demand in Alaska. Likewise, Bhat uses a
combined model of travel cost and contingent behaviour to estimate the recreational
value of reef quality improvements in the Florida Keys marine reserve. MartínezEspiñeira and Amoako-Tuffour (2008) estimate and compare several truncated count
data models of recreation demand employing on-site survey data from Gros Morne
National Park in Newfoundland. Chae et al. employ Poisson models to estimate a travel
cost model in order to obtain the non-market recreational benefits arising from the
Lundy Island Marine Nature Reserve. This class of models presents several advantages
with respect to other approaches such as PLS and SEM that are commonly used in the
managing and marketing literature. Specifically, the SEM is based on a hypothetical
construct rather than on actual data, and therefore, the cause-effect relationships

suggested by the model may not represent the true causal nature of the relations
among the constructs. While, amongst others, count models help establishing the
interrelationship among the variables under investigation based on the empirical data.
Differently from the PLS specifications, count models have the advantage to easily
interpret the independent “latent” variables that can be constructed a priori through
PCA and cluster analysis, as in the framework proposed in the present study. Also,
count models, and in general probabilistic modelling, provides test statistics and the
distributional properties of estimates that in PLS are unknown (Fornell and Bookstein,
1982; Pirouz, 2006).
On this basis, the standard procedure for count data are followed. A standard Poisson
model is constructed, where the distribution is given by the following expression:
ProbðY i ¼ yi jwi Þ ¼

el lyi
yi !

0

yi ¼ 0; 1; 2; ::: E ð yi jxi Þ ¼ Varð yi jxi Þ ¼ l ¼ exi b

(1)

The parameter λ represents the average and the variance, as assumed by the Poisson
distribution, and is greater than zero. The Poisson model is non-linear, however, it can
be easily estimated by the maximum likelihood technique. In the literature, there
are many extensions of the Poisson model according to the characteristics of the
empirical data as well as the dispersion feature, that is the inequality of the mean and
the variance.
In the present study, as the survey is run at the site, the count data are truncated,
as the data are observed only over part of the range of the response variable. Examples
of truncated count applications include the number of bus trips made per week in
surveys taken on buses, the number of shopping trips made by individuals sampled
at a national park. As zero counts are not observed, the data are zero truncated,
or more generally left truncated. A zero-truncated Poisson model is specified by the
following equation:
ProbðY i ¼ yi jwi 4 0Þ ¼

el lyi
1
U
yi ! ð1el Þ

yi ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . .

(2)

where wi denotes the other controls as socio-economic characteristics of individual i (ki),
perception on the bundle of characteristics of the destination and the heritage site (zi) and
costs (xi). As stated, the dependent variable assumes values that range from 1 (i.e. first
time visit to the museum) to n. Thus visit is zero truncated, and a zero-truncated Poisson
(or negative binomial) regression allows one to model visits with this specific restriction.
In line with previous studies (Brida et al., 2012a, b, 2014), the demand for museum
can be expressed as follows:
Y i ¼ f ðTC i ; X i ; F i ; Cl i ; aÞþ ei

(3)

where Yi is the entry required by the ith individual to visit the museums. TCi is the
travel cost associated with visiting the jth recreation site, Xi is the vector of explanatory
variables. As stated in the methodological framework, based on the first and
second step of the analysis (Figure 1), Fi are the latent factors associated with the
experience at the site, as obtained via the factor analysis, Cli is a vector representing
the clusters, as obtained by the TSC analysis, αi is a vector of unknown parameter and
εi the error term.

4. Sample and measure
4.1 The demand at the Sanna Museum and the Ötzi Museum: seasonal distribution
and trend
Empirical data are collected at two cultural sites: the Ötzi Museum in Bolzano and the
Sanna Museum in Sassari (Italy). These cultural sites, given their scientific importance,
constitute key tourism attractions, for both serious and casual tourists (Stebbins, 1996;
Brida et al., 2012c) in geographical areas out of the typical cultural Italian tourism
itineraries (e.g. Florence, Rome and Venice).
As depicted in Figure 2, these two museums are also characterised by a different
distribution in the number of visitors. On average, considering the time span between
January 2007 and December 2010, the demand for the Sanna Museum is characterised by
a binomial distribution with a peak in May and a smaller peak in September. These
months in Sardinia have to be regarded as the shoulder tourism season. Hence, there
appears a mismatch between cultural visitors and standard sea and sun tourists who
prefer spending their vacation in July and August. Notably, visitors at the Ötzi Museum
are characterised by a uni-modal distribution with the peak occurring in the summer
months of July and August, rather than in the ski season (between December and April).
A further analysis, obtained by employing the Hodrick-Prescott filter, relates to the
trend in the number of visitors (Figure 3). Although, a relatively short time span is
considered, it is clear that the Sanna Museum is characterised by a downwards trend,
while the Ötzi Museum presents an upwards trend.
4.2 The survey
In order to run a comparative analysis on the determinants that influence the demand
at the museums, an identical survey was administered at the sites, from June to
December 2011, via face-to-face interviews on weekdays (except for the closing day on
Mondays) and on Saturdays and Sundays, at different opening hours (between 10.00 a.m.
to 6 p.m.). Running the survey within such a wider span of time provides a better
insight on the heterogeneous characteristics of visitors in the typical tourism season as
well as in the low tourism season.

A questionnaire was structured on previous literature. Specifically, a set of positive
and negative statements about visitors’ experience at a museum were identified
through an in-depth literature review (Burton et al., 2009; Brida et al., 2012a, b, c;
D’Urso et al., 2013). On the whole, the questionnaire contained a total of 37 questions
organised in three blocks: the first section asked information on the visit to the
museum; the second section asked information about the visitors’ trip to the city
(Sassari or Bolzano) if they were not resident; the third section contained a set of
questions on the socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the visitor.
A standard five-point Likert scale was used to establish visitors’ degree of agreement
about their motivation and experience at the museum. In addition, the questionnaire
contained a set of questions that help to identify targeted and structured priority
areas for improvement.
To overcome the potential bias derived from a random sample procedure, the
respondents were selected with a quota random sampling procedure based on age and
gender trying to capture heterogeneous demographics features. Based on the visitors
data of the previous year, provided by the administrative office of the museums, the
sample size was determined according to a 95 per cent confidence level with a 5 per cent
error. Overall, 434 complete interviews were obtained at the Sanna museum and 1,052
complete interviews were obtained at the Ötzi Museum.

4.3 Descriptive statistics
Most of the respondents (65 per cent) visiting the Sanna Museum are from Italy.
They are mostly female (53 per cent) and married/de facto (52 per cent). Visitors
between 28 and 57 years old tend to visit the museum more than either young people
(14.7 per cent) or older than 72 years old (3.5 per cent). Respondents aged between
58 and 72 are also well represented (22.9 per cent). Overall, respondents hold a high
school level of education and 41.8 per cent of the sample has an annual net income that
ranges between 26,000 and 50,000 euros, while 29.6 per cent has an annual income of
25,000 euros or less. As far as the employment status is concerned, the majority is
occupied either as an autonomous worker or as a full-time/part-time worker (overall,
these categories represent 55.3 per cent).
As far as the Ötzi Museum is concerned, the percentage of the visitors who are from
European countries (48 per cent) and Italy (47 per cent) are approximately the same.
Females account for 51 per cent and the majority are married/de facto (72 per cent).
A large proportion of the sample (44 per cent) is between 41 and 55 years old. Regarding
the education level, 56 per cent hold a college degree or a higher degree. Moreover,
57 per cent of the respondents declared to have a middle-high income, while 10 per cent
an annual income less than 25,000 euros. Full results can be provided upon request.
5. Empirical evidence
5.1 First step: factor analysis
In the case of the Sanna Museum, the PCA leads to the identification of three factors
that explain 50 per cent of the total data variance (Table II). These factors are further
reduced to two factors, given the poor level of reliability and meaning of the last factor
as suggested by the Cronbach’s α (equals to 0.32). The KMO equals 0.75, indicating that
the analysis is satisfactory. Also, the Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity test ( ¼ 873.06;
significance ¼ 0.000) indicates that the null hypothesis of an identity matrix is rejected.
Factor 1 (positive experience) includes items related to a positive perception of the
experience at the museum (i.e. feeling of happiness, feeling having fun, felt guided,
felt astonished, feeling having learnt something new and feeling safe). The total
variance explained by this factor (20.1 per cent) indicates that this is the most
important; the Cronbach’s α equals to 0.68, and although its reliability is questionable,
it can be still regarded as congruent. Factor 2 (negative experience) relates to a negative
perception of the experience at the museum (i.e. feeling tense, feeling wasting time,
feeling bored and feeling tired). In this case, it explains 18 per cent of the total variance
and presents a Cronbach’s α equals to 0.68. Although the reliability of these two factors
is questionable yet are retained since they are meaningful (see also Kibicho, 2008). It is
worthwhile noting, that further experiments have been run by excluding certain items
that presented a relatively low loading factor. Yet, these specifications were less robust
in terms of the overall relevant statistics.
As far as the Ötzi Museum is concerned, the factor analysis also leads to the
identification of three factors that explain almost 50 per cent of the total data variance
(Table I). These factors were further reduced to two factors, given the poor level of
reliability and meaning of the last factor (Cronbach’s α equals to 0.28). In this case,
the KMO equals 0.71, indicating that the analysis is satisfactory. Also, the Bartlett’s
Test of Sphericity test ( ¼ 1,916.43; significance ¼ 0.000) indicates that the null
hypothesis of an identity matrix is rejected. Factor 1 (positive experience) includes
items related to a positive perception of the experience at the museum (i.e. feeling
having fun, feeling astonished, feeling having learnt something and feeling happiness).

The total data variance explained by this factor (18.4 per cent) indicates that this is the
predominant one; the Cronbach’s α equals to 0.66, and although its reliability is
questionable, it can be regarded as congruent. Factor 2 (negative experience) relates to
a negative perception of the experience at the museum (i.e. feeling tired, feeling lost,
feeling wasting time and feeling bored). In this case, it explains 17.1 per cent of the total
variance and presents a Cronbach’s α equals to 0.63.
5.2 Second step: cluster analysis
The cluster analysis and specifically the TSC, run in IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 19),
identifies three main clusters based on 434 respondents, reflecting their length of stay
at the Sanna Museum.
Full statistics on the results obtained for this museum are reported in Figure 4.
Cluster 2 (short staying) comprises 41.2 per cent (174) of the total respondents
and is characterised by relatively short staying and middle-aged visitors. Cluster 1
(middle staying) includes 144 respondents (34.2 per cent of the sample) and is
characterised by middle staying and relatively young visitors. Finally, Cluster 3
(long staying) comprises 24.6 per cent of the sample (for a total of 104 respondents)
characterised by relatively long staying and older visitors.
The silhouette measure of cohesion and separation is rather fair. The ratio of cluster
sizes presents a value under two (1.67) that implies that no cluster is more than two times
larger than any other clusters. Respondents within Cluster 2 are on average middle aged
(44 years old against a global median of 45), tend to spend a relatively short time visiting
the museum with an average of 54 minutes (against a global median of 90 minutes), paid
an entrance ticket and visited six other museums in the last year (against a global median
equal to four). The second cluster (Cluster 1) comprises respondents who are fairly young
(36 years old) and on average spend 106 minutes during their visit at the museum, paid an
entrance ticket and visited five other museums in the last 12 months. Finally, the third
cluster (Cluster 3) includes the relatively oldest respondents (average age 63 years old),
who tend to spend 114 minutes visiting the museum, did not pay an entrance ticket and
visited six other museums in the last year. Hence, this latter cluster is characterised by
individuals who are serious cultural tourists and have more time to spend on leisure.
The same analysis is performed for the Ötzi Museum. Three clusters are also
identified as follows (Figure 4): Cluster 1 (short staying) comprises 45.1 per cent of the
total respondents and is characterised by relatively short staying and young visitors.
Cluster 2 (long staying) includes 31.0 per cent of the sample (for a total of 316
respondents) and is characterised by relatively long staying and middle-aged visitors.
Finally, Cluster 3 (middle staying) comprises 23.8 per cent of the sample (for a total of 243
respondents) characterised by relatively middle staying and older visitors.
The silhouette measure of cohesion and separation is sufficient. The ratio of cluster
sizes presents a value under two (1.69) that implies that no cluster is more than two times
larger than any other cluster. Respondents within Cluster 1 are fairly young with an
average age of 36 (against a global median of 44), tend to spend a relatively short time
visiting the museum with an average of 76 minutes (against a global median of
91 minutes), on average spend 19.34 euro that is higher the global median (that equals
17.98 euro) and visited four other museums in the last year (against a global median
equal to 3). The second cluster comprises respondents who on average are aged 44, hence
cutting almost perfectly the global distribution, on average they spend a relatively long
time visiting the museum (136 minutes), their average expenditure at the museum is
24.25 euro and visited four other museums in the last 12 months. Finally, the third cluster

includes the relatively oldest respondents (average age 59 years old), who tend to spend
85 minutes visiting the museum, on average tend to spend 21.17 euro and visited five
other museums in the last year. Hence, this latter cluster is characterised by individuals
who are serious cultural tourists, have more time for leisure and are also likely to spend a
fair amount of money in the museum.
5.3 Third-integrated step: regression model
The final step of the analysis incorporates the results obtained from the factor analysis
and the cluster analysis into the regression analysis (the STATA 13 package is employed).
This integrated approach is feasible since the orthogonality of the estimated factors is
ensured, as explained in the methodological section. Hence, the factors can be used as
regressors in the relevant specification (e.g. Huang and Lee, 2011). Besides, the clusters
previously obtained, defined as dummy variables, are included as further regressors in
order to assess in what measure certain market segments can influence attendance.
Accordingly, the first model estimates visitors’ behaviour at the Sanna Museum, while the
second model investigates visitors’ behaviour at the Ötzi Museum. Results are reported on
coefficients, that is the incidence rate ratios (IRR) (Tables II and III). The Poisson

regression coefficient ( β) is the difference between the logs of expected counts:


b ¼ log mx þ 1 log mx
where μ is the expected count evaluated at x+1 and x. This expression can be also written
in the following manner:
b ¼ log mx þ 1 =mx



that is the log of the ratio of expected counts. In addition, the incidence rate is the number
of events per time.
A zero-truncated Poisson is empirically the best specification since the dependent
variable, number of visits at the museum allows for the specific restriction, ranging
from 1 to n (i.e. the count variable cannot be zero). Moreover, in the both cases the null
hypothesis cannot be rejected, that is the empirical model fits the data implying the
goodness-of-fit; for the Ötzi Museum: deviance goodness-of-fit ¼ 114.8755,
Prob W χ2(381) ¼ 1.0000; Pearson goodness-of-fit ¼ 172.3535, Prob W χ2(381) ¼ 1.0000.
For the Sanna Museum: deviance goodness-of-fit ¼ 47.06849, Prob W χ2(151) ¼ 1.0000;
Pearson goodness-of-fit ¼ 60.53659, Prob W χ2(151) ¼ 1.0000. Furthermore, the Akaike
Information Criterion and the BIC are employed to empirically assess the standard
Poisson models in comparison with the zero-truncated Poisson specifications. In both
the cases, the two criteria are minimised when the truncated specification is applied.
Besides, the Wald test indicates that the overall models are well specified at the
statistical level of 1 per cent. As a result, there is statistical ground to retain the
zero-truncated Poisson as a better empirical specifications. The models have been also
estimated correcting for robust standard errors to account for the relatively low
number of observations that may lead to heteroskedasticity problems in the residuals,
a rather common diagnostic problem when using survey data.
5.3.1 The Sanna Museum. By taking into account only statistically significant
variables, it emerges that, amongst the economic variables, ceteris paribus, income
under the lower bound of the reference category (€40,000-€70,000) is expected to have a
rate 2.77 times greater for museum attendance. While, on the upper bound of the
reference category, the rate ratio for the dependent variable is expected to decrease by a
rather marginal factor. In terms of the set of control variables, being a widower
decreases the rate ratio of attendance by a very marginal factor. However, being Italian
positively influences the dependent variable and is expected to have a rate of 2.54 times
greater than for the reference group.
A significant expectation to repeat the visit is found for respondents who are
visiting the museum with their children, if compared to those who are not; as the IRR
indicates 9.00 times more. On the opposite extreme, those who visited the museum
within an organised group are less likely to be repeaters, although the IRR is marginal
(IRR ¼ 0.00). Interestingly, the probability to learn something (plearn) appears to
negatively influence attendance at this cultural site (IRR ¼ 0.28).
Considering the cluster dummies, and keeping the short staying visitors as the
reference category, it emerges that long staying visitors have an expected repetition of
the visit 3.68 times higher than the short staying visitors. Likewise, middle staying
visitors reveal an expected repetition of the experience 3.88 times higher than the
reference category.

5.3.2 The Ötzi Museum. In this section, the experience and behaviour of visitors at the
Ötzi Museum is investigated by employing the same construct used for the Sanna
Museum. Apart from the income controls, that are not statistically significant in the Ötzi
model, the statistically significant coefficients reveal that widows are less likely to revisit
the museum when compared to married people treated as the reference category
(IRR ¼ 0.00). The probability to revisit is also lower for organised group visitors
(IRR ¼ 0.00). As for the Sanna Museum, the probability to learn something (plearn) during
the visit reduces the likelihood to revisit Ötzi (IRR ¼ 0.48). Turning to the coefficients of
the cluster variables, long staying visitors denote a rate ratio approximately twice higher
than the middle staying group (IRR ¼ 1.99). Also, the belief that the museum is a tourism
attraction positively influences the likelihood to revisit the museum by 1.71 times.
The total expenditure (i.e. Texpenditure as the sum of travel costs, accommodation
costs, food and beverage expense and spending in shopping in Bolzano) has a
significant effect on the dependent variable (IRR ¼ 1.00). As a further investigation,
costs are also disaggregated in order to assess the influence of the single components of
expenditure on the dependent variable. Notably, accommodation costs, that only
present a statistically significant coefficient, are possibly driving the significance of the
coefficient of the aggregated expenditure variable (IRR ¼ 1.00).
6. Discussion on the empirical findings
Results have suggested that some determinants, which influence museum visitors’
behaviour expressed in terms of a revisit to the cultural site, have led to homogenous
findings, regardless the different attractive power exerted by these two museums.
In particular, being Italian positively influences a revisit both at the Sanna and the
Ötzi Museum. This outcome may provide useful directions to museum marketers
and managers.
On the one hand, the Sanna Museum is located on an island and is most likely to be
visited by Italians and especially people from Sardinia, as shown by the descriptive
statistics that indicate 65 per cent of the total interviewed sample is from Italy and
41 per cent of the total sample is from Sardinia. As reported by Iorio (2004), and confirmed
by Meleddu and Pulina (2012), in Sardinian there is still a low level of connectivity
between museums. Therefore, an adequate network amongst Sardinian museums, as well
as with the public and private operators in tourist destinations on the island, may activate
a greater flow of visitors to the museum throughout the year. From the present
investigation, in fact it appears that the Sanna Museum would significantly benefit of such
a network that will lead to an increase in attendance, especially, of Italians. On the other
hand, the Ötzi Museum is located at the boundary with Austria, and from the descriptive
statistics, it emerges that foreigners are the majority (56 per cent of the sample), in addition
34 per cent of the total interviewed visitors are German. A wider interconnection amongst
Bolzano – as a bilingual Province of Italy with strong German roots – and AustrianGerman museums would also encourage attendance and revisit. These arguments are also
in line with the well-established relationship between culture and tourism as assessed by
Jansen-Verbeke and Van Rekom (1996) and Stebbins (1996) (see also, OECD, 2009). Several
empirical investigations show the relevant economic impact in terms of revenues and
employment ( Jolliffe and Smith, 2001; Plaza, 2000; Aalst Van and Boogaarts, 2004; Plaza
et al., 2011). Carey et al. (2013), for example, provide evidence that the Te Papa Museum in
Wellington (New Zealand) has a positive impact on tourism flows, giving further evidence
of the important role exerted by cultural sites in attracting tourists in urban areas.

From the present regression analysis, it emerges that determinants such as a visit
with an organised group exerts a negative impact on revisit. Furthermore, although
visiting the museum with children does not influence attendance at Ötzi Museum, it has
a relevant and highly statistically significant effect on the Sanna Museum. On this
basis, the Sanna Museum needs to implement a wider range of services, especially,
directed to families with children. At this point, Meleddu and Pulina (2012), via a
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats analysis, highlighted the lack of
attraction and multimedia activities for children and teenagers at the site. This
circumstance is regarded as a weakness as well as a potential threat for preventing
young people from a higher level of education, that is one of the main missions of a
cultural institution. Hence, the empirical outcome, here presented, has suggested that
higher level of investment directed especially to young people is likely to drive higher
flows of visitors, that also implies a higher return for the museum as a business. In this
respect, museums face a high level of competition and in times of public expenditure
cost cutting, a museum’s management should take into account visitor numbers as an
important source of funds by adapting over time to attract new segments of demand.
A thread of research provides further evidence that families are likely to learn from
exhibits and that the level of learning is related to specific observed behaviours (Borun
et al., 1996; for a detailed literature review see Ellenbogen et al., 2005). Also, economic
theory suggests that past consumption of cultural goods tends to increase visitors’
consumption in the future. This special pattern of demand relates to the so-called
learning-by-consuming approach. Accordingly, the consumption experience leads one
to attribute a higher value to additional units of cultural goods (Brito and Barros, 2005).
As Ateca-Amestoy (2007) assesses, those who consume more cultural goods in childhood
tend to consume more in their adulthood.
An interesting homogeneous outcome emerges when considering the different
clusters of visitors expressed in terms of length of stay at the museums. Interestingly,
being a “long staying” visitor positively influences attendance both at the Sanna and the
Ötzi Museum. This finding may be thought of as counter intuitive as the time spent
visiting the museum may be regarded as a proxy for the opportunity cost of leisure time
and one would expect that those who spent longer visiting the museum are less likely to
repeat the visit (Brida et al., 2012c). Yet, at this point, Youngs et al. (2014) find that three
types of visitors can be distinguished: those who appear to cherry pick from a range of
material offered at the museum, especially young people who stay for the shortest time
span; those who visit the whole exhibition in depth; and those who concentrate only on
very specific material on offer. It is likely that the last two types of visitors who appear to
be very interested in the exposition, or specific rooms, may revisit in the future because
they can be defined as serious cultural visitors (Stebbins, 1996; Brida et al., 2012c). Given
that a longer length of stay significantly encourages repeat visitation, especially for the
Sanna case, it would be worthwhile investing in a more relaxing environment with
additional services that, at the moment, are still lacking.
Trip costs have no impact on visits to the Sanna Museum, while Ötzi visitors are
especially affected by accommodation costs in South Tyrol. This outcome, may be
attributed to the distinctive features of the cities hosting the two museums and their
different living costs. Results are also in line with other empirical studies concerning
probability to revisit cultural attractions (Brida et al., 2012b) and other tourism
attractions (Scarpa et al., 2007). The belief that the Ötzi Museum is a tourism attraction
strongly and positively influences attendance at the museum. This is also in line with
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (1998), who points out that “tourism needs destinations, and

museums are premier attractions […] and museums need visitors, and the tourism
industry, more than the other sectors of economy, can deliver the hordes to museum
doors” (p. 36).
From a practitioner perspective, this paper has highlighted in what manner museum
managers and marketers need to activate more proactive campaigns and networking to
encourage attendance and loyalty for different market segments. The empirical
findings have highlighted that the two museums analysed, and especially the Sanna
Museum, have the potential to become a reference point for different segments of
demand and especially for young people, based on the implementation of a wide range
of services. Given that, in a digital era, media panels and touch screen interactive
projections are already rather diffuse in museums, the next challenge is to set spaces
that can host classes, reading rooms, interactive spaces, online activities that can also
involve audience outside. In times of digital change, young generations expect to
interact with the museum: before the visit, to gather information on why they may visit it.
During the visit, when they actively participate in the exhibition, through a wide range
of activities, also capturing their involvement with photos and tweets. After their visit,
not only sharing their experience via social networks, but also leading to new ways of
participation by the implementation of ideas that can enhance over time the identity of
the visited site, as a cultural asset that enriches the wider digital community (Anderson,
2004; Falk and Dierking, 2012; Rozan, 2014; Works, 2014).
7. Conclusions
Nowadays, museums have to compete with other forms of leisure and entertainment
activities, and to understand the visitors’ experience at a site becomes an opportunity
for managers and curators to develop new services that cover all the spheres of custom
satisfaction (Colbert, 2003; Zeithaml et al., 2006). This is strategic to help museums
which have to innovate and adopt new marketing methods to improve their appeal
(Geissler et al., 2006).
The present paper has investigated a particular aspect of service quality related to
understanding customers’ experience in order to provide quality services according to
their needs and wants (Parasuraman et al., 1988). An integrated approach has been
employed as a tool to analyse multidimensional aspects of the visit to a cultural site.
Within the literature on service marketing and management, this methodological
framework can be regarded as an alternative approach to analyse visitors’ experience,
characteristics, behaviour and preferences and able to elicit specific characteristics of
different segments of demand.
The integrated approach has consisted of three main research steps: first, a factor
analysis has been run to define a set of orthogonal (i.e. non correlated) factors about
positive and negative experience by the sample of respondents during the visit. Second,
a TSC analysis has been run that has led to identify specific demand segments:
i.e., short staying, middle staying and long staying visitors. As a final step, a regression
analysis has been run with the inclusion of a set of socio-demographic and
economic determinants as well as the outcome variables obtained in the previous steps
(i.e. the factors and cluster variables). This approach has the advantage to be applied
without any a priori hypothetical construct, as required, for example in SEM.
From a methodological point of view, the strength of this study has been the use of
an integrated approach to identical questionnaires, and the investigation of the impact
of the same combination of categorical and other quantitative variables on museum
attendance. Data were gathered on a representative sample of respondents interviewed

at two important archaeological museums in Italy, that present a rather similar
mission. The Sanna Museum located in the Island of Sardinia, that hosts a unique
archaeological collection of the so-called Megalithic Nuragic civilisation; the Ötzi
Museum that hosts a well-preserved prehistoric ice mummy and his artefacts that,
thanks to the use of new generation technologies, are still shedding light on human life
in prehistoric times.
On balance, rather homogeneous results have been found proving the reliability of
the approach. The findings have shown that these two museums here analysed need to
be reinterpreted and reorganised in a wider context able to satisfy a broader audience
that is looking for a global experience that includes leisure, culture, education and
social interaction. However, new policies need to be implemented based on visitors’
characteristics and attitudes, and able to attract new segments of demand and
especially the young generation. Future research would be aimed at investigating the
role of potentially hidden variables. As an example, respondents’ language skills may
influence their future loyalty to a cultural site in a foreign destination or their
recommendation to others through word-of-mouth as well as social networks as a key
marketing channel. Besides, the negative impact on repeat visitation by organised
groups may be due to the overall distance people have to travel to reach their
destination. Hence, a deeper investigation may also be carried out to analyse the
behaviour of organised groups to a museum in other regional contexts in order to be
able to further generalise the present findings.
On the whole, the methodological approach presented in this paper may be used
as a tool for practitioners and curators to uncover features of their consumers
as well as further dimensions of service quality and, on this basis, improve the overall
services offered.
