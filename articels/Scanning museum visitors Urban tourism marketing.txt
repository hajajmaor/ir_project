Abstract: The role of museums in developing urban tourism is researched
with special attention to the motivation constructs
of visitors and the possible added value of a “museumpark”.
Interviews
with visitors were held in order to identify
their motivation.
The laddering
technique
was used to analyze the data. Both the interviews and the survey results can be
used for the purpose of strategic
positioning
of the museum and cultural urban tourism.
Marketing
implications
can be deduced from core motives. In addition, for urban authorities
and tourism marketers,
the motivation and behavior patterns of museum visitors offer interesting clues when developing
an attractive
urban tourism
product. Keywords: museum,

INTRODUCTION
As a rule, perspectives on urban tourism tend to be strongly based
on, or biased by, the current success of cultural tourism (Law 1994).
However, there are many reasons to question
the motivation
of
cultural
tourists.
Concerning
the tourist,
there still is a lack of
empirical knowledge of the actual pull factors, the behavior patterns
on site and, above all, the visitors’ appreciation
of the urban tourist
opportunity
spectrum.
On the supply side, developers,
promoters,
and managers of the urban tourism product and cultural amenities
are now facing a major challenge to market urban cultural products,
not knowing exactly about the incentives of visitors to visit a city or
a particular
museum (Ashworth
1994). It is very often taken for
granted that “cultural tourists” are genuinely interested
in the wide
range of cultural heritage which a city has to offer and this implies,

almost by definition,
a visit to the local museum (Prentice
1993). In
many tourism marketing plans, museums are considered to be a core
element in the urban attraction
and a crucial element in generating a “high-quality”
urban environment.
However, typical to the
product is the fact that the consumer finally decides on the composition of it. Therefore,
a museum can be regarded as an intermediary in the process of creating
a final product, being an intangible
but highly valued set of experiences
(Smith 1994).
The role of museums in the development
of an urban tourism
product and especially in the image building of a “cultural” destination needs to be assessed. This question has become very relevant
with regard to the current promotion
policies in many European
cities. Urban authorities
seldom question the effectiveness
of their
policy, nor the critical
issues in the assumed association
between
museums
and cultural
tourism,
in particular
not from a visitor’s
point of view (Hansen-Verbeke
1989).

MUSEUMS

AS ATTRACTIONS

FOR

URBAN

TOURISM

In a city like Rotterdam
with a low profile as a tourism destination, it is a challenge to develop an attractive tourism product. It still
holds a marked image as a working city, a harbor city and a business
center. When compared to many historic cities in the Netherlands,
Rotterdam
has a serious handicap in attracting
tourists. Its historic
fabric was, to a large extent, destroyed by a dramatic air raid in the
Second World War. All post-war investments
have been targeted on
rebuilding
a city in which to work and live. Urban environmental
qualities such as cultural facilities and recreational
amenities
were
not a primary concern in the post-war urban reconstruction.
The lack
of a “tourism image” is now regarded as a problem by local authorities and tourism agencies; and lately the move from a “working city”
towards a “leisure city” has become an important issue on the political agenda (van den Berg, van der Borg and van der Meer 1994).
Recently,
an alderman
even announced
Rotterdam’s
ambition
to
become the “Cultural
Capital of Europe” for the year 2000. With
such an ambitious
plan to develop an urban tourism product, the
possible role of some traditional
local museums is being reassessed.
Urban tourism
planning
is now focusing on the clustering
of
cultural facilities,
a policy of spatial concentration
which is inspired
by several examples in other cities. The concept of a “museumpark”
or “museumquarter”
seems to offer some strategic advantages.
The
potential
synergism between museums, located within each other’s
vicinity
(physical
clustering)
and the possible
advantages
of a
common marketing
strategy (including a functional
clustering
and
synergetic
effects)
look very promising
and strongly inspire the
current
marketing
strategy
of developing
and promoting
the
museumpark
as a key attraction

product
(Jansen-Verbeke
and Ashworth
1991).
The “Rotterdam
Museumpark”
includes
a museum
for modern
architecture,
a
museum of natural history, a local art museum, a gallery for temporary art exhibitions,
and a line arts museum.
The expectations
are that physical clustering will generate synergistic effects
and hence
improve
the overall
attraction
of the
“museumpark”.
The number of visitors to each of the museums
separately would be less than the total attraction.
Nevertheless,
the
underlying
assumption
that the individual
museum
can really
benefit from the promotion of the “museumpark”
can be questioned.
First, there is a diversity of target groups attracted by each museum.
The visitors’ profile in the museum of natural history may be very
different from that of visitors in the line arts museum. Second, there
is the question of how to benefit from locational
advantages;
and
how many museum visitors are inclined to combine several museum
visits during one day? In many ways the added value of the marketing
concept
“museumpark”
still
needs
to be
investigated.
Understanding
the actual
motivation
and behavior
patterns
of
museum visitors can lead to a more realistic evaluation of the attractiveness of museums as elements of the urban tourist product.
Study Method
An identification
of the “cultural”
tourist
and the “museum
visitor” was seen as a first step in the process of assessing the potentials of the “museumpark
strategy”
in view of the urban tourism
development
policy. The survey was carried out among visitors to one
of the museums
(an art museum)
located in the museumpark.
Insight into the motivations
of visitors is considered
to be most
relevant to the current management
task of developing an innovative museum marketing
plan.
The laddering technique
was chosen as an appropriate
research
tool to assess the actual meaning of a museum visit as a cultural
tourism activity. Thirty in-depth interviews
were held in order to
trace the motives behind the decision to actually visit the museum.
This was followed by a survey among visitors, with the intention to
rate each of the previously identified motives.
An initial question concerns the meaning of the museum visit in
the context of other leisure activities.
In order to reconstruct
the
scene of the decision-making
process, the Kelly Repertory
Grid
proved to be a most appropriate research tool. Prior to the interviews,
alternatives
for spending leisure time were explored,
in an open
interview with about 100 museum visitors. Twenty most frequently
mentioned
options were registered
on cards, which were then used
in the Kelly Grid interviews (Kelly 1955). The procedure includes a
confrontation
of the respondents
with sets of three cards on which
different
leisure activities
are suggested. The interviewer
requests
the respondent to point out which of the three cards is different from
the other two and with respect to which motive. Then they are asked
to explain their preferences,
either the card singled out or the two
others. This procedure is repeated for several combinations.

JANSEN-VERBEKE

AND VAN REKOM

367

The interviews
were carried out using the laddering
technique
(Reynolds and Gutman 1988). This is a research technique based on
the criteria previously determined
by the Kelly Grid method. The
respondent
is repeatedly
asked to explain why he/she considers a
particular
motive as being important.
Each time the respondent
indicates
a statement
as being important,
the interviewer
insists
again and again on the question “why is that important to you?” The
outcome of this interview technique
is an associative
networks of
ladders,
which Reynolds
and Gutman
used for product
image
research. The network is supposed to reveal the motives underlying
consumer-choice
behavior and the association
pattern activated
in
choice situations.
The graphic representation
of such a network is
known as a hierarchical
value map (Reynolds and Gutman
1988).
In total, 30 interviews
were held. The results of the museum
visitors’ survey allow the construction
of a hierarchical
value map
which reflects
the collective
view of the visitors to this specific
museum. A particular motive needs to be mentioned by a significant
number of respondents
in order to be included on the map. In this
way motives may be generalized
across the population of museum
visitors. In order to avoid individual
idiosyncracies
in the use of
words, a means-end
relationship
between
two motives had to be
mentioned
by at least two different
respondents.
The hierarchical
value map of Figure 1 contains the 24 most frequently
mentioned
motives, including their interrelationships.
The most practical way to read the hierarchical
value map (Figure
1) is to start from the most central motive. This is the motive which
has the strongest links with the other ones in the figure. This core
motive can be seen as a central theme, around which other ones are
clustered.
According
to this study, the most central motive is “to
learn something”.
“ Learning” can be achieved by (following the lines
downwards)
“visiting a museum”,
by “watching works of art”, by
“seeing
something
new”, and by “placing
yourself
in others’
positions”. “Learning” is important in order to “find out something”,
for “quality of life”, in order to “talk with other people”, to “feel
satisfied”,
to be able to “make good use of your impressions”,
and
in order to “enrich your life”.
“Enriching
your life”, in turn, is the second core motive in the
which
can be achieved,
among
others,
by “learning
figure,
something”
and is important in order to “be given food for thought”
and “not to stand still in life”. In fact, the core motive in this
construct
is strongly congruent
with “learning
something”.
It is
interesting
to see that McLean
(1994) found a similar prominence
of the educational
aspect
with visitors
to Scottish
museums.
Obviously, “learning”,
in its broadest sense, is a principal motive for
visiting a museum (Falk and Dierking
1992). The congruence
with
results reported earlier in the literature
support the validity of the
laddering
technique
which was applied in the context
of this
museum study (Falk and Dierking
1992; McLean
1994).
The Hierarchical
Value Map shows the motivation
structure
of
visitors to the museum (Figure 1). This map is based on a sample
of 30 respondents
only, which is too limited to assess the linkage

pattern
between
motives fully. Therefore,
the results need to be
tested with an additional survey, Questionnaires
were distributed
on
site in which respondents were asked to rank the motives in the map
and to report about other activities during their visit in Rotterdam.
They were requested
to rate the 24 aspects included in the map
(Figure
1) concerning
the museum in Rotterdam
and four other
leading museums in the Netherlands.
The introduction
of a table, in
which several options had to be rated simultaneously,
is an appropriate format and method to reveal the respondents’
preferences
(Driscoll, Lawson and Niven 1994).
Factor analysis allowed the researchers
to identify more precisely
the three
main factors.
The first factor, “learning
something”
explains 24% of the variance and corresponds
to the most central
motive. The second factor, “enriching
life”, corresponds
to the
second core motive and explains another 9% of the variance.
The
accounts for another 6%. As a matter of
third factor, “relaxation”,
fact, the three factors correspond
to three of the five main motives
to “visit a museum” (Figure 1).
Another sample of respondents
was asked to indicate, on a seven
point scale, the strength
of the association
between two motives.
This leads to assessing
the strength
of all possible links between
motives. The results of this exercise are represented
in an additive
tree (Figure
2) in which the external
nodes correspond
to the
motives (Sattath
and Tversky 1977). The input into the tree is the
degree to which respondents
consider two motives to be associated.
The distance between is the sum of the length of all horizontal arcs
on the path linking them. This distance reflects the average strength
of the association
between
two motives. The horizontal
distance
from the root, also called “height”,
reflects
the average distance
from all other motives. It can be seen as a measure of a motive’s
centrality
within the respondents’
world of thought.

Marketing Implications
The hierarchical
value map represents
a motivation construct and
reveals
the core motives of the respondents.
The heights,
the
distance
to the root of the additive
tree, complete
the picture
(Figure 2). The lower the “height”, the more prominent
the motive
is in the respondents’
world of thought (Table 1). The Spearman
rank correlation
between the additive tree height and the degree of
perceived importance
amounts to 69%, significant
at the 1% level.
These results include several interesting
marketing
implications,
starting from the core motives. In fact, the interpretation
of both
the hierarchical
value map (Figurel)
and the additive tree (Figure
2) suggest the motivation
construct
of visitors, which can be used
efficiently
as a guideline for marketing
purposes, in particular
the
linkage pattern resulting from the qualitative
research
(Figure 1).
The relative ranking of motives which are directly linked with the
core motives can be seen in Table 1. It is feasible in any positioning
statement
to refer to a fairly large number of motives which are
particularly
relevant to the museum visitors by knowing the degree

of association
between motives and by emphasizing
the core motive
only (Figure 3).
For each link or motive, taken from the interview results, two
checks were made. First, the quantitative
results prove the existence
of a link, which can be seen as an additional check on the validity
of the relations found in the laddering interviews. All linkages shown
in Figure 3 have, on average, been rated as “strong” or “very strong”.
Second, in view of the recommendations
for positioning the museum,
its performance
on these specific items was compared to the performance of other museums. The significance
of differences
was tested
both with the Mann-Whitney
U-test and the t-test. On none of the
items was the performance
of the fine arts museum in Rotterdam
significantly
lower than the performance
of the other museums.
Table 1 suggests that the most prominent
motive is “food for
thought”. This motive is directly linked with “learning something”
and “enriching
your life”. These
are indeed strongly associated

motives. Again, following the linkage pattern in Figure 1, “learning
something”
is a means to reach “quality of life” (the fourth motive
in Table l), which fulfils the role of the final payoff - the “driving
force” (Olson and Reynolds 1983). Another association with “enriching your life” is “not to stand still in life”, which also leads to a
higher quality of life. Apparently, an important
means to reach the
goal of “learning something”
is “visiting a museum”, another way to
reach this same goal is “seeing something
new”, which clearly one
can achieve when visiting a museum. This research method enables
one to identify the core motives of museum visitors, an exercise
which is most informative
in view of the marketing
task which
museums
are now facing. Figure 3 shows how a straightforward
positioning can be derived from the research data. The task then is
to translate
these findings
into a communication
strategy
and
specific promotional
actions.
Museum visitors were asked to indicate their reasons for coming
to Rotterdam
(Table 2). For 53.5% of the respondents
the visit to
the fine arts museum was mentioned
as a primary reason, whereas
23.1% mentioned
more generally, a visit to one or more museums.
In fact, 77% of the sample can be identified as intentional
museum
visitors. Therefore,
museum visits may very well function as a pull
factor on urban visitors,
assuming
that the attraction
is strong

enough to explain the propensity to travel to places. However, this
strong emphasis on the “museum visit” as a motive for a city trip
may, to a large extent, be explained
by the actual location of this
survey and consequently
the specific characteristics
of the sample.
Museums
appear to have a real potential
to attract
tourists to
cities. Nearly half of the total number of museum visits in the
Netherlands
is part of a day trip during which the visit to the
museum is mentioned
as the main activity (CBS 1994). In fact,
combined visits frequently
occur. In the Rotterdam
case study, 16%
of the respondents
reported visiting two or more museums on their
day trips.

JANSEN-VERBEKE

AND VAN REKOM

373

A way of capitalizing
on the museum pull factors could be to
communicate
on urban tourism
attractions
following
the model
which has resulted from the survey in the fine arts museum. Urban
tourism promoters could (re)design their communication
strategy by
taking into account the expectations
and experiences
of visitors, for
which purpose the results of the museum survey offer some interesting clues. Undoubtedly,
it makes sense to emphasise strongly the
wide spectrum of experiences
which the city has to offer. This can
be communicated
by explicitly
referring
to the different
points of
interest where or by which the visitor can “learn something” in such
a way as to get “food for thought” and to be able to “enrich his life”.
With some creativity,
such attractions
can be integrated
in the
promotion of urban tourism.
The expected synergism between museums and urban tourism in
general requires a set of preconditions
which needs to be planned in
of the
visitors’
full
understanding
appreciation.
Developing
“people-place-product”
combinations
in which
museums
can
function
as a core attraction
assumes
insight
into the visitors’
motivations
to be there or visit the place. According
to Falk and
visitors

Dierking
(1992),

Non-visitors

to feel at ease and to be active. Moreover,

visitors see “learning
as an opportunity for
about it with other people”, and consequently
social interaction.
If this message
could be communicated,
the
number of museum visits might be considerably
increased.
CONCLUSIONS
Apparently there is a strong tendency among urban tourism developers and promoters of urban cultural tourism to refer to museums
between
as principal
attractions
for visits. So far, the association
cultural tourism, the future of many urban tourism markets, and the
presence of museums has hardly been addressed. However in terms
of pull factors it is necessary to understand the motivation construct
of visitors. Museums can indeed be an efficient
marketing
instrument for urban tourism. However, such an approach can only be
effective by referring to the actual motivation construct of the potential museum visitor and by fully understanding
the preferred combination of activities.
In the Rotterdam
case study, different research tools were experimented with in order to understand
the visitors’ motives. Clearly
the incentive for many museum visitors seems to have been “food
and to “enrich their life”. The
for thought”, to “learn something”
results of this study confirm the centrality
of “learning something”,
previously also reported by, for instance,
McLean
(1994) and Falk
and Dierking
(1992).
The challenge
now lies in communicating
widely and strategically
about this association
between
museum
visit, urban tourism, and individual learning opportunities.
In this

374

MUSEUM

VISITORS

perspective,
museums can indeed be viewed as potential strong pull
factors in the urban cultural tourism attraction.
In the city of Rotterdam,
where tourism is not really a traditional
urban function, the potentials of different attractive museums can be
fully explored in order to increase the number of urban tourists. The
advantages of a museumpark,
the physical clustering of a number of
museums, which is very much a top-down planning concept, are not
yet fully used in the marketing
strategies.
So far the anticipated
synergism between the different museums in the museumpark
is not
realized. The fact that most museum visitors in the survey were
unaware
of these
opportunities
or even the existence
of a
museumpark,
indicates at least a communication
default. However,
the results of this study indicate the genuine potentials
of such a
cluster by capitalizing
on the key pull factors and by targeting the
market segment which already has a higher than average interest in
museums. “Visiting a museum” as a means to reach a higher quality
of life is a central association in the actual perception of many urban
tourists. Therefore,
in urban promotion activities, it is important to
emphasize
this association
and to reveal the opportunities
which
many cities have to meet these expectations
of visitors. 0 0
