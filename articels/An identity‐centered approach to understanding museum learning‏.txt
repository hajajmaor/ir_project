Abstract
In this study we analyze perception of authenticity by visitors of South Tyrol’s museum of archeology,
best known as Ötzi museum, in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano (Italy). With the help of factor
analysis we individuate two factors related to authenticity and study the determinants of the perception
of authenticity by the visitors. Individuated factors are then employed to explain visitors’ behavior at
the museum. In particular, we study how perception of authenticity is related to the time visitors spend
at the museum. Next we investigate the influence of authenticity on shopping behavior of museum
visitors. The relevant data were obtained from a survey undertaken in the months from June to August
2010 at site. The empirical findings provide important insights for the management of the Ötzi
museum.

1. Introduction
The concept of authenticity is of particular importance for heritage management as authenticity is
driven force for tourists to travel to distant places
Nowadays tourists quest for authenticity becomes determinant factor in the provision of cultural
heritage offering. Authenticity is especially important for museum visitors. Many authors confirm that,
authenticity is the central theme of contemporary museums (Prentice, 2001).
Most of scholar research in the field of museum research concentrated on the evaluation of authenticity.
The main question in these studies is whether a certain site is perceived as authentic or not, and why
(Waitt, 2000). Few attempts have been made to disentangle the determinants of authenticity besides
using demographic characteristics to explain it (Wait, 2000). One of these attempts is the study by
Kolar and Zabkar (Kolar and Zabkar, 2010) that relates cultural motivations to existential and objectbased dimensions of authenticity. Goulding (2000) evidenced three types of visitors based on their
perception of authenticity. For ‘existential’ visitors the most important motivation for visiting is
enjoyment and escape. They mainly perceive authenticity through exhibited artefacts. ‘Aesthetical’
visitors perceive history mainly through art. ‘Social’ visitors are looking for learning and social
experiences. Their main interest lies in assisting demonstrations and acquiring souvenirs in museum
shops.
The concept of authenticity is used to explain probability to return to the museum or recommend it to
friends and relatives, loyalty dimension. Kolar and Zabkar (2010) find that cultural motivations,
existential and object-based authenticity altogether influence loyalty to the site.
Our research is based on a case of South Tyrolean Museum of Archaeology. This museum documents
the Ancient History of the South Tyrol and presents outstanding finds from the Prehistory (Stone Age,
the Bronze Age, the Iron Age), Roman times, to the time of Charlemagne (around 800 AD). Within
this museum, the Iceman (best known as "Ötzi") occupies a central position in the exhibition area and
is without doubt one of the main attractions. In 1991, an intact glacier mummy of more than 5,000
years ago was discovered in the Alps (Schnal Valley glacier), together with his accompanying artifacts
(clothing and equipment). This was an extraordinary finding that provided a unique sight into the life of
a man of the Chalcolithic Period who was travelling at high altitudes. Thus, the museum hosts unique
historical treasure.
There are little doubts with regards to the authenticity of the mummy of Iceman, the object of our
research. Our main interest in the present study is to what kind of authenticity gives rise the story of
Iceman; what are the determinants of this phenomenon and how it affects museum visitors’ behavior.

The representative sample consists of 724 visitors to the museum. To address these questions several
research technics are implemented. We use factor analysis to determine the main factors that constitute
the perception of authenticity. With the help of ordinary linear squared regression we explore the
determinants of the components of authenticity. Next, we justify and implement Tobit regression to
explore how perceptions of authenticity affect the length of the museum visit and shopping behavior at
museum shop. Our findings will help museum marketers to better structure promotion campaign.
Managers are given precious insights on how to improve visitor’s flows. Moreover, knowing the
determinants of the shopping expenditure at the museum store will help managers to develop
assortment of souvenirs and better manage their stock.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, literature review is provided on relevant research
on authenticity and its relation to museums. In Section 3 the case study is described. Section 4 collects
empirical research. In this section we describe research methods and provide account of empirical
findings. Discussion and conclusions are provided in the last section.
2. Literature review on authenticity in research on museums
There is no general agreement in the literature on what constitutes authenticity and how to evaluate it.
In particular, the dispute is whether authenticity is an objectively identifiable property of objects and
cultures, or a subjective, socially and individually constructed perception of them. As reported by
Hughes (1995), MacCannell has been one of the first academics dealing with authenticity in tourism.
Almost four decades ago, MacCannell (1973) introduced the concept of authenticity or better “staged
authenticity” to sociological studies of tourism motivations and experiences (Wang, 1999). Since then
this topic has gradually become an issue of particular interest in tourism field (Wang, 1999).
MacCannell’s interpretation of authenticity was based on object’s or experience’s degree of originality.
Judging objects or experiences according to their extent of genuineness assumes that there is an
absolute, objective criterion (i.e., a tangible origin) against which to gauge it.
Alternative view is that tourists’ can have authentic experiences even when they are perfectly aware that
the setting has been modified to please tourists (Cohen, 1988). In this way Cohen (1988) draws on the
concept of “staged authenticity” introduced by MacCannell (1973). As described by Cohen (1988),
more and more artificial cultural products are “staged” to please tourists. These products pretend to
appear authentic although they are the result of a growing pressure for “spectacular, exotic and
titillating attractions” to be shown to tourists (Boorstin, 1964, cited by Cohen, 1988).
Another important question is about the source of authenticity, what can be authentic. According to
Wang (1999) there is a need to distinguish between authenticity related to objects and authenticity
based on bodily feelings and self-making. Thus, a sharp distinction is drawn between object-based
3

authenticity and existential authenticity that can be completely independent from each other.
Most of scholar research in the field of museum research concentrated on the evaluation of authenticity.
The main question in these studies is whether a certain site is perceived as authentic or not, and why
(Waitt, 2000). Few attempts have been made to disentangle the determinants of authenticity besides

enjoyment and escape. They mainly perceive authenticity through exhibited artefacts. ‘Aesthetical’
visitors perceive history mainly through art. ‘Social’ visitors are looking for learning and social
experiences. Their main interest lies in assisting demonstrations and acquiring souvenirs in museum
shops. While, Chhabra et al. (2003) found that involved and knowledgeable tourists perceive higher
levels of authenticity.
The concept of authenticity is used to explain probability to return to the museum or recommend it to
friends and relatives, loyalty dimension. Kolar and Zabkar (2010) find that cultural motivations,
existential and object-based authenticity altogether influence loyalty to the site.
3. Bolzano as cultural destination
Bolzano is a city of approximately 104,000 inhabitants, and the provincial capital of the autonomous
province of Trentino Alto Adige, situated in the North-East of Italy (Figure 1). The economy is based
on tourism, high-quality intensive agriculture (including wine, fruit and dairy products), traditional
handicraft (wood, ceramics) and advanced services. Bolzano combines different cultures that blend
Italian and North-European architectonic features. Churches, palaces, castles and museums are of most
artistic value.
In the last two decades, the city has experienced a new impulse to the cultural life that brought the
openings of numerous museums as well as multiple summer and winter events, such as the “Christmas
Markets”. The city has a diversified cultural offer, that ranges from enogastronomic activities in the
valleys, to mountain holiday and well- known cultural events, such as Südtirol Jazz Festival and Bolzano
Festival.
Bolzano hosts also many art galleries as “Galleria Goethe”, “Galleria Civica”, “Galleria Les Chances de
l'Art” and since1905 has opened the first museum of the entire region, the Civic Museum of Bolzano.
A number of other museums have been opened in the last two decades. This growing trend shows a
increasing attention towards arts and culture: in 1985, the “Museion”, a modern and contemporary art

museum; in 1995, the “Schulmuseum”, a museum of the school, the first one of this genre in Italy,
based on the Mittel- Europe experience; in 1997, the Natural Science museum of Alto Adige; in 1998,
the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, a Mercantile Museum, the “Dommuseum” opened in 2007
and the Technikmuseum (opened in 2005) the first virtual museum in the province that hosts the
technical achievements in the past 200 years; Bolzano has the oldest cableway in the world. It is also
has a “nativity scene” (presepio) Museum, in addition, in 2006, the Firmian Castle of Bolzano was
devolved as a museum center for the Messner Mountain Museum project. Referring to the latter and to
the South Tyrol’s Museum of Archaeology, the Sunday Times (The Sunday Times, May 31, 2006)
described Bolzano as the “world’s centre of mountain history and achievement”.
The Archaeological museum, opened on March 1998, hosts the world’s best-known and well-preserved
mummies, Ötzi the Iceman. An intact body from the Copper Age, along with his clothing and
equipment, that was accidently discovered in 1991 in the Ötzal Alps where it had been preserved for
more than 5,000 years. This extraordinary find, as a unique case in the world, has attracted researchers
from around the world, and has become the main cultural pole of the city of Bolzano. The museum is
approximately 1200mq and the entire first floor is dedicated to the Iceman findings. It has a permanent
exhibition on Alto Adige’s pre-historical and history, and also hosts temporary exhibitions. Since it’s
opening, it counted around 250,000 visitors per year.
From a theoretical perspective, in the literature (see Evans, 2005), three models can be identified
through which cultural activity is included into the urban regeneration process: the culture-led
regeneration model, where the cultural activity has a high-public profile and is frequently cited as a
symbol of regeneration; the cultural regeneration model, where culture is fully integrated into an ad hoc
strategy along with other activities in the environmental, social and economic field (see e.g. the case of
Barcelona in Balibrea, 2001). Finally, the cultural and regeneration model, where culture activity is not
strategically integrated, and the planning and intervention is of small-scale. The city of Bolzano can be
included into a cultural regeneration framework. Nowadays, the city of Bolzano offers a best practice
example of cultural city. This is also confirmed by economic and environmental indicators that rank
Bolzano as the Italian city with the highest standard of quality of life (Sole 24 Ore, 2010). Besides, the
province of Bolzano ranks first in terms of economic freedom. Such a measure is estimated taking into
account 38 indicators of its overall performance such as: Bolzano is the richest province in Italy in
terms of GDP per capita with more than thirty six thousand euro per resident, 2.6 times higher than
the poorest province of Crotone. Besides, Bolzano city accounts for a rate of poverty of 4% of total
province population (in the South of Italy it reaches 40%). It ranks second in terms of unemployment
rate that reaches 2.8%, against the Italian average of 7.7% - as a matter of fact in Bolzano one in two
women is employed. The average public expenditure in services is 417 euro, against a national average
5

of 91 euro per capita (NuovaCosenza, 2011). Overall, Bolzano can be regarded as a province of
excellence having a high performance in terms of business, jobs, public security, environment, health
and well-being. These outstanding figures provide further evidence that Bolzano is actually following a
sustainable path of growth within a culture and regeneration framework.
4. Empirical analysis
4.1 Research design
We base our measure of authenticity on the typology developed in Wang (1999). Wang expresses the
view that authenticity is a complex construct that includes several dimensions. The most important
dimension of authenticity for heritage sites is object-based authenticity (Naoi, 2004, Waitt, 2000). The
object-based component of authenticity refers to perceptions of architecture, impressions of buildings,
peculiarities about the interior design of the sites and the streetscape. We assess these object-based
elements in the sense of appropriateness of the hosting building and areas to the main goal of the
museum: telling the story of the Iceman. The existential component of authenticity relates to the
perceptions, feelings and emotions of museum visitors, such as ‘uniqueness of experience or ‘feeling
the historic era’. The notion of ‘getting closer to history’ is found to be the most important for
experiencing the authenticity of heritage sites (Chhabra et al., 2003, Naoi, 2004). The context of the
archeological museum and the history of Iceman were considered in the development of the
measurement items.
We also collect information on cultural motivations of museum visitors. Previous research finds
positive relationship between cultural motivations and perceived authenticity (Chhabra, 2003).
In this study our interest is in how the concept of authenticity is related to the … of relevance for the
management of museum, namely, the length of stay at the museum, expenditure on museum’ souvenirs
and loyalty.
The survey was administered at the Ötzi museum in Bolzano, from June to August 2010, via face-toface interviews, with the aim to determine museum impact on the territory. The respondents were
selected with a quota random sampling procedure based on age and gender trying to capture
heterogeneous demographics features. Finally, 724 complete interviews were successfully concluded.
The questionnaire contained in total 36 questions, organized in four blocks: the first section asked trip
information, the next demanded information about the city of Bolzano, then information on the visit
to the museum are collected and, as the last section, a sequence of questions on socio-economics
characteristics of the visitors. In the questions on how important is to visit Bolzano and the museum,
information, motivation, satisfaction and loyalty a Likert scale was used ranging from ‘not important’ to
6

‘very important’ for the motivation factors, from ‘strongly in disagreement’ to ‘strongly in agreement’
for assessing tourist’s satisfaction, and from ‘very unlikely’ to ‘very likely’ for the loyalty factors.
Possibility to reply ‘I do not know’ was given to respondents.
4.2 Description of the sample
We analyze main characteristics of the sample in order to give a better understanding of visitors’ profile
and expenditure pattern (Table 1). Most of the visitors (69%) came from other European countries
rather than Italy. They are mostly male (55%), generally married or de-facto(80%), with a family of 3-4
members (51%); those between 41 and 55 years old are more interested in the museum visitation (52%)
if compared to other age range. Regarding the education level, 49% had a college degree or a higher
degree. As far as income is concerned, 40% of the sample had a middle-high average income, while just
3% earn up to 20.000 euros per year.
It is important to notice that for 58% of the sample is their first time in Bolzano and for 90% is their
first visit to the Archeological Museum. The great part (62%) would equally visit the city even if it were
not hosting Ötzi, that however has an enormous potentiality to attract tourists considered that 63% is
willing to visit another city that would host it. Also, 11% expressed a strong intention to revisit the
museum the following year, while 24% had a strong intention to come back to Bolzano and 40% would
strongly recommend the city to relatives and friends. Besides, 56% declared that they will very likely
advise relatives and friends to visit this museum.
Given the definition, 95% of the sample can be identified as tourists, since they spend at least one night
outside the habitual place of residence. Considering the family unit that spends at least one night out,
the average expenditure for accommodation is approximately 96 euros per night, while 61 euros for
food and beverage. On balance, visitors have a higher spending propensity in the museum shop, as well
as in doing shopping in the city, than daily visitors (see Table 1). The descriptive statistics provide an
insight into the attractiveness of this outstanding archaeological find and the role that the museum has
in the urban context.

4.3 Authenticity analysis
4.3.1. Methodology
We use factor analysis to derive the underlying dimensions of the object-based and existential
authenticity. The present survey instrument contains a list of 15 items that define authenticity. Formally,
the following model can represent factor analysis:
av = Λf + Ξ,

(1)

where av corresponds to the matrix of visitors responses to authenticity items; f captures the matrix of
factor scores that places visitors with respect of the authenticity factors; Λ is a matrix of factor loadings
that shows correlations between the answers on authenticity items and individual factor scores and Ξ
corresponds to the matrix of residual terms.
Factor analysis consists in the definition of covariance matrix of the observed answers to authenticity
items
cov av = ΛΛ! + Ω.
This covariance matrix is broken down in two components: a common component, called the
communality (ΛΛ! ) and a unique component, called the specific variance (Ω). This analysis permits to
describe the proportion of variance in the observed variables that is determined by the authenticity
factors by analyzing the communalities scores matrix. However, the communalities are not known.
Thus, there is a need to estimate the communalities in a way that the underlying factor structure can
8
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1920743

reproduce them as well as possible.
In the empirical work presented here we proceed in the following way. First, we conduct exploratory
analysis in which initial common factors are extracted. Next, we conduct confirmatory analysis in which
we test how well the factor structure is supported by the data. Finally, estimation results of common
factors are presented followed by corresponding interpretation.
4.3.2. Results of the factor analysis
First we identify common factors that determine authenticity. At this stage we do not specify the
number of factors to be retained. Calculations are made with the use of Stata 11. Estimation results are
presented in the table 2. The values above 0.5 are flagged with the star. Exploratory analysis gives rise
to two main factors with corresponding Eigen values of 5 and 1,34. These values are higher than 1 and
thus the factors’ contribution to the variance is higher than contribution of a single variable.

Next, we proceed with confirmatory analysis. We test the appropriateness of the two-factor structure
by computing Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO). The KMO measure for the
given specification reaches 0.917, which indicates ‘marvelous’ adequacy of the structure. It means that
variables considered in the analysis can be explained by two common factors and this description is
excellent.
We can conceptually describe the identified factors:
Factor 1 collects items that refer to perception and feelings of visitors. Concepts like ‘Ötzi is unique in
the world’ or ‘It is a way to describe a historical era’ position this factor as expression of existential
authenticity. A higher score on this factor indicates strong perception of existential authenticity.

Factor 2 collects a number of items that evaluate appropriateness of the museum building and its rooms
to tell the fascinating story of the Iceman. Being related to the objects we identify it as object-based
authenticity.
4.3.3 Determinants of authenticity factors
Finally, we can compute individual authenticity scores. Based on equation (1) we can compute f, the
matrix of individual factor scores.
In order to understand better each individual authenticity score we run a linear regression model:
f!",! = a!"# +
f!"#,! = a!"#$ +

!

a!,!" x!,! + u!",!
! a!,!"# x!,!

+ u!"#,! ,

for all j respondents.

Where f!",! is a vector of individual scores on existential authenticity, x!,! is a vector with the
observations of individual socio-economic characteristic k, u!",! is a vector of disturbance terms and
a’s are coefficients to be estimated.
The following characteristics of visitors were included as explanatory variables: (a) nationality, (b) age,
(c) education level, total accommodation costs, (i) total food and beverage costs, (j) shopping
expenditure in Bolzano, (k) expenditure in the museum shop, (l) actual time spent visiting museum, (m)
expenditure on accommodation, (n) expenditure on food and beverages, (o) number of previous visits
to museum, (p) motivations for coming to the city of Bolzano, (q) number of visits to the museum.

For each factor we fit two models. Model 1 corresponds to a broader model specification. Model 2
represents specification based on significant coefficients. Regression results are presented in the table 3.
These results present some interesting information.
First of all, socio-demographic characteristics do not provide explanation of the authenticity except for
education level in the case of object-based authenticity. The corresponding coefficient carries negative
sign; it means that visitors with higher level of education find the building of the museum inappropriate
for telling the story of Iceman. In fact, the museum is situated in the historical building in the center of
the city that was originally constructed as a bank. There is an ongoing discussion in the city council
regarding the construction of the new building more suitable and more appropriate to host the mummy
of Iceman and his history.
Visitors that actually saw the mummy (the mummy is conserved in special room and visitors can
observe the mummy through a small window that is hidden in the exposition room) report higher
perceived existential authenticity.
Motivational factors of visiting the city of Bolzano and of the museum also provide explanation to
existential authenticity. Visitors that came to Bolzano to visit the museum report more existential
authenticity, while respondents that admit that they would visit Bolzano even if the museum were not
located in the city perceive less existential authenticity. Curiosity and willing to learn the story of

Iceman are the main cultural motives of visiting the museum that provide explanation to existential
authenticity. It suggests that prior preparation to the visit and motivation create the feeling of
authenticity before actually getting to the museum. Finally, respondents that came to Bolzano to relax
report more existential authenticity.
Object-based authenticity, on the other hand, is more appealing to visitors that came to Bolzano to visit
the city and other museums. Visitors reporting more object-based authenticity are those visitors that are
going to the museum to relax, to experience something different or because they follow somebody
else’s advise. Apparently, expectations of these visitors are more related to the general architecture of
the city and relaxed atmosphere of the museum than to specific motivation of learning the story of
Iceman.
Both existential and object-based concepts of authenticity are related with the probability to
recommend friends and relatives visiting the museum.
4.4 The impact of authenticity on visitors’ behavior
In the present section we present analysis of several variables of interest for museum manager, namely,
duration of the visit to the museum, expenditure in the shop of the museum, intentions to visit the
museum within next 5 years and recommend visiting the museum to friends and relatives. We will
explain these variables with the help of the authenticity factors.
4.4.1 Analysis of the duration of the visit to the museum
In the present section we analyze duration of the visit to the museum. Knowing the determinants of
this variable will help management of the museum to better manage the flows of visitors. In the
questionnaire we collected information on the duration of the visit to the museum. The average visiting
time was of 90 minutes with the minimum of 30 minutes and the maximum of 3 hours.
Our interest, therefore, is to define the We run simple linear regression model to explain the duration
of the visit to the museum
Duratıon! = a! +

! a!" x!"

+ u! ,

where Duration! is individual duration of the visit to the museum, x!,! is a vector with the observations
of individual factor loading and socio-economic characteristic k, u!",! is a vector of disturbance terms
and a’s are coefficients to be estimated. In the table 4 we present the model based only on significant
coefficients.
Visitors that report higher existential authenticity spend more time visiting the exposition. In fact,
12

subjects that observed the mummy spent around 22 minutes more at the museum. While respondents
that claim they would visit another city that hosts the Iceman spent 13 minutes more. Tourists that
came to Bolzano to visit South Tyrol also tend to spend more time inside the museum. Visitors that
planned their visit to museum time ahead spent more time at the museum reaching 11 minutes more
for respondents that decided to visit the museum a month ago. This confirms our conjecture that
preparation to the visit increases motivation.
Families with children under 6 spent relatively less time inside the exposition. Apparently, small
children get annoyed during the visit and the museum does not provide neither special rooms nor
enough relaxation areas to meet the needs of these families. Respondents that visit the museum for
work or study tend to stay less time at the museum. Tourists travelling with organized group spent
almost 22 minutes less. Organized groups are usually under time pressure and individuals probably
cannot enjoy the visit at their own pace.
Object-based authenticity did not have significant influence on the duration of the visit.

4.4.2 Analysis of expenditure at the museum shop
Analysis of the determinants of the expenditure at the museum shop is of great importance for the
management of the museum. Knowing who is your target may help the management to improve
assortment of souvenirs and better handle stock issues. In the survey we collected information on
whether respondents visited the museum shop and how much did they spend there.
Our variable of interest is, therefore, spending at the museum shop.
Spendıng_shop! = a! +

! a!" x!"

+ u! ,

The spending at the shop can take the value 0 with positive probability and it is a continuous variable
13
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1920743

over strictly positive values. In fact, individuals solve maximization problem on how much to spend.
For some of these individuals, the optimal choice will be the corner solution, Spending ! hop = 0.
Wooldridge (2002) points out that it is problematic using OLS in this setting. A recommended model
to use in this case is standard censored Tobit model.
The structural equation in the Tobit model is
y! = X! β + ε! ,
where y! is a latent variable that is observed for values greater than τ and censored otherwise. In out
case, we assume τ = 0. Thus, we have
y! =

y!
0

if y! > 0
if y! ≤ 0

Tobit model is estimated with log-likelihood. We use Stata 11 for calculations. The results of estimation
are presented in table 5.
Coefficients corresponding to existential and object-based authenticity are significant and positive. This
means that visitors that perceive the artifact as authentic from both existential and object-based point
of view are willing to spend more on souvenirs. Existential component of authenticity induces in
individuals the emotional state of excitement with regards to the story of Iceman, what psychologists
define as ‘hot’ state. They look for some reminder of this state that they find in souvenirs at the
museum shop. Object-based authenticity on the other hand is related to museum building, exposition
design and relaxing areas. More suitable relaxing areas, design of exposition rooms and bar service
allow individuals to reflect more on the story they are presented with and feel part of it. This also
contributes to the emotional excitement previously discussed and, thus, higher spending on souvenirs.
We also find that more numerous families are more willing to spend on souvenirs. It is related to a
previous finding that families with small children are spending less time on visiting the museum.
Visitors with higher educational level, in particular, those with university degree or above, are willing to
spend more on souvenirs. This finding may be related to the fact that, generally, people with higher
educational level have higher income and, as a consequence, higher propensity to spend. Unfortunately,
most of respondents preferred to not declare their income. This fact renders income not suitable for
control in our analysis. We use reports on the spending at the shops in Bolzano as a proxy of the
income level and general propensity of the sample to consume. Visitors that spend more in shops of
Bolzano also tend to spend more in the museum shop.
14
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1920743

Visitors that declare to work occasionally or on projects tend to spend significantly less at the museum
shop. This fact can be due to their relatively lower income level and uncertainty of income. On the
other hand, retired persons have higher propensity to spend on souvenirs, as indicated by significant
positive coefficient on this variable.
Visitors for whom the main reason of coming to Bolzano was to visit the museum spend more at the
shop of the museum. The same is true for respondents that declared that they have prolonged their stay
in Bolzano to visit the museum. Previous motivation of these individuals in museum makes them
spend more on souvenirs.
Nationality is not a significant determinant of the expenditure at the museum shop, as well as the fact
of being day-tourist.

5. Discussion and conclusions
In the present study we explore dimensions of authenticity observed in visitors to South Tyrol’s
Museum of Archeology. With the help of factor analysis we individuated two factors corresponding to
the distinct dimensions of authenticity, object-based and existential authenticity. We conduct analysis of
the determinants of existential and object-based authenticity. These concepts are not explained by
socio-demographic characteristics except for object-based authenticity being negatively related with
education level. We explain this negative correlation by the fact that visitors with higher education, and
presumably larger experience in visiting museums, perceive the building and hosting rooms of the
museum as inappropriate to host the story of the Iceman. As we report in the paper the building that
hosts the museum is a historical building in the center of Bolzano. This building was originally
15
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1920743

constructed to serve as a bank and structurally is ill suited to host the museum. This finding suggests
that the city should provide more appropriate and more authentic placing for Iceman mummy.
Two distinct profiles of visitors’ motivations emerge that contribute to each dimension of authenticity.
Existential authenticity is mainly explained by strong motivation of visitors to visit the museum. This
goes from reporting that visiting the museum was the main reason of coming to Bolzano to indicating
the curiosity in the story of the Iceman as the main reason of visiting museum. Observing the mummy
of the Iceman through the opposite window contributes to the rise of existential authenticity. We
hypothesize that pre visit motivation creates fertile grounds for the rise of existential authenticity. In
some sense individuals start savoring the story long time before the actual visit takes place.
Motivational profile that characterizes object-based authenticity consists of more general cultural
motivations for visiting the city and museum. Thus, visitors that expect to see general architecture of
the city and looking for relaxation when visiting the museum, general cultural tourists, are more
influenced by object-based authenticity.
The relationship between cultural motivations and perceived authenticity has been developed in
consumer-based model of authenticity developed in Kolar and Zabkar (2010). Our findings go in line
with this model as well as with the findings of Chhabra et al. (2003) who found that involved and
knowledgeable tourists perceive higher levels of authenticity. We hypothesis that these motivations
create specific expectations that visitors confirm or not during their visit. Thus, the marketers of the
museum should underline the dimension of existential authenticity in their promotion of the museum.
We find that existential authenticity, but not object-based authenticity, positively affects the length of
the visit to the museum. Observing the mummy increases the time for the visit by 22 minutes. This can
be explained by the fact that the visitor should attend in line to be able to look at the special window. It
can also be true that seeing the mummy increases the interest in the story of the Iceman. Families with
small children and organized groups spend less time at the museum.
The perception of authenticity is important in the decision to buy souvenirs. Both components of
authenticity, existential and object-based, are important for this decision. We suggest that existential
component of authenticity induces in individuals emotional state of excitement with regards to the
story of Iceman. They look for some reminder of this state that they find in souvenirs at the museum
shop. Object-based authenticity that includes among other factors suitable relaxing areas, design of
exposition rooms and bar service. These factors allow individuals to reflect more on the story they are
presented with and feel part of it. This also contributes to the previously discussed emotional
involvement and, thus, leads to higher spending on souvenirs.

The findings of this study underline the importance of previous motivation for the perception of
authenticity and higher propensity to spend at the museum shop. Museum marketers should put efforts
to build strong motivations to visit the museum in it’s potential visitors.
