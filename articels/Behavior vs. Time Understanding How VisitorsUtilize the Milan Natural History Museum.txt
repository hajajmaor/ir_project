Behavior vs. Time: Understanding How Visitors
Utilize the Milan Natural History Museum
• • • • •
GIORGIO CHIOZZI AND LIDIA ANDREOTTI

ABSTRACT

To evaluate visitors’ use of the exhibitions and the communication strategy of the
Milan Natural History Museum, we compared results gathered with two methods,
based respectively on the timing of visitors and on the unobtrusive observation of
exhibit-use behaviors. We collected data from a sample of 100 groups of visitors
(not guided), randomly selected at the museum entrance. We recorded the following data for each group: halls visited, length of stay in each hall, any kind of behavior showing visitor/exhibition interaction and the displays where interactions
occurred. The study shows that visiting time does not give enough information
about the actual use of exhibits by the audience. The investigation of visitor/exhibition interactions revealed itself to be the most usual method to describe the visitors’ use of the exhibitions. The most important factor influencing visits to the
Milan Natural History Museum is the communication technique used in the exhibition areas.

INTRODUCTION

In many studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of museum exhibitions, visiting
time has been used as an indicator of visitors’ satisfaction, the idea being that visitors
devote more time to the exhibitions they prefer (Bechtel 1967). More recently, Serrell
(1997, 1998) developed a method which, through the analysis of time-related behaviors
in different museum settings, aims to measure an exhibition’s success and how thoroughly it is used by visitors, on the assumption that “diligent visitors” (i.e., those that
stop at more than half the elements of an exhibition) spend more time in the exhibitions.
Conversely, Falk (1983) considered time to be an excellent way of understanding
visitors’ motivation and behavior, but stressed that measuring time is of no real use if one
does not consider the factors that determine the appearance of a particular behavior.

Visitors’ behavior can generally be predicted and seems to be strongly influenced by the
elapsed time of visit, no matter the efforts museum professionals put in the control of
exhibit and setting variables (Falk et al. 1985; Falk 1991).
An alternative method could therefore be based on the analysis of visitor/exhibition interaction, i.e., behaviors enacted when viewing displays: An exhibition should be
considered preferred by visitors if higher levels of interaction are recorded. By doing so,
the time factor is ruled out, since it does not influence the onset of interactions. When
an exhibition arouses the interest of a group of visitors with little time on hand, then visitors will show behaviors that do not imply prolonged stops in front of displays. On the
other hand, when visitors seem not to like a particular exhibition, visitor/exhibition
interactions will be substantially reduced and, in certain cases, fully eliminated.
The only previous visitor studies at the Milan Natural History Museum had been
a questionnaire-based survey (Magnoni et al. 1995) that collected information about
visitors’ sex, age, level of education, geographic area of origin, previous museum experience and first hand impressions of the exhibitions. Beyond this information and the
visitors’ yearly counts, not much was known about the audience of the Milan Natural
History Museum (Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano, or MSNM). More
recently, a paper described the behavior of the MSNM visitors (Andreotti and Chiozzi
1999). We performed the present research in order to test the validity of using
visitor/exhibition interactions as a key to understand how visitors use the MSNM exhibitions and to evaluate the museum’s communication policy. For this purpose we compared data obtained through timing of visits and observation of visitors’ behavior in
order to determine which of these methods is more suitable to describe visitors’ use of
the MSNM exhibitions or if these methods are both equally reliable. Finally, we evaluated if public’s reactions to the more recent communication and educational development of the MSNM exhibition strategy.

THE MILAN NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM

The exhibition halls of the MSNM are placed in a ring on two floors (5,500 m2) connected by a wide staircase. The route takes visitors through 23 halls housing 700 displays that
primarily focus on the evolutionary and ecological interpretation of natural history. Dioramas are the most striking communication technique that enlivens the exhibitions (Figure 1). The ground floor (eleven exhibition halls) deals with mineralogy and geology,
paleontology, paleoanthropology and zoology of invertebrates, and only two halls contain
dioramas (2.5% of the displays for that floor). The upper floor (twelve exhibition halls)
deals with vertebrate zoology and ecology, and ten halls have been turned into galleries
reconstructing natural environments (43.6% of the displays on this floor are dioramas).
Most visitors to the museum (64.2%) are adults who decide what they wish to see
for themselves. School trips account for 30.9% of the viewing public and these generally go on guided tours of the museum. The remaining 4.9% of the visitors are using the
library or attending conferences.

Not counting school trips, visitors belong to the following social groups: adults
with children (46%), male/female couples (23%), and groups of adults (18%). The
remainder (13%) are visitors who come alone (Andreotti and Chiozzi 1999).
The visiting public mainly comes from the town of Milan, from nearby towns and
from other provinces in Lombardy (schools: 86.8%; other visitors: 69.7%, Magnoni et
al. 1995).
A survey carried out in 1992 (Magnoni et al. 1995) reported that the education
level of the non-school public is high compared to national data: 66.1% of the visitors
have completed upper secondary schooling (the 1992 national figure was 14.3%).

We randomly selected one hundred groups of visitors (245 people) on entering
the museum. From that moment on, we followed unobtrusively the groups for the
whole duration of their visit in order to prevent the researcher from being noticed and
thus to have any effects on the observed subjects’ behavior (Borun et al. 1996; Falk
1983; McManus 1987; Peart 1984; Robinson 1928). If even one member of a group got

the impression of being studied, the whole group was then abandoned and the relative
data gathered until then were not taken into consideration. We did not include guided
tours in the study since the visiting route is strongly influenced by the guide. We also
excluded groups of more than six people to avoid any difficulties in data collection due
to the excessive number of people to monitor.
We recorded the following data for each group: halls visited, length of stay in each
hall, any kind of behavior showing visitor/exhibition interaction (cursory glance, careful
observation, brief reading, comprehensive reading, commenting, pointing, naming—
Table 1), fatigue symptoms (statement, vertical support, arms support, head support,
sitting, crouching, yawning, stretching, balancing—Table 2) and the display where interactions occurred.
Data collection took 96 hours distributed in such a way that they covered the
whole daily and weekly opening time throughout the year.
The visit was normally conducted by going from Hall 1 to Hall 11 (on the ground
floor) and going from Hall 12 to Hall 23 (on the first floor). The only variation possible
to this route was by starting off with the upstairs floor before proceeding downstairs
(only 9% of the groups chose this route). To standardize data, we took into consideration the order in which halls were visited rather than the consecutive hall number, even
though the two issues practically coincided in this case.
We considered a display to have been visited when at least one member of a
group of visitors interacted with it. Available displays were those present in each hall.
Because of the practical difficulties we found to simultaneously collect behavioral
data and collect timing data on every single visitor in detail, we theoretically calculated
the average time spent at visited displays in each hall subtracting the time used by
groups of visitors to cross the hall (as if there were no exhibit in it) from the total time
spent in the hall (a measure we could easily get during the tracking).
To calculate the “crossing time” we assumed visitors walking at an average pace of
2.5 km per hour. Thus, a hypothetical group following a track bisecting the 23 halls of
the MSNM would go across the full route in 579.5 seconds. This led us to conclude that
each hall would be crossed, on an average, in 25.2 seconds. In order to counterbalance
the differences in speed through groups and the presence of obstacles that actually precluded the possibility to march along a straight line, we rounded off the measurement to
30 seconds (0.5 minutes).
–
Mean time per visited display (tvd ) was calculated as follows:
–
tvd = Tex /VD
where Tex is the total time dedicated to the exhibits, so as to say the total time
spent in the halls minus the total time spent in crossing the halls. The first results from
the sum of partial time measurements in each hall visited by group n, while the second
is expressed by the number of halls visited by group n, multiplied by 0.5 minutes (theoretical average crossing time). VD is the total number of displays visited by group n.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to test the hypothesis that time could be properly used to evaluate the effectiveness of museum exhibitions, we considered the mean time per available display and
the mean time per visited display. In the first case, we found that time dedicated to each
available display shows a positive trend through the visit (Figure 2). This method, however, neither considers the differences between exhibit arrangements in the ground and
in the first floors of the museum, nor the displays that the public really visited. Not
allowing for these issues may actually lead us to conclude that the upstairs halls are
more appreciated by visitors than the downstairs ones.
On the other hand, the analysis of the mean time per visited display (Figure 3)
shows a negative trend through the visit. We should then conclude that visitors prefer
the downstairs displays. This approach still does not give consideration to the communication peculiarities of each hall. In fact, we do not know if visitors favored a specific
exhibition as a whole, but we can only figure out which particular displays in a hall they
preferred among the others. This ambiguity that is linked to the use of time does not
allow us to draw clear conclusions.
Falk et al. (1985) pointed out the importance of museum fatigue as a factor greatly influencing the visit by reducing the attention to exhibits. Assuming this could be generally true, the decreasing mean time per visited display (Figure 3) observed in the
MSNM agrees with the onset of fatigue symptoms (Figure 4), which increase as the visit
progresses. However, a discrepancy arises when we consider the percentage of visited
displays per available displays in each hall. The observed growing trend of this percent-

to find out that visitors would walk through the halls without stopping in front of the

MSNM and to justify the visitors’ growing interest towards the exhibits in spite of their
tiredness.
A way to solve the dilemma could be the detailed investigation of visitors’ behavior in front of displays. This would permit us to estimate the evolution of visitors’ mood
during the visit.

siderable changes as the visit progresses. More in-depth analysis emphasizes a remarkable difference between the ground floor halls (1–11) and the first floor ones (12–23).
The only behavior that follows a decreasing trend is comprehensive reading, which, in
any case, is always at a low level (at the most, visitors engage in comprehensive reading
at 7% of available displays). The frequency of all the other behaviors shows a percentage increase as the visit progresses. By comparing this element with the onset of fatigue
symptoms, which increase as the visit progresses, and with the mean time per visited display, which tends to fall, there seems to be a contradiction. The increase in the frequency of visitor/exhibition interactions can be actually explained only noting that visitors
prefer the upstairs halls to the downstairs ones. This is even more striking when frequency of interactions per hall is analyzed. Figure 7 shows that the upstairs halls
(12–23) have a greater number of interactions per available display compared to the
downstairs halls (1–11). Considering visitor/exhibition interactions per visited display
(Figure 8), halls with most frequent interactions are very often the upstairs ones, which
use dioramas as the main display technique.
The only behavior that occurs more frequently in the downstairs halls is comprehensive reading. Apart from visitors’ greater acquaintance with the topics dealt with in
the upstairs halls, the more frequent comprehensive reading downstairs may essentially
be due to two factors. Firstly, upstairs halls are visited last, hence visitors are tired and
the time they have decided to devote to the visit is nearly over. Moreover, comprehensive reading of texts requires concentration that is incompatible with museum fatigue,
while prolonged stops are incompatible with the little time remaining. Therefore, as the
visit progresses, the percentage of displays where comprehensive reading takes place
decreases. Secondly, upstairs halls use considerably different display techniques. Dioramas seem to arouse more physical involvement (more pointing, naming and commenting

behaviors) and to give visitors the impression that there is no need to carefully read texts
because dioramas appear to be able to communicate for themselves. This is supported by
the fact that in the last hall on the ground floor (Hall 11), which has about a dozen dioramas devoted to insects, the percentage of displays with comprehensive reading is
among the lowest for that floor. On the other hand, the first two halls upstairs, (12 and
13), which do not contain any dioramas, register the highest percentage for comprehensive reading.

CONCLUSION

As it can be seen from the discussion, describing how visitors utilize the exhibitions
through the analysis of mean times per visited display or per available display can lead
to contradictory results. Moreover, measuring time of visit in an aseptic way, i.e., not
considering which displays visitors really interact with and ignoring the communication
techniques used, does not give an actual picture of what effectively happens during the
visit. On the contrary, we demonstrated that through the observation of visitors’ behavior during their museum experience, we could get a neater image of what people really
like. Moreover, our evidence suggests that the two methods are not equally reliable at
all. In fact, visiting time appears not to be the main factor to influence the reactions of
visitors in front of displays. Unexpectedly, museum fatigue, which is generally considered the first enemy of museum visits, revealed itself not to be so crucial. In fact, growing fatigue symptoms do not go hand in hand with a decrease of visitor/exhibition interactions.
Visits to the MSNM are in effect strongly influenced by the communication tech-

niques used in the exhibition areas. By looking at the facts this way, it is no wonder that
visitors perceive the museum as two distinct museums in their own right. In particular,
the exhibition areas that arouse the least public response are the ones displaying many
specimens that require explanatory texts. On the other hand, the communication techniques that stimulate visitor/exhibition interactions the most are the ones where no
explanatory text is necessary. The diorama is a fitting example of this, since it is the
expression of a primary language form that is quick and often easy to understand
(Cagnolaro 1991). Observing an organism in its natural habitat (Figure 9) is something
that does not need a great deal of words, which, in any case, are not always as evocative.
Ecological contextualization also makes visitors perceive the museum as a place where
nature preservation is illustrated (Andreotti 1997). Finally, the surprise element in seeing dioramas must not be underestimated: Making visitors marvel is one of the most
effective strategies to make them formulate questions to which a good exhibition
should, at least in part, then be able to provide answers. Reading display texts, in this
case, is an important aspect, but not a compulsory one, in order to exploit the benefits
of the exhibition.
The different subject matters displayed in the halls, could, in part, explain the
dissimilar responses of the public in the two floors of the MSNM. Minerals, fossils and

invertebrate animals seem not to arouse the same intense emotional reactions that vertebrate animals and backgrounds produce while looking at the dioramas. This could
possibly be due to their more evocative power. The possible influence of the different
themes on visitor/exhibition interactions is a question that will require further testing.
Research has therefore revealed that the museum staff’s decision to focus on dioramas as a communication and educational instrument has been well rewarded by the public’s positive reaction. Carefully detailed and beautifully attractive, dioramas seem to
speak directly to the heart of visitors. They generate (with the need of only basic textual
explanations) a lot of behavioral interactions. At the same time, though, despite the great
commitment made to improve the communication style (better graphics, more readable
texts), those permanent exhibitions showing a strong collecting ethos or bookish nature
have been greatly penalized by most visitors. While certain displays (such as the pterosaur
model hanging from the ceiling, Figure 10) cause a great deal of reaction in the public,
others (such as those underneath it) largely fail to attract people. Perhaps they contain too
much to read or too many objects. This has stressed the need to make changes and
improvements in the communication strategies adopted in those sections of the museum.
