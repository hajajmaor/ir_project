Motivational Factors and the Visitor Experience:
A Comparison of Three Sites
• • • • •
JAN PACKER AND ROY BALLANTYNE
ABSTRACT

Museums, art galleries, botanical gardens, national parks, science centers, zoos,
aquaria and historic sites are important public learning institutions. The freechoice learning offered in these settings is closely linked to visitors’ intrinsic motivation, making it important to understand the motivational factors that impact on
visitors’ experiences. This paper presents data from a questionnaire administered
to visitors at three sites: a museum, an art gallery, and an aquarium. Similarities
and differences among the sites are reported in relation to visitors’ expectations,
perceptions of learning opportunities, engagement in motivated learning behaviors, and perceptions of the learning experience. The importance of learning to
museum visitors and the unique opportunities and challenges of the museum in
relation to other educational leisure settings are discussed. The authors argue
that the study of motivational factors might contribute to the development of a
common theoretical foundation for interpretation in museums and other informal
learning settings.

In recent years there has been a renewed awareness of the contribution that museums
and other educational leisure settings can make to public lifelong learning. Anderson
(1997a; 1997b), observing the rapid growth in the learning needs of society, predicted
that education will become a major industry for developed countries in the twenty-first
century and that the formal education sector alone will not be adequate to meet these
needs. As societies change from industrially-based to knowledge-based economies, lifelong and free-choice learning is gaining increasing attention (Falk and Dierking 2000).
The informal learning sector will have an increasingly important role in society, and
leisure settings will increase in their importance as venues where people acquire information, develop ideas and construct new visions for themselves and their society. Such
leisure settings may include art, history and natural history museums, botanical gardens,
nature centers, national parks, science centers, zoos, aquaria, historic houses, historic
reconstructions, heritage and archaeological sites and commercial tourism facilities.

PACKER AND BALLANTYNE • MOTIVATION AND VISITOR EXPERIENCE

Despite the important educational role of these facilities, it cannot be assumed
that all visitors to such settings have actually come to learn something. Even in museums, which have long been considered educational institutions (Anderson 1997a), it has
been suggested that, “a large percentage of visitors are there to ‘kill time’, to be entertained, to satisfy curiosity, or to ‘people watch’” (Koran and Koran 1986, 12). At the
other extreme, commercial tourism facilities including theme parks such as Disney’s
EPCOT Center, deliberately cater to their visitors’ entertainment motives, while
attempting to maintain the education element as an “added extra” (Hedge 1995).
Museums are probably the best known and most researched of all educational
leisure settings. The International Council of Museums defines a museum as “a nonprofit-making, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, and
open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits,
for purposes of study, education and enjoyment, material evidence of people and their
environment” (Anderson 1997a, xii). The term “museum” has at times been used
generically to include a range of educational leisure settings (Falk 2000; Falk and Dierking 1995; Hooper-Greenhill 1999), and these different settings are seen to have much in
common (Falk et al. 1995a). For example, educational leisure settings usually have
most, if not all, of the following characteristics:
• The setting provides direct experience with real objects, people or places (Falk et
al. 1995b; Hooper-Greenhill 1995);
• Learning is voluntary (Falk et al. 1995b);
• Learning is stimulated by the needs and interests of the learner (Hooper-Greenhill 1995);
• Learning is often socially mediated (Falk et al. 1995b);
• Visitors come alone, in small or family groups of mixed sexes, ages and subject
expertise with very diverse learning styles and prior learning experiences (Anderson 1995).
As a result of these characteristics, the opportunities for learning offered in
leisure settings differ from, and complement, the learning provided by the formal education sector (Anderson 1997a). Educational leisure settings have the potential to provide a more learner-centered experience which involves exploring and examining, making choices, making personal connections, developing one’s own way of understanding,
and controlling one’s own learning environment (Meadows 1997; Paris 1997; Schauble
et al. 1996). However, because participation is a matter of free choice, the influence of
motivational factors on visitors’ learning is of paramount importance (Falk and Dierking 1992). Some evidence that personal goals or pre-visit agendas influence visitors’
behavior and learning in museums has been provided by Falk et al. (1998). The present
study extends this work, focusing on a range of motivational factors that impact on visitors’ experience of learning in educational leisure settings.

Figure 1. Relationship of motivational factors to learning outcomes.

Motivational factors include both the personal characteristics that visitors bring
with them to the visit, such as personal goals and capability beliefs, and the situational
characteristics that they find in the setting itself, such as opportunities for learning, and
aspects that arouse interest. According to motivation theories (Ford 1992; Maehr
1984) these factors are presumed to impact on the selective direction of behavior (the
choice of one action over others), energization of behavior (the amount of energy or
effort expended) and persistence of behavior (its maintenance over time). These behavioral patterns in turn lead to various desired outcomes such as achievement, personal
growth or life satisfaction. In the present study, indicators of motivation will focus on
the selective direction, energization and persistence of learning behaviors. Desired outcomes will be considered in terms of the visitors’ self-reported experience of learning
and satisfaction with their visit (Figure 1).
This paper reports results from a survey conducted at six educational leisure sites
in Queensland, Australia. The survey employed a questionnaire designed to measure a
range of motivational factors and learning indicators across the six sites. Results from
three of these sites—a museum, an art gallery and an aquarium—are presented here.
These three sites were selected for this analysis as they all endeavor to provide an educational experience for their visitors using exhibits that are interpreted predominantly
through signage. In each case, exhibits are housed in a purpose-built center, which visitors are free to encounter in a self-directed manner. The three sites not included in this
analysis are an open-area wildlife center, a guided tour of an historic site, and a guided
tour of a national park. Visits to these latter sites tended to be longer (up to 8 hours in
some cases) and less self-directed (being dependent on tour guides and show times).
Visitors’ responses at these sites are reported in Packer (2002).

METHOD

The educational leisure sites: museum, art gallery and aquarium—The museum and
art gallery are located close to the inner city, and the aquarium is located close to a seaside resort area. The museum contains a range of exhibits, in themed areas, covering

the natural environment and cultural heritage. The art gallery displays a permanent collection of Australian and international paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, photographs, decorative arts and crafts, as well as a wide range of visiting exhibitions. The
aquarium contains a range of live aquatic displays including sharks, whales, crocodiles,
stingrays, corals, fish, sea jellies and seals. There is a charge for admission to the aquarium, but not to the museum or art gallery.
The questionnaire—The questionnaire was designed around an integrative framework
of motivational factors, derived from a conceptual analysis of the literature. Further
information on measurement issues is provided in Packer (2002). The first half of the
questionnaire was completed before the visit, in the presence of the researcher, and
covered personal reasons for visiting, need for cognition (Cacioppo and Petty 1982), as
well as demographics such as age, gender, place of residence, previous visits, companions, and occupation. Participants then kept the questionnaire with them during their
visit, completed the second half at the end of the visit and returned it to a designated
place near the main exit. The second half focused on their perceptions of the learning
environment, their experience of learning during the visit, and their overall satisfaction.
Each section of the questionnaire took approximately 10 minutes to complete.
Participants and procedure—All independent adult visitors during a data-collection
period of two to three days at each site were invited to complete the questionnaire. Visitors in organized tour groups were not included in the study because they typically have
limited time at the site and their visits are often not self-directed. Adults accompanied
by young children were also excluded for similar reasons—the difficulty of taking time
to complete the questionnaire, and the likelihood that the nature of their learning experience would be determined by the child’s needs and interests rather than their own.
Although these sampling considerations limit the generalizability of the findings, they
contributed to maintaining the study’s focus on free-choice learning experiences.

Visitors were approached as they entered the site and invited to participate in the
study by completing a questionnaire. The approximate time commitment (10 minutes
before and 10 minutes after the visit) was explained, and those who were willing to participate were offered a small incentive (a free cup of tea or coffee) to encourage and
thank them for their time. Questionnaires were distributed at each site until at least 70
had been returned. Completed questionnaires were thus received from 81 museum visitors, 88 art gallery visitors and 81 aquarium visitors.
Participation rates varied markedly between sites (Table 1), museum visitors
being more willing to take, complete, and return a questionnaire than art gallery and
aquarium visitors.
The fact that a common response when refusing was, “I’m here to relax, I don’t
feel like thinking,” sheds some light on the reasons underlying this variation in participation rates and has major implications for this study. First, it suggests that visitors to
the different sites approach their visit with different levels of openness to cognitive
activity, a finding that is pertinent to the aims of the study (to investigate motivational
factors across the three sites) and is discussed in this context below. Second, it introduces a response bias, in that those who value and enjoy cognitive activity are likely to
be over-represented among the survey respondents. This possibility is further explored
in the discussion of the survey findings.
Although a quota sampling procedure was not strictly adhered to, checks were
made during the process of questionnaire distribution to ensure that adequate numbers
of males/females and different age groups were represented. Other personal characteristics, such as place of residence, previous visits and type of companions (with the
exclusions noted above) were allowed to vary naturally according to the visiting population on the days sampled. Seasonal variations are not reflected in these data. Visitor
characteristics at each site are presented in Table 2.
In summary, respondents at the museum tended to be younger, more often from
overseas, and more likely to be visiting for the first time than respondents at the other
sites. Art gallery respondents were more often locals who had made a number of previous visits, and aquarium respondents included a mix of locals and tourists, usually visiting with family or friends. Because sampling was not carried out on a purely random
basis (particularly in relation to seasonal and weekly variations), these differences can
not necessarily be considered representative of the visiting population in general, or
indeed of museums, art galleries and aquaria in other places. However, the findings
suggest that these three institutions appeal to different visitor groups, and this is supported by other data reported below.

RESULTS

Comparisons between the three sites were made in terms of four motivational factors:
• visitors’ reasons for visiting the site (personal goals);

• perceptions regarding the opportunities for learning available at the site (context
beliefs); and
• perceptions regarding the interest-arousing characteristics of the environment
(situational incentives).
Visitors’ self-reported learning experiences and their overall satisfaction with the
visit were also compared among the three sites.
Reasons for visiting—Visitors were given 40 possible reasons for visiting an educational leisure setting, expressed in terms of the desired outcome of the visit. These items
were derived from previous research in leisure motivation (Beard and Ragheb 1983;

Crandall 1980; Crompton 1979) and goal taxonomies (Ford and Nichols 1987) and
revised after pilot studies. Factor analysis was applied to group these items into five
subscales:
• Learning and discovery (the desire to discover new things, expand knowledge, be
better informed and experience something new or unusual);
• Passive enjoyment1 (the desire to enjoy oneself, to be pleasantly occupied and to
feel happy and satisfied);
• Restoration (the desire to relax mentally and physically, to have a change from
routine and recover from stress and tension);
• Social interaction (the desire to spend time with friends or family, interact with
others and build relationships); and
• Self-fulfillment (the desire to make things more meaningful, challenge abilities,
feel a sense of achievement and develop self-knowledge and self-worth).
Details of these items and subscales are provided in Packer (2002). Visitors’
mean scores on these five subscales are reported in Table 3.
Significant differences between sites were found on three subscales: learning and
discovery, restoration and social interaction. In particular, visitors to the aquarium
rated social interaction and restoration goals more highly, and learning and discovery
goals less highly than museum and art gallery visitors. As noted above, demographic
characteristics of visitors varied significantly between sites, and so may act as confounding variables in the analysis of reasons for visiting. For example, the aquarium had
more visitors who were accompanied by a friend or family member, and these visitors

would be more likely to have social goals for their visit; the aquarium and art gallery had
more local visitors and these were more likely to have restorative or social goals for
their visit. The above analyses were repeated with these variables (company and place
of residence) as covariates. Significant differences were still found on all three subscales although the effect of site on social interaction goals was considerably reduced
when company was entered as a covariate (effect size reduced from .09 to .03, F 2, 237
= 3.18, p < .05) and the effect of site on restorative goals was reduced when place of
residence was entered as a covariate (effect size reduced from .04 to .03, F 2, 229 =
3.24, p < .05).
Repeated measures ANOVA also indicated significant differences within sites.
As illustrated in Table 3, museum visitors placed greater importance on learning and
discovery goals than any of the other subscales. Art gallery visitors placed equal importance on learning/discovery and enjoyment goals, and these were both more important
than the other three subscales. Aquarium visitors placed greater importance on enjoyment than on the other subscales.
Thus although learning and discovery goals were important to respondents at all
three sites, they were especially important to museum visitors. Combined with the evidence regarding participation rates presented above, this suggests that museum visitors
come with a greater willingness to use their mind and to reflect than visitors to other
sites.

NEED FOR COGNITION

The need for cognition scale was developed by Cacioppo and Petty (1982) to measure
individual differences in the tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors. This scale has been thoroughly tested for reliability and validity and its use has
been reported extensively in the psychology literature (Cacioppo et al. 1996). Significant differences were found between the sites on this measure (Table 4), art gallery visitors having a higher need for cognition than either museum or aquarium visitors. Thus
art gallery visitors were more likely to have a personal disposition towards enjoying and

seeking out thinking and learning activities in general, even though they may not have
specifically sought such opportunities in their gallery visit.

PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

Significant differences between sites were found in relation to visitors’ perceptions of
the learning environment. The museum was more often seen as educational rather
than entertaining, the aquarium was more often seen as entertaining rather than educational, and art gallery visitors were evenly divided over whether it was more educational or entertaining (Table 5).
The items reported in Table 6 shed further light on these perceptions. Although
the museum was seen as a place where the presented information is important, it was
actually perceived as having fewer opportunities to learn than the aquarium and learning was perceived as being less fun than at the aquarium. On all of these items, the art
gallery was perceived to be less of a learning environment than the other sites.
Situational incentives for learning—Visitors were asked to rate each site in relation to
a number of items identified in the literature and in pilot research as being aspects that
were likely to arouse interest in learning. The museum was superior to other sites in
terms of information being presented in an interesting way; visitors having the opportunity to participate actively; and visitors being able to see the real things or places to
which the information referred (Table 7). However, visitors felt they had less opportunity to ask questions than at the other sites and the information had less emotional
appeal, although this was not statistically significant. Again the art gallery was perceived as having fewer incentives for learning than the other sites, with the exception of
the emotional appeal of its material.
The experience of learning—A number of items were used to ascertain the extent to
which visitors showed evidence of learning motivation during their visit, including selec191

tion of learning options (deliberately looking for opportunities to learn or think); persistence in learning (persisting with a topic until they understood it); and amount of
invested mental effort (cognitive engagement with the information presented). These
were combined into a composite score for motivated learning behavior, and museum
visitors reported the highest scores on this measure (Table 8).
Visitors were also asked to indicate the extent to which they had experienced
aspects of learning and discovery during their visit (mental stimulation, discovering new
things, learning and making sense of things). However, this measure did not vary significantly between the sites (Table 9).
Satisfaction with the visit—Visitors were asked five questions regarding their overall
feelings of satisfaction with their visit, and there were no significant differences between
sites on this measure (Table 10).
Relationships between motivational factors, the experience of learning and visitor satisfaction—At all sites, visitors who placed importance on learning and discovery goals
were more likely to display motivated learning behavior and to report having experienced learning and discovery during their visit (Table 11). Context beliefs and situa-

tional incentives were also related to motivated learning behavior and the experience of
learning at all sites. Capability beliefs (operationalized in this study as the need for cognition) were related to motivated learning behavior only at the museum.
Visitor satisfaction was directly related to the experience of learning and discovery at all three sites, and to engagement in motivated learning behaviour at the museum
and art gallery (Table 12). The finding that these relationships were much stronger in
the museum and art gallery than in the aquarium supports the suggestion that learning
is more important to these visitors. The relationships between motivational factors and
the experience of learning are discussed in more detail in Packer (2002).

DISCUSSION

The findings of this study reinforce the important place of learning in educational
leisure settings, especially in museums. Respondents at the museum and art gallery

rated learning and discovery goals as their most important reason for visiting, and in the
aquarium, this was second only to enjoyment goals. Respondents at all sites were keen
to discover new things, expand their knowledge and be better informed. This finding
needs to be interpreted with some care, however, because the response bias inherent in
the data collection procedures may have resulted in the survey data overestimating the
importance of learning to visitors (i.e., visitors who agreed to participate in the survey
were more open to engaging in cognitive activity than those who refused). Research
conducted at other educational leisure settings provides some mitigating evidence in
this regard. One of these sites was a guided tour of an historical site. Participation rates
at this site were much higher (73% of all visitors accepted a questionnaire) because visitors were able to complete the questionnaire during a 1.5 hour boat trip before and
after the tour. The findings from this site with regard to the importance placed by visitors on the learning aspects of the visit are comparable with the results reported here in
relation to the aquarium (e.g., mean importance of learning and discovery goals = 4.33,
compared with 4.21 at the aquarium [Table 3]) and thus run counter to the suggestion
that the figures for the aquarium are an overestimate.
In comparison with the other two sites, visitors perceived the museum as a place
where information which is important to them is presented in an interesting way. The
aquarium was perceived more as a place where learning is fun, and the art gallery was
perceived as a place where learning is emotionally engaging. Visitors to the museum
were more likely to engage in motivated learning behavior than visitors to the other two
sites. In the museum context, visitors who invested themselves in learning in this way
found the experience more satisfying overall.
Again, the effect of response bias can be discounted in relation to this finding. A
response bias favouring an overestimation of the importance of learning would be
expected to be greatest in the aquarium, where the participation rates were lowest, and
lowest in the museum where participation rates were relatively high. Thus to correct
for this effect would create even greater differences between the sites and provide even
greater support for the conclusion that museum visitors place more importance on the
experience of learning than visitors to other sites.
These findings highlight the important status of museums among educational
leisure settings. Museums attract visitors who are motivated to learn, perceive the
museum as a place where important information is presented in an interesting way, are
willing to devote effort to learning activities, and find such efforts satisfying. There is
thus great potential for museums to continue to expand and develop their role as
providers of informal education. The finding that art gallery visitors in this study had a
higher need for cognition than visitors to the other sites suggests that art gallery visitors
may also be receptive to further development of the thinking and learning aspects of
their visit.
These findings also present a challenge for museum educators as they raise the
question of how to attract visitors who are less motivated to learn. Hood (1983) reported that museum visitors differ significantly from non-visitors in terms of the value they
place on certain attributes and their perception that these attributes are present in

museums. The current study suggests that museum visitors differ in their perceptions
and expectations from both art gallery and aquarium visitors. On the one hand, they
are more likely to value the learning aspects of their visit. On the other hand, they are
less likely to see the learning environment as entertaining, fun or emotionally engaging.
These perceptions have implications for the way museum experiences are marketed.
The need for greater attention to theory in both museum learning (which encompasses learning in science museums, history museums and art galleries) and interpretation (which encompasses learning in recreational settings such as national parks, heritage sites and commercial tourist attractions) has been noted by scholars in both areas
(Ballantyne and Uzzell 1999; Kelly 2002; Schauble et al. 1997; Uzzell 1998). The
similarities and differences between sites that have been identified here suggest that the
study of motivational factors can make an important contribution to a theoretical foundation for interpretation that is relevant to both museum and commercial tourism contexts. The development of a common theoretical foundation is an important response
to Falk’s (2000, 6) call to “solidify the growing unity of all museum-like institutions”.
An understanding of the motivational factors involved in leisure or free-choice learning
across a range of settings will also help to meet the challenge inherent in all educational leisure settings—the need to stimulate visitors’ motivation to learn.

NOTE
1. This factor has been labeled “passive” enjoyment to distinguish it from the concept
of entertainment, which often includes ideas of discovery and exploration. For
example, the desire to see something new and interesting was considered an entertainment motive by Falk, Moussouri and Coulson (1998). In this study, such items
were found to load on the learning and discovery factor.
