Given that little is known about museum visitors' pro-environmental behavior, this research examines the
process of decision formation for environmentally responsible museums. The research employed the model of
goal-directed behavior, tested its applicability, and deepened it using problem awareness, aﬀective commitment,
and non-green alternative attractiveness. Data collected from a ﬁeld survey was used for analysis. Results of the
structural analysis indicated that variables within the theory were in general signiﬁcantly associated. Moreover,
desire acted as an important mediator and had the strongest inﬂuence on intention. Moreover, the proposed
model included a suﬃcient level of explanatory power for visitors’ pro-environmental intention. Testing for
structural metric invariance revealed that the role of desire in determining intention was maximized when the
level of aﬀective commitment was high and when perceived non-green alternative attractiveness was low. The
ﬁndings provide a suﬃcient understanding of visitors’ decision-making process for visiting an environmentally
responsible museum.

1. Introduction
Given the seriousness of the environmental crisis the world is facing,
museums are increasingly responding to the issue in a positive way by
incorporating sustainability into their building, facilities, operations,
designs, programming, and exhibitions (Brophy & Wylie, 2006, 2008;
Wylie & Brophy, 2008). In the museum industry, such institutions are
described as environmentally responsible museums (Brophy & Wylie,
2006; Wylie & Brophy, 2008). Although many conventional museums
are still not active in practicing eco-friendly management (Sutter,
2006), green museums have recently become an important trend in the
industry (Brophy & Wylie, 2006, 2008; Wylie & Brophy, 2008).
Increasing the number of visitors is an important task for every
museum operator (Carey, Davidson, & Sahli, 2013). A clear understanding of visitor post-purchase decision-making process can contribute to enhancing the number of visitors. While it is not a simple task
to elucidate an individual's intricate decision-making process, researchers in diverse ﬁelds have claimed that discovering key factors
leading to intention to engage in a particular action oﬀers an important
clue to understanding his/her decision-making process (Ajzen, 1991;
Ferns & Walls, 2012; Hsu & Huang, 2012; Hwang & Hyun, 2017;
Jalilvand, Samiei, Dini, & Manzari, 2012; Lee, Bonn, & Cho, 2015;

Lyu & Hwang, 2017; Song, Lee, & Norman, 2012). In this regard, researchers have paid considerable attention to volitional and non-volitional driving forces in decision/intention (Ajzen, 1991;
Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Lee et al., 2015).
Previous studies and conceptualizations regarding the prediction of
intention by focusing solely on volitional and non-volitional processes,
however, are believed to be not suﬃcient in wholly explicating individuals’ decision-making processes, particularly in a leisure, hospitality and tourism sector (Han & Yoon, 2015; Song, Lee, Kang et al.,
2012; Wen, 2009). A model of goal-directed behavior
(Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001) was speciﬁcally designed to clarify the individual's decision formation in a more broad and eﬀective manner.
This model theorizes that one's intention for a particular action forms
through volitional, non-volitional, emotional, experiential, and motivational processes (Bagozzi & Dholakia, 2006; Perugini & Bagozzi,
2001, 2004). Within the framework of this goal-directed behavior
theory, volitional, non-volitional, emotional, and experiential dimensions directly trigger motivation; and these dimensions work through
the motivational variable in determining intention (Carrus,
Passafaro, & Bonnes,
2008;
Perugini & Bagozzi,
2001;
Song,
Lee, & Norman, 2012).
Due to the theory's robustness, it has been widely utilized in a

H. Han et al.

2012a; Taylor, Ishida, & Wallace, 2009). In the model of goal-directed
behavior, the role of variables and relationships among them involving
constructs rooted in the planned behavior theory and incorporated
constructs were redeﬁned (Lee et al., 2012; Song, Lee, Norman, & Han,
2012b). The model of goad-directed behavior was developed based on
the strong assumption that one's particular behavior is directly and
largely anticipated by his/her desire to engage in the behavior
(Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001). Perugini and Bagozzi (2001) deﬁned such
desire toward the behavior as 'the motivational state of mind wherein
appraisals and reasons to act are transformed into a motivation to do so'
(p. 84).
According to the theory, in combination, attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, positive and
negative anticipated emotions, and past behavior give rise to human
desire, leading to the formation of behavioral intention
(Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001, 2004). In other words, as a general rule, the
more favorable or greater the attitude, anticipated emotion, subjective
norm, perceived behavioral control, and frequency of past behavior, the
stronger should be the individual's desire and intention, which is the
immediate antecedent of behavior (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001, 2004;
Song et al., 2012a; Taylor et al., 2009). Attitude toward behavior refers
to 'a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular
entity with some degree of favor or disfavor' (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993, p.
1). While subjective norm indicates 'the perception of social pressure
related to the action' (Han & Hwang, 2014, p. 1120), perceived behavioral control is deﬁned as 'the assessed ease or diﬃculty of conducting
the action' (Han & Hwang, 2014, p. 1120). In addition, frequency of
past behavior indicates habit strength (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001); anticipated emotions refer to one's expected post-behavioral aﬀective responses, which can be either positive or negative (Perugini & Bagozzi,
2001). Under the model of goal-directed behavior, human decisionformation can be more eﬃciently and comprehensively explained due
to the theory's scope, which covers not only volitional and non-volitional processes but also emotional, motivational, and automatic processes (Carrus et al., 2008; Song et al., 2012a; Taylor et al., 2009).

variety of sectors including hospitality and tourism (e.g., Dijst,
Farag, & Schwanen, 2008; Han & Hwang, 2014; Han & Yoon, 2015; Lee,
Song, Bendle, Kim, & Han, 2012; Song, Lee, Kang, & Boo, 2012).
Nevertheless, no research has employed this goal-directed behavior
framework to clearly comprehend museum visitors’ pro-environmental
decision-making process. Moreover, a recent line of studies in environmental behavior indicates that problem awareness (Chan, Hon,
Chan, & Okumus, 2014; De Groot & Steg, 2009), aﬀective commitment
(Lee, Chua, & Han, 2016; Mattila, 2001), and non-green alternative
attractiveness
(Bansal, Taylor, & James,
2005; Han, 2015;
Hwang & Hyun, 2014) are critical inﬂuences on reasoning regarding
environmentally responsible choice among diverse options. Despite its
signiﬁcance, little eﬀort has been made to investigate the role of problem awareness, aﬀective commitment, and non-green alternative attractiveness in generating visitors’ intention to visit an environmentally
responsible museum.
Given this research needs, the present study was designed to (1)
examine visitors’ decision formation for visiting an environmentally
responsible museum by employing the model of goal-directed behavior,
(2) deepen this theory by considering the moderating impact of problem awareness, aﬀective commitment, and non-green alternatives’
attractiveness, and (3) identify the mediating impact of desire toward
the behavior in the relationship between its antecedents and visit intention.
2. Literature review
2.1. Environmentally responsible museums
According to Byers (2008), environmentally responsible museums
are 'organizations engaged in green business practices, eco-friendly
facility management, and sustainable educational programming' (p.
14). Diverse sustainable practices and eﬀorts are integrated and implemented into environmentally responsible museum operations (e.g.
energy eﬃciency, eﬀective HVAC [Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning] systems, recycling, eﬃcient waste streams, reduced resource
use, reuse of materials, healthy green foodservice in the café, green gift
shop, energy eﬃcient appliances, green architecture and technology,
energy-eﬃcient lighting, natural lighting, water-eﬃcient restroom ﬁxtures, environmentally responsible oﬃce supplies, green cleaning products, natural landscaping, green roofs/walls, encouragement of green
transportation, green education, green exhibits) (Brophy & Wylie, 2008;
Byers, 2008; Worts, 2004, 2006; Wylie & Brophy, 2008). In addition,
unlike conventional museums, environmentally responsible museums
promote sustainable choices/decision-makings to both their visitors
and employees, and motivate visitors and employees to actively practice green activities at the museums and at their homes (Byers, 2008).
Children's museums and zoological organizations are believed to be
among the ﬁrst to initiate green practices (Brophy & Wylie, 2008).
Children's museums took an active role in lessening harmful environmental impacts on young visitors by creating healthy indoor environments, while zoological organizations adopted green and healthy design principles for the preservation of wildlife and their habitats (Byers,
2008).

2.3. Relationships among variables in the model of goal-directed behavior
In diverse contexts, it has been repeatedly identiﬁed that one's desire toward the behavior is a signiﬁcant direct driving force of his/her
behavioral intention; furthermore, attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, anticipated emotions, and
past behavior provide the direct impetus for such desire (Carrus et al.,
2008; Han & Hwang, 2015; Lee et al., 2012; Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001;
Taylor et al., 2009). In particular, in a tourism context, Lee et al. (2012)
found that volitional, non-volitional, emotional, and experiential/habit
factors are in general highly associated with desire toward the behavior, and such relationships signiﬁcantly aﬀect one's intention to travel
internationally during a pandemic. Consistent with that, Carrus et al.
(2008) also demonstrated the signiﬁcance of such variables in a decision-formation framework. Their proposed goal-directed behavior
model was empirically tested in both public transportation and recycling settings, and the high anticipation power of the model for one's
intention was veriﬁed in both contexts. Results of several studies
showed the insigniﬁcant inﬂuence of subjective norm or perceived
behavioral control (e.g. Song et al., 2012a, 2012b). For instance, in the
casino context, Song et al. (2012b) found the desire was not a signiﬁcant function of subjective norm and perceived behavioral control.
However, the insigniﬁcant direct associations in these studies were was
mostly due to the high between-construct correlations. Overall, according to the works discussed above, volitional, non-volitional, emotional, and experiential elements within the theory work through desire
in building intention. In addition, direct associations between desire
and such proximal factors are evident (Han & Hwang, 2015;
Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001, 2004; Taylor et al., 2009). Accordingly, the
following hypotheses are proposed:

2.2. Model of goal-directed behavior
Perugini and Bagozzi (2001) developed the model of goal-directed
behavior to improve the suﬃciency of existing socio-psychological
theories (e.g. theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behavior)
and better explicate human behavior. Such elements as aﬀective/
emotional, motivational, and experiential/habit elements are imperative to the human decision-making process but are overlooked in
the theory of planned behavior were considered to be important driving
forces of one's decision/action in this goal-directed behavior theory
(Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001, 2004; Poels & Dewitte, 2008; Song et al.,

commitment, has long been an interest for many researchers in organizational behavior, marketing, and consumer behavior. According to
Meyer and Allen (1991), commitment is in brief one's psychological
state that ties him/her to the organization. As an emotional aspect of
commitment, they described aﬀective commitment as an individual's
emotional attachment to his/her organization. Consistently and thoroughly, Verhoef, Franses, and Hoekstra (2002) deﬁned this aﬀective
commitment as 'the psychological attachment of an exchange partner to
the other and is based on feelings of identiﬁcation, loyalty, and afﬁliation' (p. 204). This concept is regarded to be particularly important
for strong relationship building between consumers and service/product providers (Lee et al., 2016; Morgan & Hunt, 1994).
Numerous researchers have pointed out that aﬀective commitment
is a powerful construct inﬂuencing customers’ decision-making process
and post-purchase behaviors (Evanschitzky, Brock & Blut, 2011;
Hwang, Han & Choo, 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Mattila, 2001). According
to Mattila (2001), patrons who feel high aﬀective commitment to a
particular restaurant are likely to show stronger emotional bonding
with memorable previous restaurant experiences and personal recognition. Liu and Mattila (2015) asserted that when patrons have a
strong level of commitment, they often build a strong intention to
continue the positive relationship with the service provider and show a
strong desire to help the company improve its business by making
constructive suggestions. This conative factor is an essential constituent
of clearly explicating consumers’ decision formation and purchase behavior (Oliver, 1997). Evanschitzky et al. (2011) indicated that although repeated service failures occur, consumers are likely to be tolerant if they have a high aﬀective commitment to the ﬁrm. According to
them, such consumers with strong aﬀective commitment tend to center
on the whole relationship with the provider rather than a speciﬁc
transaction. Consistently, in examining cruise passengers’ loyaltyintention-generation process, Lee et al. (2016) empirically identiﬁed
that the magnitude of the relationships between cruise passengers’ intention and its drivers (e.g. satisfaction, novelty, product performances)
are signiﬁcantly moderated by the level of aﬀective commitment. In
their research, such relationships were stronger in the high aﬀective
commitment group than in the low aﬀective commitment group. Based
on these evidences discussed above, we posited that aﬀective commitment signiﬁcantly moderates the visitors’ intention and desire relationship in an environmentally responsible museum context. The
tenth hypothesis is thus:

H2. Subjective norm is signiﬁcantly related to desire toward the
behavior.
H3. Perceived behavioral control is signiﬁcantly related to desire
toward the behavior.
H4. Positive anticipated emotion is signiﬁcantly related to desire
toward the behavior.
H5. Negative anticipated emotion is signiﬁcantly related to desire
toward the behavior.
H6. Frequency of past behavior is signiﬁcantly related to desire toward
the behavior.
H7. Frequency of past behavior is signiﬁcantly related to visit intention.
H8. Desire toward the behavior is signiﬁcantly related to visit intention.
2.4. Impact of problem awareness
Given the growing eco-conscious market environment, researchers
have increasingly stressed the need to unearth factors that inﬂuence
patrons’ pro-environmental decision-making process. One of such key
factors is problem awareness (Chan et al., 2014; Han, 2015;
Han & Hwang, 2015). Problem awareness indicates 'knowing of the
impact of human behavior on the environment' (Kollmuss & Agyeman,
2002, p. 253). Consistently, De Groot and Steg (2009) deﬁned problem
awareness as whether an individual is aware of the harmful consequences for other people or for other things (e.g. animals, plants,
habitats) one highly values when not behaving pro-socially/pro-environmentally. That is, this concept is about individuals’ consciousness
level regarding negative consequences for valued objects/things derived from socially/environmentally unfriendly behaviors (Schwartz,
1977). Such terms as problem awareness, environmental awareness,
adverse consequences of the valued objects, and awareness of adverse
consequences are all used in an interchangeable manner in the existing
literature (Han, 2015).
The signiﬁcant inﬂuence of problem awareness on individuals’ decision-making process has been broadly investigated in many sectors.
According to Chan et al. (2014), individuals with high awareness of
environmental problems often engage in environmentally responsible
behaviors (e.g. consuming eco-labeled products, recycling). Chan and
Hawkins (2010) identiﬁed that employees’ ecologically responsible
behaviors are often derived from the increased environmental awareness of consequences and their understanding of environmental management system. Moreover, many researchers in environmental behavior asserted that one's problem awareness moderates the relationship
(s) between his/her pro-environmental intention/behavior and its
predictor(s) (De Groot & Steg, 2009; Steg & De Groot, 2010;
Vining & Ebreo, 1992). Consistent with this assertion, Han and Hwang
(2015) in a convention context empirically demonstrated that international convention travelers’ loyalty intention and its antecedents
(moral obligation and commitment) are signiﬁcantly associated, and
such relationships are under the signiﬁcant impact of problem awareness. Based on the above discussion, we proposed that problem
awareness signiﬁcantly moderate the linkage from visitors’ visit intention and desire association in an environmentally responsible museum
sector. An additional hypothesis is thus:

H10. The relationship between desire toward the behavior and visit
intention is signiﬁcantly moderated by aﬀective commitment.
2.6. Impact of alternative attractiveness
Because of the importance of retaining customers, researchers in
various ﬁelds have explored many factors that are critical in customer
retention process. Alternative attractiveness is often regarded to be one
of the major factors inﬂuencing such process (Bansal et al., 2005; Han,
2015; Hwang & Hyun, 2014). Customers often terminate a current relationship with their product/service provider and switch to a new
provider when they feel that the alternative product/service oﬀered by
the new provider is more attractive (Sharma & Patterson, 2000). However, when customers feel a lack of alternative attractiveness, it is more
likely that they remain with the existing relationship (Bansal et al.,
2005; Han, 2015). A lack of viable alternative attractiveness hence
often results in a higher customer retention rate (Han, 2015; Jones,
Mothersbaugh, & Beatty, 2000). The term, alternative attractiveness,
indicates 'individuals’ perceived level of attraction derived from the
image, reputation, and quality of the replacing product/service, which
is anticipated to be superior or more pertinent than that of the existing
one' (Han, Meng, & Kim, 2016, p. 6).
Many studies in a variety of contexts have examined the vital role of
alternative attractiveness in explaining individuals’ decision formation

H9. The relationship between desire toward the behavior and visit
intention is signiﬁcantly moderated by problem awareness.
2.5. Impact of aﬀective commitment
Due to its criticality in decision formation, the term, aﬀective

and behavior (Goode and Harris, 2007; Han et al., 2016; Kim, Park, and
Jeong, 2004; Nagengast, Evanschitzky, Blut, & Rudolph, 2014).
Nagengast et al. (2014) demonstrated that the associations between
patrons’ post-purchase intention and its drivers are under the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of alternative attractiveness. Kim et al. (2004) identiﬁed that customers with a high perception of alternatives attractiveness are less likely to perceive well-being emotions in that these
customers are more likely to believe that the alternatives are suitable
than the current product/service. In addition, if customers who feel a
high alterative attractiveness perceive the relative merit that an alternative oﬀers, they are likely to perceive that the price of the existing
product/service is somewhat unfair (Goode & Harris, 2007). In a sustainable leisure sector, some non-green alternatives (golf, skiing, conventional hotels, oﬀ-road driving, ﬁshing, etc) may steer travelers away
from environmentally responsible behaviors. Indeed, in an eco-friendly
leisure context, Han et al. (2016) empirically identiﬁed that travelers’
pro-environmental intention and its antecedents are signiﬁcantly
moderated by the attractiveness of unsustainable alternatives. In their
research, a social psychology theory was utilized and deepened by alternative attractiveness. Based on the above discussion, we expected
that non-green alternative attractiveness signiﬁcantly moderate the
degree of the impact of desire toward the behavior on visitors’ ecofriendly intention for environmentally responsible museums. The ﬁnal
research hypothesis is thus:

3.1. Measurement items and questionnaire
Established instruments were utilized to evaluate all variables examined in the survey (see Appendix). Responses to every instrument
were on a seven point scale. In particular, attitude toward the behavior
was assessed on a ﬁve item scale developed by Ajzen (1991) and Ajzen
and Fishbein (1980). Subjective norm and perceived behavioral control
were measured on a three item scale, respectively, developed by Ajzen
(1991). Positive and negative anticipated emotions were evaluated
using four-item scale and ﬁve-item scale, respectively. These scales
were adopted from Perugini and Bagozzi (2001) and Han (2015). Frequency of past behavior was assessed by a two-item scale adopted from
Perugini and Bagozzi (2001).
Desire toward the behavior was measured by a three item scale
developed by Perugini and Bagozzi (2001). Problem awareness was
evaluated with three items employed from Bamberg and Schmidt
(2003). Aﬀective commitment was measured by a three-item scale
borrowed from Lee et al. (2016) and Mattila (2006). Non-green alternative attractiveness was assessed with two items adopted from Jones
et al. (2000) and Han (2015). Lastly, visit intention was measured by a
three item scale employed from Ajzen (1991). Our survey questionnaire
comprising these instruments, description of environmentally responsible museums, and questions for personal characteristics were
thoroughly reviewed and improved by industry and academic experts.
In addition, the questionnaire was further reﬁned based on the results
of a pretest with graduate students and faculty members whose major is
leisure/hospitality/tourism and whose museum visit frequency is high.

H11. The relationship between desire toward the behavior and visit
intention is signiﬁcantly moderated by non-green alternative
attractiveness.

2.7. Proposed model and research hypotheses
3.2. Data collection and sample characteristics
The proposed conceptual model of this study is displayed in Fig. 1.
The theoretical framework of the present study is composed of the
original variables within the model of goal-directed behavior (i.e. attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral
control, positive and negative anticipated emotions, frequency of past
behavior, desire toward the behavior, and behavioral intention) and
problem awareness, aﬀective commitment, and non-green alternative
attractiveness as moderators in order to explicate visitors’ decisionmaking process for visiting an environmentally responsible museum
visitation. The model contains a total of 11 research hypotheses.

We conducted a ﬁled survey at eight museums located in a metropolitan city of South Korea. Although these museums are not entirely
green, they are generally known to practice green principles and environmentally responsible management, strictly following government
environmental rules and regulations. Well-trained students collected
the data at these major museums. Museum visitors’ willingness to take
part in the survey was asked in restaurants, cafés, or rest areas within
the museums. Once the visitors agreed to survey participation, detailed
information about the research and an instruction regarding how to

complete the questionnaire were provided. Moreover, all participants
were asked to read the description of environmentally responsible
museums carefully. All respondents returned the completed survey
questionnaire onsite, contributing to a higher response rate. The
average time for the survey completion was about 10 min. Of about 600
distributed questionnaires, a total of 429 usable cases were obtained,
after excluding some extreme and unusable cases. The data analysis was
conducted using these responses.
Slightly over 54.9% of the samples were female visitors whereas
44.8% of them were male visitors. Mean age of the respondents was an
average of about 30.5 years old. In terms of the participants’ education
level, university graduates were majority (66.7%), followed by graduate degree holders (14.1%), high school graduates (or less) (10.8%),
and two-year college/some college graduates (8.5%). The respondents’
annual income level was queried. The annual income between US
$40,000 and US$84,999 was reported by the largest number (44.3%),
followed by income under US$39,999 (37.0%) and income over US
$85,000 (18.6%). All participants’ museum visits for the past one year
was an average of about 2.2 times. Their average visits for the past
three years was approximately 6.5 times.

4. Results
4.1. Measurement model assessment
A conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in order to
generate a measurement model. Results of the CFA revealed an excellent ﬁt to the data (χ2 = 1292.789, df = 539, χ2/df = 2.398,
p < .001, RMSEA = .057, CFI = .938, IFI = .939, TLI = .928). All
observed variables were signiﬁcantly loaded to their related latent
constructs (p < .01). The details about the CFA results are reported in
Table 1. Internal consistency of the items for each construct was assessed. Our composite reliability calculation revealed that the values for
every construct, which range from .858 to .944, exceeded the suggested
threshold of .60. These results supported the internal validity of the
multiple-item measures (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). Subsequently, average variance calculated (AVE) values were calculated for
the assessment of construct validity. As shown in Table 1, our calculation reported that all values for study variables, which range from
.646 to .893, were greater than .05. In addition, these calculated values
were superior to the correlations (squared) between constructs. These
results supported convergent validity and discriminant validity.

variance in visit intention (R2 = .531). In addition, a total of 63.5% of
the variance in desire toward the behavior was accounted for by its
antecedents. The details about the SEM results are reported in Table 2
and Fig. 2.
The hypothesized relationships were tested. First, the proposed
impact of attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived
behavioral control, and positive and negative anticipated emotions on
desire toward the behavior was tested. Results of the SEM indicated that
attitude toward the behavior (β = .296, p < .01), subjective norm (β =
.167, p < .01), perceived behavioral control (β = .366, p < .01), and
positive (β = .106, p < .05) and negative (β = .097, p < .05) anticipated emotions exerted a signiﬁcant impact on desire toward the behavior. These ﬁndings supported Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The
hypothesized impact of frequency of past behavior was evaluated. The
SEM results indicated that frequency of past behavior signiﬁcantly and
positively aﬀected desire toward the behavior (β = .090, p < .05). Yet,
its impact on visit intention was not signiﬁcant (β = .059, p > .01).
Thus, while Hypothesis 6 was supported, Hypothesis 7 was not supported. The relationship between desire and intention was examined.
Our results indicated that visit intention was a signiﬁcant function of
desire toward the behavior (β = .714, p < .01). Therefore, Hypothesis
8 was supported.
The indirect inﬂuence of research constructs was investigated.
Findings from the structural model assessment revealed that attitude
toward behavior (β ATB→DTB→VI = .211, p < .01), subjective norm (β
= .119, p < .01), perceived behavioral control
SN→DTB→VI
(β PBC→DTB→VI = .261, p < .261), positive anticipated emotion (β
PAE→DTB→VI = .076, p < .5), and frequency of past behavior
(β FPB→DTB→VI = .064, p < .5) signiﬁcantly aﬀected visit intention indirectly through desire. That is, desire signiﬁcantly mediated its antecedents on intention. Subsequently, the total impact of research variables was assessed. As shown in Table 2, the total impact of desire on

intention was greatest among variables, followed by perceived behavioral control, attitude, frequency of past behavior, subjective norm,
and positive anticipated emotion.
4.3. Invariance model assessment for problem awareness
Prior to assessing a structural invariance test, a grouping was conducted. All survey responses were divided into the high (n = 289) and
low (n = 140) problem awareness groups. K-means cluster analysis was
utilized during this grouping process. A structural invariance model
(baseline model) was generated. Results of this baseline model assessment showed a satisfactory model ﬁt to the data (χ2 = 1444.570, df =
674, p < .001, χ2/df = 2.143, RMSEA = .052, CFI = .921, IFI = .921,
TLI = .911). This baseline model was compared to a nested model in
which a desire – visit intention link is restricted to be equivalent.
Results of the chi-square test revealed the insigniﬁcant diﬀerence on
this path across high and low groups (Δχ2 [1] = .45, p > .05).
Therefore, Hypothesis 9 was not supported. Details about this invariance test are shown in the Table 3 and Fig. 2 (Table 4, 5).
4.4. Invariance model assessment for aﬀective commitment
The moderating impact of aﬀective commitment was tested. A
grouping was done by using a K-means cluster analysis. All responses
were split into the high (n = 321) and low (n = 108) aﬀective commitment groups. A baseline model was created where all factor loadings
were restricted to be equal between two groups. Results indicated the
adequate ﬁt of the baseline model to the data (χ2 = 1485.423, df =
674, p < .001, χ2/df = 2.204, RMSEA = .053, CFI = .921, IFI = .913,
TLI = .901). As reported in Table 3, when comparing this model to a
nested model where the link from desire to intention is constrained to
be invariant, there was signiﬁcant chi-square diﬀerence between high

to visit an environmentally responsible museum; and our research objectives were wholly achieved.
Regarding the comparative importance of research variables, the
ﬁndings revealed that desire toward the behavior, which is a motivational process (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001, 2004), has the strongest total
impact on visit intention (β = .714, p < .01). That is, the results demonstrated that the contribution of a motivational process comprising
desire to increasing museum visitors’ pro-environmental intention is
greater than that of volitional (attitude and subjective norm), non-volitional (perceived behavioral control), emotional (positive and negative anticipated emotions), and experiential (past behavior) processes
within the proposed theoretical framework. From museum practitioners’ perspective, reﬂecting on these empirical ﬁndings, the allocation of resources should be centered on increasing visitors’ desire. The
ﬁndings further indicated that desire is mostly inﬂuenced by attitude
toward the behavior and perceived behavioral control. For the enhancement of visitors’ desire, eﬃciently dealing with attitude and
perceived behavioral control is compulsory. Improving excellent overall
museum experiences through boosting the performances of diverse
environmentally responsible museum attributes and being more easily
approachable to visitors would be the eﬀectual ways to help visitors
positively value visiting the museum and increase perceived ease of
visiting it.
While its direct impact on desire toward the behavior was signiﬁcant, the total inﬂuence of negative anticipated emotion on museum
visitors’ intention within our research framework appeared to be insigniﬁcant. Previous studies in diverse sectors indicated that this insigniﬁcant total impact of negative anticipated aﬀective reaction on
intention is not infrequent (e.g. Carrus et al., 2008; Han & Hwang,
2014; Lee et al., 2012; Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001). These researchers
asserted that if an individual's goal for a particular behavior is somewhat easily attainable without huge diﬃculty (e.g. visiting a museum),
his/her decision is not necessarily related to the negative facet of aﬀect.
In line with this indication, museum visitors’ negative anticipated
emotion, in the current study, was demonstrated to include a weaker
capacity of eliciting their behavioral intention.
Despite the critical role of frequency of past behavior in forming
behavioral intention, its direct eﬀect on intention was identiﬁed to be

4.5. Invariance model assessment for non-green alternative attractiveness
The hypothesized impact of non-green alternative attractiveness
was assessed. All survey responses were divided into high (n = 175)
and low (n = 254) groups of non-green alternative attractiveness by
employing a K-means cluster analysis. A baseline model was generated.
Results of the baseline model assessment revealed a satisfactory ﬁt to
the data (χ2 = 1583.756, df = 674, p < .001, χ2/df = 2.350, RMSEA
= .056, CFI = .907, IFI = .908, TLI = .896). As indicated in Table 3, a
comparison between this baseline model and a nested model where the
desire – intention relationship is restricted to be invariant was conducted. Our ﬁnding indicated a signiﬁcant chi-square diﬀerence across
high and low non-green alternative attractiveness groups (Δχ2 [1] =
4.147, p < .05). Therefore, Hypothesis 11 was supported.
5. Discussion
Focusing on the museum industry, the present research investigated
the formation of visitors’ pro-environmental intention by considering
the moderating inﬂuence of problem awareness, aﬀective commitment,
and non-green alternative attractiveness. This research utilized the
model of goal-directed behavior as a theoretical base for the comprehension of museum visitors’ decision-making process and deepened it
by combining such moderator variables into the proposed conceptual
framework. Results of the SEM revealed that the formation of visitors’
environmentally responsible intention is signiﬁcantly triggered by desire toward the behavior, perceived behavioral control, attitude toward
the behavior, frequency of past behavior, subjective norm, and positive
anticipated emotion. It also appeared that desire had a signiﬁcant
mediating role. Further analysis using a structural invariance test revealed that the impact of desire toward the behavior on intention was
greater for the high aﬀective commitment group than that of low group,
and the desire – intention linkage was stronger for the low non-green
alternative attractiveness group. Overall, research constructs within the
theoretical model suﬃciently accounted for museum visitors’ intention

competitive.
Although the desire–intention relationship was positive and signiﬁcant both in the high and low problem-awareness groups (high
group: β Desire – Intention = .716, p < .01 vs. low group: β Desire – Intention
= .689, p < .01), these groups did not show the signiﬁcant statistical
diﬀerence (p > .05). This result is not congruent with Schultz and
Zelezny (1998) and Vining and Ebreo (1992), but in line with De Groot
and Steg (2009) and Steg and De Groot (2010) who asserted the ineﬀectiveness of problem awareness as a moderator. Given this, museum
researchers should cautiously utilize this variable when developing a
theoretical framework for visitors’ environmentally responsible decision or behavior. Speciﬁcally, recognizing the insigniﬁcance of its
moderating role, problem awareness should be used as an independent
variable inﬂuencing such pro-environmental decisions or behaviors
rather than a moderator.
According to the goal directed behavior theory, desire toward the
behavior exerts a positive inﬂuence on intention and mediates the impact of its predictors on such intention (Bagozzi & Dholakia, 2006;
Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001; Poels & Dewitte, 2008). Such a mediating
framework is coherent with the results of the present study, which
empirically identiﬁed desire toward the behavior as a mediator bridging the attitude–intention link, the subjective norm–intention linkage,
the perceived behavioral control–intention relationship, the positive
anticipated emotion–intention link, and the frequency of past behavior–intention linkage. From a practical aspect, our results oﬀer museum operators meaningful information: boosting visitors’ level of desire is an essential requisite in order to maximize the inﬂuence of their
attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, positive anticipated emotion, and past behavior on visit intention. Oﬀering a
variety of health-related beneﬁts to visitors during their visit (e.g. fresh
air, green foods in cafés and restaurants within the museum, chemical
free health physical environment, natural lighting, air cleaners with
carbon ﬁlters, live potted plants) and marketing these healthy advantages to them will contribute to boosting their level of desire.
Theoretically, recognizing the mediating nature of desire toward the
behavior in an environmentally responsible museum sector, researchers
should actively use this mediator variable when developing a research
model and broadening an existing theory explaining visitors’ pro-environmental decision-making process.
As with most empirical studies, the current research is not free from
limitations. First, as the results of the measurement model assessment
revealed, a satisfactory level of reliability and validity of the measures
was achieved. Nonetheless, several variables were somewhat highly
correlated (e.g. the relationships between desire and aﬀective commitment and between desire and visit intention). Although such correlations did not exceed the problematic level, the high correlation can
aﬀect the entire framework, inﬂuencing calculations concerning individual predictors and causing imprecise results. A careful research
design considering the reduction of high correlation is suggested for
future study. Second, a theory deepening eﬀort by considering a moderating eﬀect of research variables was made in this study. Ajzen (1991)
asserted that theory broadening is important as much as theory

insigniﬁcant in a current research setting, which was not congruent
with Hypothesis 7. This result is similar to the ﬁndings of some previous
studies that identiﬁed the insigniﬁcant direct role of past behavior (e.g.
Song et al., 2012a; Song et al., 2012b). Nevertheless, this insigniﬁcant
relationship does not mean that museum visitors’ frequency of past
behavior is irrelevant to their behavioral intention as the total impact of
the frequency of past behavior on intention was signiﬁcant. That is,
such unexpected insigniﬁcant impact was due to the complete mediating role of desire, which is consistent with Song et al. (2012a) in the
leisure context and Song et al. (2012b) in the casino sector. Indeed, an
indirect impact of the frequency of past behavior on intention was
signiﬁcant. Given this, our results regarding such insigniﬁcant association need to be cautiously interpreted.
Some previous studies proposed and tested the moderating impact
of a certain variable(s) on one's decision-making process focus on intention and its proximal variable (e.g. Aydin, Ozer, & Arasil, 2005;
Han & Hwang, 2014; Jones et al., 2000), and generally identiﬁed a
signiﬁcant role of such moderator(s). Consistently, according to the
results of the structural invariance test, the impact of desire toward the
behavior on visit intention was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent across high and
low aﬀective commitment groups and high and low alterative attractiveness groups. Speciﬁcally, the magnitude of the eﬀect of desire toward the behavior on behavioral intention was greater in the high affective commitment group than in the low group (high group: β Desire –
Intention = .692, p < .01 vs. low group: β Desire – Intention = .592,
p < .01), and the degree of the impact of desire on intention was
greater in the low group for non-green alternative attractiveness than in
the high group (high group: β Desire – Intention = .680, p < .01 vs. low
group: β Desire – Intention = .726, p < .01).
Theoretically, this empirical ﬁnding helps museum researchers efﬁciently dig out and expand other existing conceptual frameworks associated with visitors’ decision-making process. From a practical point
of view, the identiﬁed moderating inﬂuence of aﬀective commitment
informs that increasing visitors’ attachment level to the environmentally responsible museum is vital to strengthen the impact of
visitors’ motivational process on positive intention generation for environmentally responsible museum establishments. In addition, the
empirically identiﬁed moderating impact of conventional alternative
attractiveness in the present study informs that boosting the level of
quality of environmentally responsible museum and the level of its
attribute performances to be comparable or even superior to those of
conventional properties is essential to reducing the attractiveness of
alternatives. Oﬀering more satisfactory overall museum experiences to
visitors will lead an enhanced aﬀective commitment that eventually
reinforces the role of desire in inducing their positive decision.
Moreover, providing beneﬁts rarely available in conventional museums
(e.g. green exhibits, healthy museum environment, learning opportunity of sustainable activities that can be implemented at home) will
increase visitor perception that environmentally responsible museums
are more attractive than conventional alternatives. Overall, making
such endeavors based on crucial information explored in the present
research will help environmentally responsible museums to be more

responsible museums. Moreover, to the author's knowledge, this research is the ﬁrst to integrate such key moderators as problem awareness, aﬀective commitment, and non-green alternative attractiveness,
which are vital in environmental behavior, into the model of goal-directed behavior in the museum industry. Building on the extant literature in museum visitors’ behavior, this research contributes to enriching both researchers’ and industry practitioners’ understanding of
visitors’ pro-environmental decision formation for environmentally responsible museums.

deepening. Consistently, Perugini and Bagozzi (2001) and Han and
Yoon (2015) insisted that any social psychology theory can be broadened/extended by including variables that are essential in a speciﬁc
sector. In future research, further important concepts in the museum
context (e.g., involvement, knowledge value, ﬂow, atmospherics) need
to be found and incorporated into our theoretical framework for the
enhancement of its completeness and prediction power.
6. Conclusion
This research was one of the limited studies that empirically uncovered the speciﬁc role of volitional, non-volitional, emotional, and
experiential processes within the goal-directed behavior framework in
explicating visitors’ decision-making process for environmentally
