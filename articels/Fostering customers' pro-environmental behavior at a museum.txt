ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Understanding visitors’ pro-environmental behavior is vital as
sustainability is currently a critical issue in the museum industry, yet
visitors’ pro-environmental decision-making process has not been
sufﬁciently investigated. This study ﬁlls this void in the extant tourism
literature. While the theoretical base for comprehending the nature of
museum visitors’ pro-environmental behaviors is still in the introduction
stage, our proposed framework for encouraging pro-environmental
behavior among museum visitors including cognitive variables, affective
variables, willingness to sacriﬁce, connectedness to nature and proenvironmental intentions was supported through empirical testing. The
present study also contributes to helping museum researchers and
practitioners clearly understand the dynamic role of each study construct
in generating museum visitors’ intentions for environmentally responsible
behaviors while visiting a museum.

Introduction
Museums are active in reducing their environmental impact. Museum professionals, funders, architects and engineers actively incorporate pro-environmental practices, principles, designs and technologies into the management, operation and facilities of museums (Brophy & Wylie, 2008). The proenvironmental issue in museums is continually growing (Merriman, 2008), and sustainability is
becoming a core concept in the museum industry (Wickham & Lehman, 2015). In line with this phenomenon, recent studies in diverse ﬁelds comprising consumer behavior, marketing, hospitality, leisure and tourism have stated that pro-environmental customers are growing in a rapid manner (Han,
2015; Ho, Liao, Huang, & Chen, 2015; Lee, Kim, Kim, & Choi, 2014; Oguz, Cakci, & Kavas, 2010). These
customers are ecologically cautious, actively seeking an eco-friendly product rather than conventional ones, and willingly accept inconvenience if necessary (Davis, Le, & Coy, 2011; Rahman & Reynolds, 2016; Thøgersen, 2000). Pro-environmental behavior is such behavior as eco-friendly
purchasing and recycling, which minimize the human inﬂuence on the natural environment (Han,
Lee, & Hwang, 2016; Wolfe & Shanklin, 2001).
Visitors’ pro-environmental behavior in museums could signiﬁcantly reduce the environmental
impact and thus its importance has been increasingly recognized in recent years (Byers, 2008; Merriman, 2008; Wickham & Lehman, 2015; Worts, 2004, 2006). Similar to visiting other tourist sites,
museum customers’ behaviors include selecting a transportation option, eating in restaurants, drinking tea/coffee/beverage in caf
es, resting in designated areas, participating in diverse visitor programs, enjoying art work and purchasing products in gift shops. That is, these behavioral elements of
museum visits are close to travelers’ behavior in other tourist places. Museums include caf

restaurants, restrooms, rest areas and gift shops where visitors’ pro-environmental behavior is essential for the decrease of solid wastes, food wastes and water usage. Indeed, visitors’ behavior, along
with their experiences, is regarded as one of the most critical factors for museum management
(Yoshimura et al., 2014). Pro-environmental management is already an important aspect of the consumer market (Akehurst, Afonso, & Helena, 2012; Claver-Cort
es, Molina-Azorın, Pereira-Moliner, &
pez-Gamero, 2007; Han, 2015). In addition, it is regarded to be an imperative requisite for the sucLo
cess of museums (Wickham & Lehman, 2015). Given the pro-environmental behavior phenomenon
in the museum industry and consumer marketplace, comprehending museum customers’ pro-environmental decision-making process and behavior and knowing the triggers of such processes and
actions is becoming increasingly more crucial in the museum industry under the pro-environmental
movement.
The existing literature has indicated that the vital antecedents of pro-environmental decisions and
behaviors are cognitive factors (e.g. environmental value, ecological concern, environmental knowledge, self-efﬁcacy and environmental awareness) (Bandura, 1997; Chan, Hon, Chan & Okumus, 2014;
Fairweather & Maslin, 2005; Huang, 2016; Lee et al., 2014; Oguz et al., 2010; Tabernero & Hernandez,
2011) and affective factors (e.g. positive and negative anticipated affects) (Han, 2014; Harth, Leach, &
Kessler, 2013; Onwezen, Antonides, & Bartels, 2013; Onwezen, Bartels, & Antonides, 2014). In particular, a positive and signiﬁcant impact of cognitive process and affective process has been reported on
eco-friendly intention and behavior in a variety of contexts (Harth et al., 2013; Oguz et al., 2010; Tabernero & Hernandez, 2011) comprising the tourism sector (Han, 2014). Despite the inﬂuence of these
processes, cognitive and affective factors are not the only triggers of pro-environmental behavior.
Researchers also agree that a willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature are decisive in
anticipating individuals’ eco-friendly behaviors (e.g. Gosling & Williams, 2010; Mayer & Frantz, 2004;
Rahman & Reynolds, 2016; Thøgersen, 2000). These researchers empirically identiﬁed the important
role of readiness to sacriﬁce (Rahman & Reynolds, 2016) and feeling of interconnection with the natural world (Gosling & Williams, 2010) in guiding environmental decisions and behaviors.
Nevertheless, surprisingly, in environmental studies, the association between cognitive and affective processes in the formation of pro-environmental intention has received relatively less attention
than the direct relationships between cognition and intention and between affect and intention. In
addition, studies that have incorporated willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature into
the framework comprising cognitive and affective processes are scarce in environmental psychology.
An integrated theoretical framework involving these critical drivers of pro-environmental decision
was, therefore, of utmost criticality to be able to more clearly and comprehensively explicate visitors’
complicated decision-making process in the museum industry.
From this perspective, the objectives of this research are to investigate the convoluted relationships among cognitive factors (i.e. environmental value, environmental concern, environmental
awareness, environmental knowledge and self-efﬁcacy), affective factors (positive anticipated affect
and negative anticipated affect), willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature in explaining
the formation of customers’ pro-environmental intentions for environmentally responsible behavior
while visiting a museum. In particular, we attempted to assess the prediction ability of the proposed
research framework comprising such relationships for museum visitors’ environmentally responsible
decisions, to test the comparative importance of study variables in generating pro-environmental
intentions, and to assess the mediating role of affective process. Given that museum customers’ proenvironmental decision-making process or behavior is one of the least known areas in tourism literature, the present research and its results offer original and valuable insights into this emerging topic,
which are of great importance to museums.

Theoretical background and hypotheses
Our theoretical framework is comprised of ﬁve cognitive dimensions (i.e. environmental value, environmental concern, environmental awareness, environmental knowledge and self-efﬁcacy), two

1242

affective dimensions (i.e. positive and negative anticipated affects), willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature as triggers of customers’ pro-environmental intentions at a museum.

Cognitive Factors
The ﬁrst cognitive variable is environmental value. According to Schwartz (1994), human values represent “desirable, trans-situational goals that vary in importance, and serve as guiding principles in
the life of a person or other social entity” (p. 21). These values are regarded to be crucial as they inﬂuence diverse types of decision formation and behavior (Hwang & Hyun, 2016; Lee & Hyun, 2016;
Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano, & Kalof, 1999; Stern & Dietz, 1994). Among biospheric, egoistic, and
altruistic value orientations, researchers agree that biospheric value is particularly relevant to environmental intentions, preferences and behaviors (Steg, Perlaviciute, et al., 2014; Stern, 2000; Van der
Werff, Steg, & Keizer, 2013). This environment-speciﬁc (biospheric) value and environmental value
are interchangeably used in the literature (Han, 2015).
The second cognitive factor is environmental concern. Environmental concern is often described
as one’s global attitude toward the environment, which reﬂects the extent to which he/she worries
about the environmental issues and threats (Lee et al., 2014). This concept is thus closely associated
with one’s apprehensions about the environmental deteriorations, the balance of nature, the abuse
of the environment, the limited natural resources, etc. (Han, 2015; Paco & Raposo, 2009; Stern et al.,
1999). Although individuals’ level of ecological concern does not always result in pro-environmental
purchasing behaviors, it is likely that individuals highly concerned for the environment engage in
ecologically favorable purchasing behaviors in a more intense way (Paco & Raposo, 2009; Straughan
& Roberts, 1999).
The third cognitive factor is environmental awareness. It refers to individuals’ understanding
of the inﬂuence of human behavior on the nature and the environment surrounding themselves
(Kollmuss & Agyeman, 2002). Similarly, Schwartz’s (1977) early description indicated that this concept
is the level of a person’s awareness about adverse consequences for objects, which he/she values,
when not properly conducting a behavior pro-environmentally or pro-socially. Hence, environmental
awareness is often utilized interchangeably with the term adverse consequences of valued objects
(Han, 2015). Environmental awareness has long been believed as a decisive concept guiding individuals’ environmentally responsible behavior (Bamberg & Schmidt, 2003; Chan et al., 2014; Han & Yoon,
2015).
The fourth cognitive factor is environmental knowledge. This variable is regarded to be an impor€lﬁng, & Fuhrer,
tant precondition of ecological intention and behavior (Chan et al., 2014; Kaiser, Wo
1999). This cognitive factor refers to individuals’ capability to identify or understand various ecologically associated symbols, concepts, issues, problems and behavior (Laroche, Toffoli, Kim, & Muller,
1996). Individuals often avoid a situation in which their knowledge or understanding to direct their
behavior is not enough (Chan et al., 2014). That is, individuals tend to minimize possible uncertainty
by not engaging in a particular action when their knowledge level insufﬁciently guides such behavior. Environmental knowledge, therefore, is widely believed to inﬂuence individuals’ pro-environmental decision-making process and behavior (Boo & Park, 2013; Kaiser et al., 1999; Oguz et al., 2010).
The last cognitive factor is self-efﬁcacy. This concept indicates the strength of an individual’s belief
in his/her own ability to organize the courses of required actions to complete the tasks and attain the
goals (Wood & Bandura, 1989). Self-efﬁcacy has been demonstrated to be the central concept in the
contemporary psychology literature (Judge, Jackson, Shaw, Scott, & Rich, 2007). According to Vancouver, Moore, and Yoder (2008), self-efﬁcacy is one of the most widely accepted forms of expectancy
belief in applied psychology. The concept of self-efﬁcacy and its role is also believed to be important
in pro-social or pro-environmental behaviors (Huang, 2016; Tabernero & Hernandez, 2011). This cognitive variable is regarded as a major driver of pro-environmental intention (Bandura, 1997; Huang,
2016), interplaying with affective evaluation process (Tabernero & Hernandez, 2011). Overall, while
some researchers indicate the possible associations among some of the cognitive variables employed

JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM

1243

in the present research (e.g. Stern, 2000; Stern et al., 1999), these constructs with cognitive nature act
as independent contributors of pro-environmental intention and behavior without interrelations
(Chan et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014).

Affective Factors
In the present study, positive and negative anticipated affects are constituents of affective factors.
Bagozzi, Baumgartner, and Pieters (1998) indicated that anticipated affects are individuals’ emotions
that they expect to experience by attaining a desired goal. Similarly, Perugini and Bagozzi (2001)
described anticipated affects whose functions are decisive antecedents in human decision-making
process as “anticipated post-behavioral affective reactions” (p. 81). These anticipated affects are likely
to be positive or negative, particularly in a pro-environmental context (Han, 2014). In environmental
behaviors, both positive and negative anticipated forms of affects are elicited when individuals feel
responsible for his/her behavior and evaluate this behavior concerning a set of social or personal
standards (Onwezen et al., 2014; Tracy & Robins, 2007). It is likely that most individuals strive toward
feeling positive anticipated emotions and avoid feeling negative anticipated emotions (Kang, Manthiou, Kim, & Hyun, 2016; Lee & Hyun, 2015; Onwezen et al., 2014). Afterward, these anticipated
affects guide pro-environmental behavior with respect to social or personal standards (Onwezen
et al., 2014).
In a pro-environmental sector, among diverse expected forms of self-conscious affects, Han (2014)
asserted that proud, conﬁdent, accomplished and worthwhile are the central aspects of positive
anticipated affect; and guilty, bad and remorseful are the main facets of negative anticipated affect.
Han’s (2014) assertion was in line with Onwezen et al.’s (2013) indication about the criticality of these
items. Many existing studies in environmental psychology have partly or entirely utilized these items
to properly evaluate individuals’ favorable and unfavorable anticipated feelings with respect to
engaging in a particular pro-environmental behavior (Harth et al., 2013; Onwezen et al., 2014). These
researchers empirically explored the function of anticipated affective reactions along with cognitive
factors in explaining individuals’ eco-friendly decision-making process and behavior. It is evident that
anticipated feelings trigger one’s pro-environmental intention and behavior, mediating the impact of
their antecedents (Han, 2014; Harth et al., 2013; Onwezen et al., 2013, 2014).

Relationship between cognitive and affective factors
Studies in the extant literature on pro-social and pro-environmental behaviors have indicated that
the formation of individuals’ pro-social or pro-environmental decision is largely on the basis of the
€ser, 2007; Bierhoff, 2002; Han et al.,
interplay between cognitive and affective factors (Bamberg & Mo
2016; Steg & Vlek, 2009; Tabernero & Hernandez, 2011). Bierhoff (2002) identiﬁed that these concepts
€ser
are strongly associated and this relationship inﬂuences pro-social intention. Bamberg and Mo
(2007) demonstrated that both cognitive and affective constructs contribute to activating one’s
moral ecological norm, triggering environmentally responsible behaviors. In particular, their ﬁnding
indicated that one’s cognitive level of environmental awareness elicits his/her anticipated feelings of
guilt, which is a core aspect of negative anticipated affect.

Willingness to sacriﬁce
Van Lange, Agnew, Harinck, and Steemers (1997) described willingness to sacriﬁce as “foregoing
one’s own immediate self-interests to promote the well-being of the partner or relationship”
(p. 1331). That is, an individual’s sacriﬁcing for his/her own preferences or beneﬁts for the sake of the
partner’s favored outcome enriches the relationship, demonstrating his/her dedication for such relationship (Davis et al., 2011). Similarly, in an environmental context, Davis et al. (2011) described willingness to sacriﬁce for the environment as “the extent to which individuals’ decisions will take into

1244

H. HAN AND S. S. HYUN

account the well-being of the environment, even at the expense of immediate self-interest, effort, or
costs” (p. 259). The term “willingness,” along with intention and decision, includes a conative nature
rather than cognitive nature (Oliver, 1997, 1999). Thus, willingness to sacriﬁce conceptually differs
from cognitive variables within our theoretical framework. Individuals’ decision-making taking the
needs of the natural world into account rather than their likely personal beneﬁts is of utmost importance for motivating environmentally responsible behavior (Iwata, 2002).
One’s willingness to sacriﬁce for the natural environment is highly associated with his/her attention paid to eco-friendly products and leads to environmentally responsible purchase intentions
(Thøgersen, 2000). Individuals with a high willingness to sacriﬁce for the protection of the environment more actively engage in pro-environmental behaviors (Iwata, 2002). Rahman and Reynolds
(2016) provided empirical evidences that green hotel guests exhibiting high willingness to sacriﬁce
for the conservation of the natural world (e.g. giving up things that they like doing if they are harmful
for the environment; doing things for the natural environment willingly even though they are not
thanked for their efforts) have great environmentally signiﬁcant intentions to visit, sacriﬁce and pay
more for green hotels. In these studies, a high degree of willingness to sacriﬁce, therefore, acts as a
focal trigger of pro-environmental intentions and behaviors.

Connectedness to nature
One’s pro-environmental actions often increase with connectedness to nature (Dutcher, Finley, Luloff,
& Johnson, 2007; Mayer & Frantz, 2004; Schultz, 2001; Schultz, Shriver, Tabanico, & Khazian, 2004).
According to Nord, Luloff, and Bridger (1998), forest recreation activities (e.g. hiking, ﬁshing, camping,
hunting, bird watching) and pro-environmental behaviors are strongly linked, and the connectedness
of nature ultimately supports pro-environmental policies. Schultz (2001) described connectedness to
nature as the extent to which a person feels that he/she is a part of the natural world. When an individual feels a strong connectedness to nature, the person generally feels a high affective attachment
to nature, feels closeness to his/her natural surroundings, feels personal bonds with the natural world
around him/her, and believes that his/her welfare is connected to the welfare of the surrounding natural world (Dutcher et al., 2007; Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Attachment to nature often broadens individuals’ identify or self-deﬁnition (Mayer & Frantz, 2004; Schultz et al., 2004). The level of individuals’
sympathy and willingness to help for nature in general enlarges when such feeling of connectivity to
the natural world increases (Gosling & Williams, 2010; Mayer & Frantz, 2004).
There has been considerable interest in the association between connectedness to nature and
environmental behaviors (Dutcher et al., 2007; Gosling & Williams, 2010; Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Mayer
and Frantz (2004) identiﬁed that individuals who feel strong interconnectedness with their natural
surroundings are more likely to act in a pro-environmental way. Dutcher et al. (2007) demonstrated
that one’s feeling of connectivity to nature sufﬁciently predicts one’s environmentally responsible
decision and behavior. Gosling and Williams (2010) also demonstrated that individuals act in an ecofriendly way more frequently when they feel they are a part of nature. These studies support the
strong link between connectedness to nature and pro-environmental behavior.

Research model and hypotheses
The proposed conceptual model for this study is shown in Figure 1. The model contains a total of 10
variables and 14 research hypotheses:
H1: Environmental value signiﬁcantly inﬂuences positive anticipated affect.

Methodology
Data analysis
In the present study, we followed Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988) two-step approach. In particular, a
conﬁrmatory factor analysis employing a maximum likelihood estimation method was initially conducted to evaluate the measurement quality, reliability and construct validity of research variables.

1246

H. HAN AND S. S. HYUN

Subsequently, a structural equation modeling was employed to test the research hypotheses related to
causal relationships among study constructs. SPSS 20 and AMOS 20 were used as data analysis tools.

Measures
A survey questionnaire comprising 42 measurement items employed from previous studies (Bamberg &
Schmidt, 2003; Bandura, 2006; Cordano, Welcomer, Scherer, & Parada, 2011; Han, 2014, 2015; Kaiser
et al., 1999; Schwartz, 1992; Stern et al., 1999) in the extant literature on environmental behaviors was
developed. In particular, the questionnaire included the description of the study, questions for research
constructs and questions for demographic information. A seven-point scale was used for all measurement items. Of the 42 measurement items, 4 items were for environmental value (i.e. “Please indicate to
what extent the following is important as a guiding principle in your life” – [1] preventing pollution, [2]
respecting the earth, [3] unity with nature and [4] protecting the environment). These items were
adopted from Schwartz (1992) and Stern et al. (1999) and were evaluated using a seven-point scale
from “Not very important” (1) to “Very important” (7). Environmental concern was assessed with three
items (e.g. “The balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset”), which was adopted from Cordano
et al. (2011) and Han (2015). A total of three items were utilized to evaluate environmental awareness
(e.g. “The museum industry can possibly cause environmental deterioration [grey water and wastes
from restaurants, cafes, construction and other museum facilities, etc.]”). The items were employed from
Bamberg and Schmidt (2003) and Han (2014). Environmental knowledge was measured with three items
adopted from Kaiser et al. (1999) (e.g. “I agree that the world climate will probably massively change if
CO2 continues to be emitted into the atmosphere in as huge amounts as it is now”). In addition, we
used three items to assess self-efﬁcacy (e.g. “To what extent do you feel capable of following the
museum instructions to perform the required green practices during your visit to a museum?”). These
measures ranging from “Not at all conﬁdent” (1) to “Totally conﬁdent” (7) were from Bandura (2006).
Positive and negative anticipated emotions were evaluated with four items (i.e. “Image that you
practice environmentally responsible actions in a museum that minimizes its negative impact on the
environment. How would you feel?” – [1] proud, [2] accomplished, [3] conﬁdent and [4] worthwhile)
and three items (i.e. “Image that you fail to practice environmentally responsible actions in a museum
that minimizes its negative impact on the environment. How would you feel?” – [1] guilty, [2]
remorseful and [3] bad), respectively. These items ranging from “Not at all” (1) to “Very much” (7)
were employed from Han (2014) and Onwezen et al. (2013). A total of ﬁve items were used to measure willingness to sacriﬁce (e.g. “I am willing to give things up that I like doing if they harm the natural environment”). The items were from Davis et al. (2011). We also adopted 11 measurement items
to assess connectedness to nature from Gosling and Williams (2010) and Mayer and Frantz (2004)
(e.g. “I often feel a sense of oneness with the natural world around me”). Lastly, in order to evaluate
pro-environmental intentions, a total of three items were employed from Minton and Rose (1997)
and Stern et al. (1999) (e.g. “To be environmentally responsible, I will make an effort to practice ecofriendly actions [recycling, reducing water use, decreasing waste, eat local foods, etc.] in a museum”).
A Likert-type scale ranging from “Extremely disagree” (1) to “Extremely agree” (7) was used for the
measures of environmental concern, environmental awareness, environmental knowledge, willingness to sacriﬁce, connectedness to nature and pro-environmental intentions. The measurement
scales were thoroughly reviewed by academic experts in hospitality and tourism to increase face
validity. Subsequently, the survey questionnaire was pretested by tourism academics and museum
industry professionals. Our questionnaire was perfected through these processes.

Data collection and sample proﬁles
In the present study, a ﬁeld survey method was utilized. In particular, the data collection was conducted at ﬁve museums located in a metropolitan city in South Korea for about two weeks in the latter half of November 2015. With the rapid growth of international cultural inbound tourism (Lim &

JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM

1247

Bendle, 2012), pro-environmental management in museums and other tourist sites has become an
important requirement in South Korea. This phenomenon is in line with the Korean government’s
tourism policy related to the sustainable development of cultural tourism products. Environmental
issues are, therefore, gaining increasing attention from cultural tourism researchers and practitioners
in South Korea. The ﬁve museums, comprising of two art museums, a war museum, a folk museum
and a palace museum, were chosen based on industry and academic experts’ suggestions, as these
are the major national museums of the city where environmental management and practices are relatively well performed. Trained student surveyors approached visitors in caf
es and rest areas in the
museums and asked them to participate in the survey. Prior to ﬁlling out the questionnaire, the participants were thoroughly informed about the research purpose. Respondents’ participation in the
survey was completely voluntarily. The questionnaire was distributed and returned on-site in order
to increase the response rate. About 500 questionnaires were distributed to museum visitors through
this process; and a total of 340 questionnaires were returned. After removing unusable cases, we
used 321 completed responses for data analysis. A usable response rate was about 64.2%.
Of the 321 respondents, a total of 157 participants were males (48.9%) and 164 respondents were
females (51.1%). The participants’ average age is 30 years old. According to the statistics from the
Ministry of the Interior (2015) regarding demographic factors in Korea, the gender ratio is close to 1:1
(25,809,031 males vs. 25,840,521 females), and the mean age is 40 years old. Although our sample
population is somewhat young compared to the general South Korean population, it is fairly well representative of the entire population. Most of the participants were highly educated. In particular,
about 67.0% indicated that they earned a bachelor’s degree; 12.3% earned a graduate degree; 8.8%
of them were two-year or other college graduates; and 11.9% had a high school degree or less. The
participants’ average frequency of museum visits within the last year was two times.

Results
Measurement validation
A measurement model using the conﬁrmatory factor analysis was evaluated for measurement–quality testing. Results of the measurement model exhibited in Table 1 showed that the model includes
an appropriate ﬁt to the data (x2 D 1420.475, df D 771, p < .001, x2/df D 1.842, RMSEA D .051,
CFI D .938, IFI D .939, TLI D .931). Standardized loadings for the indicators of each construct were sufﬁciently high and all were signiﬁcant (p < .01). Composite reliability was calculated using

standardized factor loadings and measurement errors for the indicators for each variable. Values of
composite reliability for every construct fell between .833 and .930, which were greater than Bagozzi
and Yi’s (1988) suggested cutoff of .600. That is, the measurement items for each study variable are
internally consistent. As the next step, average variance extracted (AVE) values were computed. AVE
values fell between .549 and .813 and exceeded Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) suggested threshold of
.500. In addition, these AVE values shown in Table 1 were higher than the squared correlation
between variables. Overall, the results of the measurement model assessment wholly established
convergent and discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).

The structural model
A structural equation modeling comprising all research variables was conducted. Table 2 and Figure 2
present the summary of the structural model and hypotheses testing results. An examination of the
goodness-of-ﬁt statistics indicated that the proposed model ﬁt to the collected data well (x2 D
1496.140, df D 781, p < .001, x2/df D 1.916, RMSEA D .053, CFI D .932, IFI D .932, TLI D .925). In particular, the chi-square statistics revealed that the ratio of the x2 value related to the degree of freedom
(df) was below the suggested threshold of 2.000. In addition, other ﬁt indices indicated that the
model includes a reasonable explanation of the observed covariance among the research variables.
As shown in Table 2, the proposed model achieved a sufﬁcient level of goodness-of-ﬁt in accounting
for the total variance of pro-environmental intentions (R2 D .740) and positive (R2 D .510) and negative (R2 D .430) anticipated affects.
A further analysis on the relationships among the research constructs was conducted. First,
the hypothesized associations between cognitive factors and positive anticipated affect were tested
(H1–H5). Results showed that the impacts of environmental value (b D .220, p < .01), environmental
concern (b D .215, p < .01), environmental knowledge (b D .346, p < .01) and self-efﬁcacy (b D .182,
p < .01) on positive anticipated affect were signiﬁcant and positive. These results supported Hypotheses 1, 2, 4 and 5. This ﬁnding implies that environmental value, concern, knowledge and self-efﬁcacy
contribute to increasing positive anticipated affect. However, the proposed impact of environmental
awareness on positive affect was not signiﬁcant (b D .085, p > .05). That is, environmental awareness
was a contributor to increasing positive anticipated affect. Thus, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.
The relationships between cognitive variables and negative anticipated affect were evaluated. As
expected, environmental value (b D .163, p < .01), environmental knowledge (b D .206, p < .01) and
self-efﬁcacy (b D .396, p < .01) exerted a signiﬁcant and positive inﬂuence on negative anticipated
affect, thus supporting Hypotheses 6, 9 and 10. This result implies that environmental value, knowledge and self-efﬁcacy play an important role in reducing negative anticipated affect. Yet, the impact
of environmental concern (b D .109, p > .05) and environmental awareness (b D .013, p > .05) on
negative affect was not signiﬁcant. That is, environmental concern and awareness were not contributors to decreasing negative anticipated affect. Thus, Hypotheses 7 and 8 were not supported.
The hypothesized impacts of positive and negative anticipated affects on pro-environmental
intentions were tested. As expected, both relationships were signiﬁcant. Speciﬁcally, pro-environmental intentions were a positive function of positive (b D .313, p < .01) and negative (b D .421,
p < .01) anticipated affects. These ﬁndings supported Hypotheses 11 and 12. This ﬁnding implies
that positive and negative anticipated affects play a critical role in increasing or decreasing pro-environmental intentions. The proposed impact of willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature
on pro-environmental intentions was assessed. Our results revealed that both willingness to sacriﬁce
(b D .290, p < .01) and connectedness to nature (b D .101, p < .05) exerted a positive and signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on visitors’ pro-environmental intentions. Hence, our results were consistent with Hypotheses 13 and 14. That is, both willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature contribute to
enhancing pro-environmental intentions.
The indirect impacts of the study variables were examined. A bootstrap analysis, which is a
widely accepted approach to test the mediating impact of variables, was undertaken. This

analysis provides a comparatively straightforward way to verify the signiﬁcance of indirect effect
(Kenny, 2016). Our results indicated that environmental value, environmental concern, environmental knowledge and self-efﬁcacy have a positive and signiﬁcant impact on museum visitors’
pro-environmental intentions indirectly through anticipated affects (bEV–PAA & NAA–GI D .137,
p < .05; bEC–PAA & NAA–GI D .113, p < .01; bEK–PAA & NAA–GI D .195, p < .01; bS–PAA & NAA–GI D .224,
p < .01). These ﬁndings suggested that anticipated affects play a signiﬁcant mediating role in
the proposed theoretical framework. Subsequently, the total impact of modeled constructs was
assessed. The total inﬂuence of negative anticipated affect on intentions (b D .421, p < .01) was
the greatest among research variables, followed by positive anticipated affect (b D .313, p < .01),
willingness to sacriﬁce (b D .290, p < .01), self-efﬁcacy (b D .224, p < .01), environmental knowledge (b D .195, p < .01), environmental value (b D .137, p < .05), environmental concern
(b D .113, p < .05) and connectedness to nature (b D .101, p < .05).

Discussions
The proposed theoretical model was an attempt to clearly explicate museum visitors’ environmentally responsible decision-making process. In a museum context, there is very limited scholarly
research on visitors’ pro-environmental intention during their visit to a museum. The comprehensive
framework involving ﬁve cognitive factors, two affective variables, willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature was found to be useful and satisfactorily predict visitors’ pro-environmental
intentions. The hypothesized associations among the research variables were shown to be generally
supported. The test of the structural model identiﬁed the importance of anticipated affective process.
A signiﬁcant mediating role of positive and negative anticipated affects was identiﬁed. In sum, results
of this research provided an integrative and comprehensive framework for study variables and their
associations in the arena of museum visitors’ behaviors.
Although there were some previous efforts to integrate anticipated affects into social psychology
theories based on self-interest motives (e.g. model of goal-directed behavior and theory of repurchase decision-making) (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001, Han & Yoon, 2015), customers’ anticipated affective experiences and their role to explicate pro-social behavior in tourism have been largely
neglected. Our ﬁndings showed that the level of visitors’ anticipated affects play a decisive role in
generating pro-environmental intentions. In particular, the total impact of negative (b D .421,
p < .01) and positive (b D .313, p < .01) anticipated emotions on intentions was greater than other
research variables. This result supported Frijda’s (2007) and Han’s (2014) indication that customers
are, in general, eager to experience positive affect and evade a negative affective experience by performing a particular action in the future, and these expected feelings that have not been actually
experienced yet often guide their pro-social or pro-environmental decision-making. It was, in general,
unclear how anticipated emotional process inﬂuences visitors’ behavior in a museum sector. The current study is, therefore, theoretically meaningful since it offers an apparent understanding of the
active role of anticipated affects. Given this, from a practical point of view, it is important for museum
operators to let current and potential museum customers know that following the museum instructions to engage in the required pro-environmental practices when visiting a museum (e.g. recycling,
saving water, decreasing waste, public transportation use, walking more, eating local foods) is the
decent and worthwhile thing to do, and that visiting and attending a museum in ecologically
unfriendly ways has adverse effects for the environment.
A comparison of the relative importance between anticipated affect dimensions revealed that a
negative form of anticipated affect includes a stronger inﬂuence on pro-environmental decisions.
This ﬁnding supports the loss aversion related to the prospect theory that the effect of an individual’s
painful feeling of losing is greater than the effect of his/her pleasurable feeling of gaining (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979, 1992). In other words, customers would focus more on striving not to experience a
negative affect by conducting pro-environmental behavior when visiting a museum in the future
than on striving to have a positive affective experience. This ﬁnding includes a strong theoretical
meaning in that to the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the ﬁrst to empirically support the
effectiveness of the loss aversion of the prospect theory in a museum context. From a practical
aspect, in the present study setting, dealing with visitors’ negative anticipated affect should be the
priority for museum operators in that it is a more efﬁcient way to maximize their pro-environmental
decision-making and behaviors when visiting a museum.
Our results suggested that cognitive variables have a critical role in boosting visitors’ eco-friendly
intentions as the total impact of each cognitive dimension on intentions was all signiﬁcant
(bS D .224, p < .01; bEK D .195, p < .01; bEV D .137, p < .05; bEC D .113, p < .01). These results were
consistent with research ﬁndings in previous studies that emphasized the criticality of environmental
value (Steg, Bloderdijk et al., 2014; Stern, 2000), environmental concern (Ishaswini & Saroj, 2011; Lee
et al., 2014), environmental knowledge (Chan et al., 2014; Oguz et al., 2010) and self-efﬁcacy (Huang,
2016; Tabernero & Hernandez, 2011) in triggering individuals’ pro-social or pro-environmental decisions and behaviors. Given this ﬁnding, it is evident that customers’ decisions on whether they will

1252

H. HAN AND S. S. HYUN

practice pro-environmental actions when visiting a museum are based on their feeling of capability
related to engaging in eco-friendly actions, the level of environmental knowledge they hold, the
degree of environmental value they have as a guiding principle in their life, and the level of concern
for the environment they have.
Our ﬁnding also indicated that willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature partially
account for pro-environmental intentions. This result conﬁrms that individuals’ readiness to sacriﬁce
for the environment and their feeling of interconnection with the natural world play a crucial role in
building pro-environmental intentions while visiting a museum. This ﬁnding was in line with the
results of previous studies (Gosling & Williams, 2010; Mayer & Frantz, 2004; Rahman & Reynolds,
2016). In order to foster visitors’ pro-environmental behaviors, museum operators should inform and
stress the potential beneﬁts of activities for nature, the eco-system and wildlife. Theoretically, the
present research provides empirical evidence that individuals’ pro-environmental decision is still an
important and positive function of willingness to sacriﬁce for the natural environment and connectedness to nature even when other decisive cognitive and affective variables are involved in one
inclusive conceptual framework. In addition, our ﬁndings extend our understanding about the magnitude of the inﬂuence of willingness to sacriﬁce and connectedness to nature on eco-friendly intentions. The concepts of these variables should be, therefore, actively utilized as triggers of proenvironmental decision and behavior when developing a conceptual model or theory related to this
topic.
The relationships between environmental awareness and anticipated emotions in the present
study were found to be insigniﬁcant. This result is inconsistent with our proposition and Oliver’s
(1997) assertion that cognitive and affective factors are likely to be positively and signiﬁcantly associated. Therefore, the proposed impact of museum customers’ environmental awareness on anticipated emotions was not supported. Nevertheless, our insigniﬁcant result was still in line with
Schwartz’s (1977) theoretical framework with pro-social motives, where an affective process is not
linked to one’s awareness of consequences. Our result further indicated that the total impact of environmental awareness on pro-environmental intentions was not signiﬁcant. This ﬁnding implies that
unlike customers’ awareness level of general environmental problems resulting from general
environmentally unfriendly human behaviors, their awareness about environmental deteriorations
speciﬁcally derived from museums is not as much crucial as we expected in driving their pro-environmental intentions while visiting museums.
These anticipated affects were identiﬁed to signiﬁcantly mediate the inﬂuence of environmental
value, environmental concern, environmental knowledge and self-efﬁcacy on museum visitors’
environmentally responsible intentions. Indeed, the indirect impacts of these variables on intentions
were all signiﬁcant. This result is consistent with previous studies that stressed the important mediating role of anticipated affects (e.g. Hynie, MacDonald, & Marques, 2006; Su, Lu, & Lin, 2011; Onwezen
et al., 2013, 2014). Researchers should recognize and consider this signiﬁcant mediating nature of
anticipated affects when developing a conceptual framework comprising anticipated forms of affects
and extending an existing socio-psychological theory rooted in pro-social or pro-environmental
motives. Practically, for the maximum use of the impact of such cognitive variables as environmental
values, environmental concern, environmental knowledge and self-efﬁcacy on pro-environmental
decisions, efforts of boosting both anticipated affects and these cognitive factors should be made in
a simultaneous manner.
The present research includes several limitations. First, the sample population in this study consisted of museum customers in South Korea. According to recent studies (Lee & Lee, 2009; Yu & Ko,
2012), national culture affects travelers’ decision-making processes. In future research, in order to further conﬁrm this study’s ﬁndings, a broader range of samples from other countries with different cultural backgrounds should be included in order to better represent all environmentally responsible
museum customers. Second, questions asking the participants’ mode of travel and where they traveled from were not included in our survey questionnaire. For future research, the questionnaire
should include such important inquiries. In addition, it would be interesting to examine museum

JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM

customers’ travel model choice depending on their travel distance. Third, as indicated earlier,
although environmental value, awareness and knowledge are deﬁned distinctly, there exists some
conceptual similarity as environmental value can be also viewed as greater environmental awareness
and knowledge. Indeed, the correlation matrix indicates relatively high covariation across these cognitive factors. A more conceptually thorough research design is necessary for future research.

Conclusion
In the present research, we successfully developed the conceptual framework, comprising 10
research variables and 14 hypotheses linking research constructs, which has a sufﬁcient level of prediction ability for visitors’ pro-environmental intentions for environmentally responsible behaviors
while visiting a museum. This research goes beyond studies in the extant literature by testing and
identifying the role of each cognitive dimension, favorable and unfavorable aspects of affect, readiness to sacriﬁce, and connectedness to nature in forming visitors’ pro-environmental intentions in a
simultaneous manner, which has as of yet hardly been explored in the existing museum literature.
This research thus delivers meaningful implications to museum researchers and practitioners. In particular, this research helps to enrich the museum literature and helps museum professionals make
better strategies for encouraging pro-environmental decisions and behaviors through efﬁcient management of visitors’ motivation of sacriﬁce, interconnected feeling with the nature, and cognitive
and affective processes of pro-environmental decision-making. To conclude, given that visitors’
environmentally responsible decision-making process has rarely been researched and that the intricate associations among key cognitive variables in extant environmental studies, positive and negative anticipated forms of affect, readiness to sacriﬁce for green, and connectedness to nature have
seldom been examined in a museum context, the present study addressed these omissions and contributed to theorizing the unexplored relationships among these study variables in the formation of
customers’ pro-environmental intentions when visiting a museum.
