Visitor studies including studies of experience and expectations of visitors are important for museums
in terms of management and development, however few studies have been designed to explore the
components of experience expectations for museum visitors. This research tried to analyze the experience
expectations of museum visitors. Using content analysis of diaries written by museum visitors, a questionnaire of experience expectations of museum visitors was developed. After a survey with 425 valid
returns, factor analysis was used to extract 5 types of experience expectations, which included: easiness and
fun, cultural entertainment, personal identiﬁcation, historical reminiscences, and escapism. Moreover, this
research analyzed visitors’ preferences for visiting museums and their demographic factors among different
types of experience expectations. Finally, some related discussion and suggestions were proposed.

1. Introduction
In modern times, museums serve the functions of collection,
research and exhibition, as well as education and recreation. They
have gradually acquired visitor-based roles instead of museumbased roles. Thus, the need for visitor studies has emerged
(Weil, 2000). According to the Committee of Audience Research and
Evaluation in the American Association of Museums, visitor studies
use a systematic approach, including knowledge related to on-site
and potential visitors, which is used to assist museums with planning and executing public related activities (CARE, 2009). Housen
(1987) suggested three dimensions to acquire visitor knowledge:
to learn visitors’ demographic data, attitudinal information, and
developmental situations and varied factors. Hood (1983) urged
museum professionals to focus on the psychographic characteristics
of both current and potential visitors and particularly their values,
attitudes, perceptions, interests, expectations, satisfactions.
In studies on visitor attitude, Falk and Dierking (1992) proposed
an interactive experience model, and suggested that visitor experience is not necessarily passive. In the physical environment
of museums (the physical context), it is inﬂuenced both by personal
context and social context, which results in visitor experience.
Moreover, Falk and Dierking suggested that visitor experience is not
a static state, but is a dynamic process including experiences before,
during and after the visit. Therefore, in order to probe visitor

experience, it is necessary to probe visitor expectations before the
visit. During the visit, interaction among the three contexts could
be studied, and after the visit, the experience could be examined
according to the visitors’ memories.
The interactive experience model proposed by Falk and Dierking
(1992) emphasizes that experience is the process (before, during
and after the event), which results in interaction with inﬂuences
of different contexts. However, they did not clearly deﬁne “experience” which usually includes visitors’ opinions of functions (e.g.,
food and transportation), sensory stimulation (e.g., attraction of
buildings), and emotional description (e.g., bored or interesting). In
marketing ﬁelds, after Schmitt (1999) proposed the term “experiential marketing”, management scholars have started discussions
about the content of experience. They have a common consensus:
experience usually includes various elements, and it provides an
emotionally, physically, intellectually and spiritually mixed feeling
(Shaw & Ivens, 2002).
It is important to clearly deﬁne visitor experience. Although
a clear deﬁnition might narrow visitor experience, the operation
can become easier; thus, measurement tools can be developed and
modiﬁed. In addition, regarding the interactive experience model
of Falk and Dierking (1992), a measurement of visitor experience
or visitors’ expectations for experience will enhance the study on
the relationship between it and the three contexts. Through this,
managerial practices of museums can be enhanced. Therefore, this
study designed a questionnaire on museum visitor experience
using a qualitative approach according to the deﬁnition of experience by Shaw and Ivens (2002). It further analyzed museum visitors
on types of experience expectations by taking measurements in

advance, and compared the relationship among different expectations and demographic factors.
2. Literature review
Falk (1998) acknowledges that human behavior, including
museum-going, is a complex subject and that measurements of
demographic categories alone cannot offer any insights into understanding visitors and particularly non-visitors. Therefore, Liu (2008)
suggested that in order to offer exhibitions and services suitable for
visitors, museums have to conduct visitor studies and systematically
acquire knowledge related to visitors, and apply it to planning and
decision-making. Liu also divided museum visitor studies into three
categories: 1) visitor evaluation studies: emphasizing the purpose of
application, with the evaluation of museums, activities and exhibitions conducted according to the results; 2) visitor market studies:
collecting visitors’ reactions and probing into visitors’ views and
emotions; 3) exploratory studies of theoretical validation: precise
academic research upon different subjects, such as psychology and
sociology.
This study falls between the second and third categories of visitor
study, and probes into content of museum experience expectations
of visitors from the perspectives of marketing, psychology and
cultural sociology. The experience expectation of visitors refers to
the museum-visiting experience expected by visitors. It is similar to
the visiting experience; however, visitors’ expectations are investigated in advance. Literatures on visitor study are elaborated below.
Trauer (2006) suggested that tourism involves an experiential and
emotional nature. Many tourist studies have probed the causes
and results of tourist experiences (Cohen, 2008; Weaver, Weber, &
McCleary, 2007). Tourist experience in these studies is similar to
visitor experience in museum studies. Thus, related literature will
also be discussed.
Many studies have indicated that museum visitors are diverse, and
different visitors usually visit different museums at different times
(Falk & Dierking, 1992; Hooper-Greenhill, 2006). For instance, during
weekdays, student groups are the main visitors, but on holidays,
small groups such as parents with children are the most common.
However, Housen (1987) indicated that visitors’ knowledge could still
be obtained from three dimensions, including visitors’ demographic
data, attitudinal information, as well as their developmental situations. It is difﬁcult to investigate visitors’ development, since this
entails investigating their logic and degree of comprehension.
Visitors’ demographic attributes include gender, age and educational
level, and are traditional investigation items. However, Housen suggested further studying visitors’ attitude.
Attitude means what people prefer, be it a thing, activity or
character (Robbins & Judge, 2007), and can be divided into preattitude and post-attitude. However, most studies on attitude have
probed into the relationship between attitude and action. In other
words, pre-attitude is the main concern (post-attitude is usually
replaced by satisfaction). Moreover, attitude includes three dimensions: cognition, affection and action (Aronson, Wilson, & Akert,
2007). Attitude measurement related to action, such as the possibility to visit museums, can best predict the relation between
attitude and action. However, it is also the most restricted, since it
measures attitude by action. Hood (1983) identiﬁed the following six
criteria of a desirable leisure experience: (1). being with people or
social interaction; (2). doing something worthwhile; (3). feeling
comfortable and at ease in one’s surroundings; (4). having a challenge of new experiences; (5). having an opportunity to learn;
(6).participating actively.
Falk and Dierking (1992) indicated that museum visitors’ preattitude toward the visiting experience is inﬂuenced by visitor
expectations, and is a part of personal context. Since visitor

expectations signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the visiting experience, and
visitors’ post-memory is usually related to pre-expectations (Loomis,
1993), it is important to probe into visitor expectations. Although
Falk and Dierking proposed many factors of visitor expectation,
including prior experience, information sources, types of museums
and companions, all of which inﬂuence visitor expectations, they did
not suggest the content of visitor expectations. According to their
main statement, visitor expectations should be the visitors’ expectations for the visiting experience. However, Falk and Dierking
did not deﬁne the content of the visiting experience and thus the
assumption above cannot be veriﬁed. The content or types of visitor
experience expectations remain to be deﬁned.
Although Falk and Dierking (1992) did not explain the content of
visitors’ experiences and visitors’ experience expectations, they
proposed an interactive experience model regarding factors of the
experience. They suggested that visitor experience is the result of
the interaction among personal, social and environmental contexts.
The model has been cited by many studies and has led to further
studies on museum visitors’ interactive experiences. For instance,
regarding the usage of theatre in museums, Liu (2008) probed into
the interaction between visitors and museums, as well as the
effect on visitors’ learning. She suggested that museums are a place
of exchange for telling and listening to stories. Thus, in a physical
environment, guide tour or exhibition, there is usually a form of
theatre in which visitors can participate. Visitors’ participation
could enhance their learning. Participation is important, and when
visiting museums, visitors could be prepared for active participation. For instance, before the visit, they could absorb information
and prepare notebooks. They could also wear comfortable clothes
and shoes when visiting. Relaxation is particularly important for
visitors who rarely visit museums, therefore, more participation
during their visit would enrich their experience (Liu, 2008).
Sheng, Shen, and Chen (2008) treated museum visits as historic
and artistic trips. Hertzman, Anderson, and Rowley (2008) indicated
that with development of multimedia techniques, the boundaries
between different museum trips, such as historic museums, historic
parks and life museums have become insigniﬁcant. However, they
revealed the effect of edutainment, which allow visitors to have
active and passive experiences.
If museum visits are regarded as a kind of trip, the tourist experience in a tourism study will then be the same as the visitor experience in a museum study. Research on tourist experiences has been
developed during the last ﬁfty years, according to Uriely (2005), and
during this time there have been four shifts. At the beginning, most
studies indicated that a tourist experience is a unique experience
different from daily life. The ﬁrst shift that occurred emphasized the
tourist experience as part of the daily consumption experience. The
second shift indicated pluralizing the tourist experience; in other
words, different tourists will have different experiences. In the third
shift, that of the role of subjectivity suggested by Uriely, researchers
started recognizing that tourists’ active interpretation of situations
will inﬂuence their experience. Finally, the fourth was called the shift
of relative interpretations. Researchers began believing that experience is a person’s interpretation of situations in the culture and
times visited. The perspective is extremely similar to the interactive
experience model proposed by Falk and Dierking (1992).
From the perspective of relative interpretation, Larsen and
Mossberg (2007) suggested that experience is a kind of subjective
and personalized process, which is related to society, culture
and even different systems. Since visitors or tourists are diverse in
various types of trips, including museum visits (Wang, 2008), the
content of the tourist experience also changes. Therefore, Larsen and
Mossberg suggested that study on the tourist experience should be
have ﬂexible and multiple perspectives, such as inter-discipline
studies upon marketing, psychology, culture and sociology. O’Dell

C.-W. Sheng, M.-C. Chen / Tourism Management 33 (2012) 53e60

(2007) agreed with the view from the perspective of cultural
sociology, and indicated that in postmodern society, tourists are no
longer pure receivers, observers or interpreters; instead, they are
active experientialists and even meaningful creators and actors.
Thus, study on visitors or tourists should focus on “being there” and
be close to visitors or tourists instead of observing from a distance.
Regarding tourists’ active and passive experiences, Joseph
and Gilmore (1998) suggested that both experiences are possible.
According to tourists’ involvement, experience was divided into
educational or escapist active participation. The tourists actively
participated and were involved in situations, and they created
varied experiences in the process. Passive tourist experiences
includes esthetic or entertainment experience. These tourists have
experiences using the varied esthetic or entertaining activities
“provided”. However, Joseph and Gilmore indicated that active and
passive experiences could co-exist. In other words, there is interaction between tourists and various systems. When tourists accept
materials “provided”, they can actively participate in and form the
experience during the visit. Thus, the tourists would have positive
experiences.
In addition to O’Dell (2007), Borrie and Roggenbuck (2001),
Larsen (2007) and Loomis (1993) also proposed a multi-stage
experience model similar to the view of Falk and Dierking (1992).
For instance, from the perspective of psychology, Larsen suggested
that the tourist experience is not simply the feeling during the trip;
instead, it is the accumulated psychological phenomenon, including
mutual inﬂuences of the three stages. According to Larsen, tourists
tend to expect possible events during the process because of planning in advance. It will inﬂuence the actual feelings and memories
during and after the visit. Noticeably, Larsen emphasized that tourists’ memories will change the expectation for the next visit, creating
a circular pattern. The points are mentioned but not emphasized in
the research of Falk and Dierking.
Although Larsen (2007), and Falk and Dierking (1992) indicated
that the expectations of tourists or visitors for experience is critical,
they did not clarify the content of the experience, or indicate if they
could extract common experience characteristics in multiple visitor
experiences. The point is rarely mentioned in studies on museum
visitors. However, without distinguishing any common characteristics of experience, it is difﬁcult for related research to measure
visitors’ expectations for experience, and they cannot perform
a proper analysis. For instance, assuming that expectation A inﬂuences the actual experience. It is suggested (according to analysis)
that expectation B and expectation A are the same type; otherwise,
it is difﬁcult to apply the ﬁndings to the relationship between other
expectations and actual experiences. Thus, according to the experience deﬁnition of Shaw and Ivens (2002), this study designed
a questionnaire by collecting qualitative data of museum visitor
experiences. By investigating in advance, the researcher analyzed
the different types of museum visitor expectations and conducted
correlation comparison.
3. Research method
According to Chiou, Wan, and Lee (2008), and Larsen (2007),
tourists’ expectations for experience are usually based on the
interaction between tourists and trips or visiting systems, including
reading brochures in advance, virtual experiences on the Internet
or past tourism and visiting experiences. Using museum visitors’
past visiting experiences as texts, this study extracted the themes
in an interactive record between visitors and visiting systems for
content analysis, in order to design a questionnaire on museum
visitor experiences. By investigating before the visit, and using
factor analysis, different types of visitor experience expectations
were developed (see Fig. 1).

Regarding the questionnaire design, using the factor “being there”
suggested by O’Dell (2007), the researcher visited ﬁve museums,
including Taiwan Museum, The Museum of Drinking Water, National
Museum of History, National Taiwan Science Education Center
and Miniatures Museum of Taiwan, and wrote a museum diary using
a backpacker’s writing style. These ﬁve museums were selected
based on Burcaw (1997), who suggested three types of museum,
including museums that collect or exhibit artistic works, museums
that collect or exhibit human historical relics, and museums related
to science and technology. After designing the questionnaire, this
study would investigate visitors to these three types of museum.
Therefore, the researcher visited the museums, recorded and
designed the questionnaire by selecting a museum of artistic works
(Miniatures Museum of Taiwan), museums of historical relics
(Taiwan Museum and National Museum of History) and museums of
science and technology (The Museum of Drinking Water and
National Taiwan Science Education Center).
After writing the museum diary, this study invited ﬁve museum
lovers to visit different museums either independently or with
companions and write diaries. Snowballed sampling was adopted
for the selection of subjects. This type of sampling was commonly
used in early or exploratory researches. Among the samples, if there
were a speciﬁc group that did not frequently interact with the
external world, that sampling would be appropriate. This study ﬁrst
invited a Guzheng (Chinese zither) teacher who frequently visited
museums to participate in and recommend three suitable subjects
from different industries, who often visited museums. Thus, the

selection would meet the phenomenon of multiple museum visitors.
The researcher then conﬁrmed the candidates’ intention by phone.
In order to avoid homogeneity among friends, one candidate
was invited upon each recommendation. The participants were then
invited to recommend three other candidates. After repeating the
method four times, four other participants were invited, including
one graduate school student who had won a literature award in
school, an assistant in a design company, a clerk in a tourism agency
and an employee of a Japanese dessert company.
Besides following the above backpacker writing style, this study
also invited participants (including the researcher) to write their
various experiences during the visit as events in separate paragraphs. They were asked to describe each event plus their emotional,
physical, intellectual and spiritual changes, including varied kinds of
feelings, actions, thoughts or interactions and connections with
others. For instance, the graduate school student wrote the following
event:
The appearance of the building is a baroque style: there are four
elegant and delicate big stone pillars standing out of the gate
and a unique dome that can be recognized from a distance. With
specially modeled streetlights at the entrance and a heavy steel
door, the museum harmonizes with the classic old locomotive
engine, gun platform and monumental archway in the park
nearby. (Taiwan Museum)
After ﬁnishing writing the diaries, this study conducted content
analysis on them. First, the researcher extracted the theme of
each diary, collecting data with similar thoughts or feelings and
expressing them by complete sentences. Thus, an event might
include one or several themes. When different themes were similar,
the researcher would only keep one of them. In total, there were
134 themes developed. According to the similarity degree, the
themes were divided into 21 categories.
This study invited three visitors who were familiar with content
analysis, frequently visited museums and had related books published, including a university professor, a writer and a member who
had held a membership of one resort for more than ten years, to
check the propriety of categorization and naming. According to the
intersubjective principle, they assisted with coding of themes.
After the description of deﬁnitions and coding rules, the researcher
invited the three visitors to indicate their agreement with the
categorization and naming of the categories and themes under the
categories. After the coding, the researcher obtained an interceder
agreement of 0.8 and further acquired a coding reliability of 0.92. It
demonstrated that the three coders shared a similar view regarding
the categorization, naming and classiﬁcation of themes.
In addition, this study invited three coders to select 0e2
representative themes among those in the categories agreed
according to the descriptions of the categories. The researcher
selected the representative themes agreed on by at least two coders
and combined the meanings of the categories to design 21 items of

a Likert visitor experience questionnaire. Subsequently, ten
university students and two doctoral students read the ﬁrst draft of
the questionnaire and conducted semantic feedback. They modiﬁed
the items with unclear meanings in order to enhance the validity
of the questionnaire. Formative examples of items of the visitor
experience questionnaire are shown in Table 1.
Besides a survey on the expectations for visitor experience, this
study also inquired about the participants’ demographic data,
including gender, age, educational level, marital status and personal
monthly income. The ﬁrst three items are common data in surveys
on museum visitors (Housen, 1987). Marital status was included
because parents and children are usually museum visitors during
holidays, and it also reﬂects a person’s family life cycle. Thus, this
study could probe the relationship between the family life cycle and
the experience expectations of visitors. Personal monthly income
was included based on Falk and Dierking (1992), who suggested
that personal economic status will inﬂuence visitors’ museumvisiting behavior. Therefore, this variable was included to compare
the relationship between different economic status (monthly
income) and visiting experience expectations. The complete questionnaire is shown in the appendix. However, items related to
visitor experience have been changed into items of experience
expectations of visitors.
After ﬁnishing the questionnaire design, this study started
a formal survey. In order to include three types of museums as
indicated by Burcaw (1997) and avoid presenting characteristics of

visitors in only one area, this study selected four museums with
different characteristics in northern, central, southern and eastern
Taiwan using itineraries recommended on the Taiwan cultural
trip webpage of the Tourism Bureau, Ministry of Transportation &
Communication (Tourism Bureau, Ministry of Transportation &
Communications, 2009). The museums included the National
Palace Museum in Taipei (historical relics; itinerary A of a two-day
trip in Taipei), the Wood Sculpture Museum in Miaoli (artistic
works; itinerary of a two-day wood sculpture trip in Sanyi), the
National Science and Technology Museum in Kaohsiung (science
and technology; itinerary of a two-day cultural and historic relic
trip in Kaohsiung) and the National Museum of Prehistory in Taitung
(science and technology; itinerary of a two-trip aboriginal trip in
Hualien and Taitung). On two weekends and two weekdays, with
two or three people in a group, systematic sampling was conducted.
One questionnaire was distributed to every ﬁfteenth visitor from the
opening to the closing time (apart from food and rest time) of
the museums. Small gifts were provided to encourage participation.
Since Yeh and Lawrence (1996) suggested that a sample size of
factor analysis above 200 could signiﬁcantly enhance reliability, this

study aimed to retrieve 400 valid questionnaires (100 questionnaires for each museum). In total, there were 425 valid samples.

This study reorganized the demographic variables of the
participants with returned questionnaires, as shown in Table 2.
The participants are mostly unmarried female visitors aged 20e40
years old. Most of the participants are graduated from universities
or colleges and have personal monthly incomes below NTD 50,000.
A discrimination test was conducted according to the items of the
experience expectation questionnaire, and t-test was conducted on
the ﬁrst 1/4 groups with higher scores and the latter 1/4 groups with
lower scores in each item. If there is no signiﬁcant difference, the
discrimination power of the item is insigniﬁcant and the item would
be eliminated. Items 11 and 15 are ﬁnally eliminated. In addition,
factor analysis was conducted on the other 19 items of experience
expectation in order to have maximum explanation of the total
variance by the least common factors. Five latent factors with
eigenvalue > 1 were extracted. The relationship between the items

and factors was determined using varimax rotation. According to
suggestion of Hair, Anderson, Tatham, and Black, (1998), when one
item reveals a highest factor loading above 0.45, the item will be
allocated in the factor. However, when the item is among different
factors and the gap of factor loading is less than 0.1, the gap of the
item in different factors is insigniﬁcant. The item should thus be
eliminated. In total, ﬁve items were eliminated. 18 items were kept,
and they were allocated to ﬁve factors.
After extracting the factors, based on the items with higher
factor loading in different factors, this study named the factors. For
instance, factor 3 was based on item 18 “When visiting the museums,
I expect to be identiﬁed, such as having companions of similar
interests” and Item 19 “When visiting the museums, I expect to be
close to the core characters related to the subjects, such as having
conversations or taking pictures with the main character after
watching the performance”. Therefore, factor 3 was named “personal
identiﬁcation”. Other factors were named “easiness and fun”,
“cultural entertainment”, “historical reminiscence” and “escapism”.
The accumulated variance of the factor was 0.6. The factor analysis
result is shown in Table 3.
Regarding reliability test of factors (see Table 3), this study
examined internal consistency using Cronbach a. The a of easiness
and fun was 0.81, cultural entertainment was 0.75, personal
identiﬁcation was 0.78, historical reminiscence was 0.63 and
escapism was 0.75. Since a values are approximate to or above 0.7,
the questionnaire revealed a certain degree of reliability (Cuieford,
1965; Nunnally, 1978).
Besides using factor analysis to develop the different types of
museum experience expectations, the researcher also compared
museum-visiting preferences with demographic data of the participants in the different types. The questionnaire asked the participants about their preferences for visiting museums and conducted
One-way ANOVA on experience expectations. The results are
shown in Table 4. Experience expectations and the participants’
demographic factors were compared using One-way ANOVA on
gender and marital status. The results are shown in Tables 5 and 6.
The correlation analysis result of different types of experience
expectations and participants’ age, educational level and monthly
income are shown in Table 7. Lastly, the visitors’ experience expectations were compared, as shown in Table 8.
5. Conclusions and suggestions
5.1. Conclusions
Experience is a kind of mixed feeling including emotional and
spiritual factors (Shaw & Ivens, 2002). A person’s expectation for

experience is dynamic, with inﬂuences from varied factors
(Chiou et al., 2008; Larsen, 2007). Therefore, it is not easy to probe
into museum visitors’ experience expectations. According to Larsen
(2007), this study assumed that visitors’ pleasant experiences will
result in the following expectations. Based on visitors’ text record of
pleasant experiences of visiting museums, using content analysis,
the researcher designed items to measure the visitor experience and
analyze visitors’ expectations by investigating in advance. Through
factor analysis, ﬁve types of visitor experience expectations
were developed: easiness and fun, cultural entertainment, personal
identiﬁcation, historical reminiscence and escapism. In addition, the
factor analysis results in Table 3 demonstrate that among the ﬁve
kinds of experience, the mean of expectation for easiness and fun is
the highest and variance is the lowest. It shows that when visiting
museums, most visitors highly expect an experience of easiness and
fun.
In addition, this study compared the relationships among
different types of experience expectations, different museum
visitors, visitors’ visiting preferences and visitors’ demographic
factors. The results are shown from Tables 4e8. It demonstrated
that visitors who enjoy visiting museums usually highly expect
easiness and fun and historical reminiscences (Table 4). The reason
is that based on their impressions or past experiences, museums
could satisfy their expectations. The phenomenon is consistent
with the statement of Weil (2000). In modern museums, besides
traditional collections and exhibitions that create historical reminiscences, the function is expanded to dimensions such as recreation, which meet the expectation of easiness and fun.
Different kinds of people tend to expect experiences of easiness
and fun and historical reminiscences. Tables 5e7 indicate that
females with a higher educational level usually expect a museumvisiting experience of easiness and fun; older and married participants with higher incomes often expect historical reminiscences.
Since age and marital status reﬂects a person’s family life cycle
(Hsieh, 2003), it can be inferred that when a visitor’s family life is
in a later period, there will be a higher expectation of visiting
experiences with historical reminiscences. In addition, a comparison
between demographic factors and experience expectations supports
the view of Falk and Dierking (1992). Visitor expectation is part of
personal context, and is inﬂuenced by other personal factors, such as
educational level, as well as social context, such as family life cycle.
Wilkening and Chung (2009) emphasize that museum visitor as
they do at different stages of their lives will have different needs and
perceptions.
Table 8 presents the possible signiﬁcant differences of experience
expectations of museum visitors with different characteristics.
The ﬁnding demonstrates that the National Palace Museum visitors’

expectations for cultural entertainment are signiﬁcantly lower than
visitor expectations of other museums. It reﬂects that visitors will
visit different museums according to their different expectations and
cognition of museums (Falk & Dierking, 1992; Hooper-Greenhill,
2006). Museum visitors’ selection in advance is related to personal
context. For instance, museum visitors who visit historical relics
usually do not care about experiencing cultural entertainment.
Younger participants with lower incomes tend to expect cultural
entertainment (Table 7), and thus, they are less likely to visit
museums of historical relics such as the National Palace Museum.
5.2. Research limitations
This study only focused on visitors of four museums in Taiwan;
wherefore, the application scope of the ﬁndings is limited. In
addition, the accumulated variance of factor analysis was 0.6. The
factors can only explain part of experience expectations, and cannot
include all types of expectations. This study uses factor analysis to
develop the different types of museum experience expectations that
as basis that follow-up analyses. So, it is not explored in terms of the
non-obvious relationships. In addition, the questionnaire was based
on the inference of visitors’ pleasant experiences and the suggestion
that pleasant experiences will be the next expectation. Thus, experiences in which visitors have strange and unpleasant experiences,
such as adventure, tension, sorrow or regret, would be eliminated.
In addition, the subjects of this study all visit museums. Under
the condition that the visiting or future visiting would happen at
least once, this study assumed that museum visitors are the deﬁnite
population; thus, systematic sampling was adopted. However, if
the researcher treated people without visiting experience as future
visitors, the number of museum visitors would be an inﬁnite
population. Therefore, future studies should be conducted using
Non-parametric Statistics.
5.3. Research suggestions
According to the research ﬁndings, some suggestions on
museum management are proposed:
(1) The questionnaire designed by this study can be used to
measure visitor expectations since it is extremely important to

59

probe this. Valid visitor studies usually result in better
management (Liu, 2008).
(2) When visiting museums, visitors mostly expect to experience
easiness and fun. As long as they continue to fulﬁll their
purpose, museums can present exhibitions or activities with
easiness and fun, such as providing changeable contrasts,
a relaxing environment or combining local features.
(3) The positions of museums are different and cannot satisfy all
visitors’ expectations; thus, it is important to select an appropriate target market. For instance, museums offering easiness
and fun can treat females with a higher educational level as
a target market. Museums offering historical reminiscences can
treat married and older people with higher incomes as an
important target market.
Suggestions for future studies are as follows:
(1) Since the statements of Falk and Dierking (1992) and Larsen
(2007) lack a clear deﬁnition and measurement of experience,
this study designed a questionnaire of museum visitor experiences and measured visitor expectations. The research ﬁnding
not only serves as a measurement tool for future theoretical
validation, but also indicates core factors of different expectations and further classiﬁes and names them. It should enhance
the development of related theories.
(2) As mentioned in the research limitations above, the questionnaire developed by this study should be further tested
and modiﬁed in order to enhance the reliability, validity and
application scope.
(3) Ek, Larsen, Hornskov, and Mansfeldt (2008) suggested that
visitor experience is a dynamic framework, and visitors are
active performers and producers. When recording texts of the
visiting experience, this study had the same ﬁnding. Therefore,
future studies on visitor experiences or experience expectations should “be there” and use the perspective of the visitors
or be close to them.
(4) This study demonstrated that visitors’ family life cycles can be
related to their museum experience expectations. Future studies
can further probe this phenomenon. Besides, OP&A (2007) visitor
studies and other research suggest that the social experience
in a museum is very important to this generation. Research also
suggests that effective marketing for this generation requires
different approaches than those museums typically use.
(5) Table 4 shows the differences and similarities of experience
expectations between non-visitors (or potential visitors) who
currently do not enjoy visiting museums, and visitors who
enjoy visiting museums. Since this study did not aim to explore
the reasons for any dislike of visiting museums, there are no
more data to analyze non-visitors. However, in visitor studies,
non-visitors are also critical (Liu, 2008), since museums should
not only keep the original visitors, but also create new visitors,
and cause high expectations for the next visit. Therefore, future

studies can study non-visitors, including the gap between their
experience expectations and actual perceptions, as well as
causes of the gap.
(6). The further research might well reveal that, within the general
expectations revealed by the research, there is likely to be much
greater complexity when looking at individuals, reﬂecting the
personal, social and physical contexts discussed in the article.
