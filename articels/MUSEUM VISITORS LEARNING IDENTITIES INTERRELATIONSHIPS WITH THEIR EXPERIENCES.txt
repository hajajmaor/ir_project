Abstract
Since the last decades of the 21st century, museums have been forced by the pressure of
change to switch practices and outlook to transform museum visitors from passive
consumers in a collection focused ‘static exhibition’ to active participants in a visitor
centered ‘interactive technology exhibition’, to enhance the museum visitor’s experience
of the exhibits collection by providing a wide range of activities, programs and
technologies that reinforce the communication of the museum exhibits core message. The
aim of this paper is to analyze different categories of the museum visitors learning identities
and experiences every time they visit and revisit the museum. The literature review
scenario achieved the main aim of this paper which is analyze the interrelationships
between museum visitors learning identities and their museum experiences through
analyzing the eight main categories: Types of exhibition techniques, modes of visitor
apprehension, type of learning behavior, type of learner, visitor engagement needs, type of
motivation, type of visitor and visitor interaction dimensions. The outcome of this paper is
a novel model that can be applied to evaluate different types of museums. Applying that
outcome to Giza zoo zoological museum as a case study to be evaluated using the novel
model. Evaluating the case study according to the eight main categories that analyze the
interrelationships between museum visitors learning identities and their museum
experiences.

Key words

1. Introduction
Recently, museums began to be aware about the significance of understanding who
their visitors are and why these visitors visits the museum (Sellers K. 2001, Black
G. 2005). According to Black G. quantitative report analysis of museum visitors
and potential visitors, as museums should change their visitors approach through

transforming them from visitors to active participants ensuring that their visit is
enjoyable throughout providing opportunities of social interaction encouraging the
visitors to revisit the museum (2012).
Public participation is one of the main goals for museum visitors satisfaction which
is directly related to the learning experience, discovery, interaction and
involvement in motivating the museums learning behavior. This will raise the
museums in the direction of shaping a sustainable future for the museums lifelong
learning (Ahmed S. 2014, et al). To sustain museums lifelong learning, adapting
museum visitors as active participants in an interactive experience will result to
transform museum visitors experience to be positive enhancing more museum
visitors and revisited visitors (Ahmad S. 2015).

Brown M. has claimed that the museum is whether organizing permanent collection
exhibition, temporary exhibition or combination of both. The museum visitors
experience of the exhibits will be enhanced if they are supported and provided by
a wide range activities and programs that reinforce the communication of the
museum exhibitions core messages. If the museum exhibitions are intended as
communication devices, then developing such activities, programs and
technologies are consistent with the museum exhibition theme (2002). The
determination of museum visitors participation level with adapting visitors to
participate with engaging and interacting with the exhibits display techniques
became an important role of utilizing alternative display media and presentation
techniques leading to a wider range of preferred learning styles, interest level,
intellectual capacities and visitor interaction.

2. Museum exhibition design
Museums are considered from general prospective non-profit organizations
established for providing different sets of cultural and educational services to the
society. The definition of has been evolved along the historical developments in
different societies and with changes associated international museum community.
There no much debate about the importance and influence of museum as a main
institution in the Skelton of any society. Museum roles cannot be abstracted to
providing information only. For example, Museums role involve conserves,
acquires, communications, researches, and exhibits for different purposes including
research, educational and enjoyment, and evidence for the world environment
during historical periods (Unal, F. 2012).

“

Today’s visitors can see, analyze, grasp, extract, question different and special life
clues (Unal, F. 2012). For example, Malaysian museums today illustrate new
dimensions in museums role in the society, roles has extended beyond preserving
278 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

and storing artefacts of country treasures to opening new space for acquiring
knowledge and holistic views about different way of life. As Ismail, S.argued, these
institutions have become vital and essential for preserving and collecting material
heritage and cultural identity that lead to understanding different civilizations
attributes in each country worldwide (2011). Moreover, cultural heritage has
become an attractive source for business and a niche products in Malaysian tourism
industry (Ahmed, S. 2014). Museums in Malaysia are considered today through
their important role an important component in the country tourism industry,
spreading knowledge and information about country culture and natural history to
large and diverse segments of the public and tourists as well (Tambi, M. 2011).
Museums contribute in preserving and storing selected objects and specimens, offer
direct distinctive messages from media through exhibitions and museum education
policies (Hooper-Greenhill, E. & Pearce, 1995). Museum exhibitions represent a
good opportunity and rich pool for research resources, constructive and organized
environment for exchanging and communication of ideas, information and
discussions. Communicate process in museums takes different forms including
verbal and nonverbal communications where different senses are being used. This
process shape the way people see, feel, perceive and think about different meanings
and embedded massages attached to each item in such attractive environment
(Hooper-Greenhill, E. & Kaplan, 1995). Advances in Media technologies have
contributed in enhancing communication process even in traditional museums.
Using different media enhanced the experience and provided new ways of
communication that allowed visitors to gain more information and knowledge. This
research paper examines using an extensive literature review different ways of
museum learning and how media supports communication of knowledge and
information transferred to the museum visitors. This paper aims to make discussion
on how different museum exhibitions communicates information and knowledge to
visitors using different media means.
”

2.1 Museum exhibition as a function of museums
Museum exhibition provides the public and visitors of museums with many
benefits. Many museum scholars agreed that exhibitions have a core function in
museum. They acknowledged that museum exhibitions is the main media channel
for communication to the public that contain the transformative experience. It also
alters and expands the visitors interest, awareness, and valuation of various aspects
related to the visitors and the world as well. As shown in figure (1) the museum is
a cultural institution that has exhibition functions which collects, documents and
preserves different the artefacts, objects and specimens assets where activities such

“

279 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

as display, research, and interpret take place via communication of meaning
through exhibition for learning purpose learning (Dawson, M. 2006).

Figure (1): Museum exhibition functions
Illustration of the flow diagram screening on museum functions of exhibition display perform a

Lord, B. et al. and Maryrand, Y., argued that museum exhibition should be able to
communicate successfully and clearly intended massages to its visitors that touch
their minds and feelings, it is like an interface for providing visitor with two main
things the collection including archives and objects, and knowledge, facts and
stories (2001).Those two things are creating the meaning. If this failed, then the
value and knowledge of collections will also fail to grow and will be depreciated.
On the other hand, Hooper Greenhill, E. et al. related the meaning to museum
constructed design and collection that displayed. The assemblies of objects in
collections in the museum should be able to demonstrate and transfer visual
statements and massages that combine, in many cases, with the visual narratives.
So, all displayed ideas should be mounted to transfer and communicate in the
different texts and, to offer the desired and intended interpretation from different
used visual elements through the display techniques in the exhibition (2000).
2.2 Museum exhibition as a communication of meaning
There is no debate about the exhibition importance and role in communication
process in the museums. Museum role is remarkable and essential for preserving
human being cultural and natural heritage, in addition to communication their
related massages and information.in general, different types of exhibitions show
objects mainly for display purpose .they may involve audio and visual images
effects and interactive environments. There is important difference and a special
characteristics in museums that is unattempting to behave like traditional business

“

280 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

or retail stores that search mainly for revenue and making money (Jarrier, E. et al.
2012).Items displayed in museums are not treated as traditional products and
service provided are completely different from traditional services provided in
other places like trade show. The experience of museum visitors is also different
and unique in many aspects. Traditional views and studies have framed the role of
museums and limited it into just educational mold only. However, nobody can
ignore educational role of museums but many evidences show that education role
is not always successful and museums are deemed failed in their essential role
(Moussouri, T. 2002).
In order to succeed in its educational mission, Museum exhibitions designers and
creator should take into consideration the education value as one of the main criteria
of any exhibition success. As the popularity of museums increased, adapting new
techniques of and advanced technologies in exhibitions such as simulation, audio
visual shows, multimedia programmes and other related experiences have enriched
the visitor experience and expanded it to involve entertainment besides traditional
educational role. Museum exhibition are not anymore those historical walls that
have old history and philosophy research that behave like another school of lab.
Nowadays, exhibition experience have become more interactive similar to those
science centers that attract and stimulate visitors interests in the environment and
increase the awareness and knowledge about different factors influencing the
enthusiasm (Lord, B. et al. and Maryrand, Y. 2001).In each step of those
transformative states and experiences that arise from confidence in the exhibits
authenticity, usually, the effective and attractive learning can take place when and
only when, the museums visitors exist and experience some kind of enjoyable and
entertainment environment during their visit to the museum. For example, Lord, B.
et al. and Maryrand, Y. has argued that one of the main purposes of museum
exhibitions is transforming some interest aspects of visitors in addition to their
attitudes, interests, values in an effective way. This results from existence and
communication of meaning in the objects displayed where a discovery arise and
sustained by visitor’s confidence in the objects authenticity (2001). Another study
developed by (Dawson, M. 2006), emphasized on increased trends seeing the
museum exhibitions as communication channel that promote visitors experience
with sophisticated and contemplative interactive kinds of exhibits in addition to
other communication means of museum topics.The communication is also
conducted with exhibitions which appeal to large varieties of learning styles
through the mixed experience types carrying out new forms of architecture such as
symbols of cities that illustrate the character and the culture of the city by visible
communications through surrounding settlements.

281 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

Brown M. study findings shows that visitors experience in exhibition can be
enhanced if educational and public activities or programs are used in supporting
and reinforcing and communication of the core messages. This enhancement in
communication process is independent on the type of displayed exhibitions: either
temporary, permanent or collection displays or combination of both. When
exhibitions are used as in communication process, developments of these programs
should be in line with and consistent with different exhibition themes. Using
different media techniques can lead to appealing on the best general preferred
learning styles, intellectual capacities and interest level (2002). Brown’s research
has created the notion of communicating the meaning by providing the best media
choice and techniques and accordingly the appeal of preferred direction for learning
technique, associated with the interest level and the intellectual capacity for
satisfying required museum agenda. The communication of meaning can be
summarize as shown in the following table (1):

2.3 Modes of museum exhibitions
Focusing on the purpose of museum exhibition is to transform some aspect of the
visitors’ interests, attitudes or values effectively, due to the visitors’ discovery or
282 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

some level of meaning in the objects on display where a discovery with the purpose
of motivated and maintained by the visitor’s confidence in the perceived of this
authenticity of those objects. This makes visitor apprehension of museum
exhibitions central to their success. Although there possibly as numerous ways of
exploring museum exhibitions as there are visitors, modes of visitor apprehension
(Lord, B. et al. and Maryrand, Y. 2001) may generally be classified under four
headings. There are many examples for interactive exhibits where electronic or
mechanical equipment and devices are used. For example, removing panel cover to
show and read answers to creation questions posed by graphics, or pushing buttons
for three-dimensional model lighting or showing a map. The multimedia
programmes development using advanced computer applications contributed also
in enhancing and spreading interactive exhibition especially in purposes of
presenting the physical and natural sciences, in art and history museums. The last
two decades has witnessed new trends in interactive exhibitions designs and
techniques that included simulation, rides and virtual reality experiences. Extended
range included displaying programs on monitors which help visitors to represent
historical building originally made on archaeological reduced to its foundations.
The modes of visitors’ exhibitions apprehension were summarized in table 2:

3. Museum exhibition learning identities
Public participation and visitor satisfaction are highly dependent and related to their
learning experience, discovery, involvement and motivation of learning behavior
in museums. This enhance museum role in supporting and shaping sustainable
future and role of museums as learning institutions. Discovering how visitors learn
can helping developing better tools and strategies for better exhibition designs.

“

283 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

Museums offer informal learning process to visitor with various tools and
experiences. This occur via visitors participation in exhibits that oversee visitor
learning. The findings of many researches show that the participation of visitors in
exhibits can lead to making them purposeful as they feel with high involved and
engagement, next motivating meaningful and practical results for visitors learning.
This help and support museum management in developing and making practical
and effective strategies and to use better tools in designing exhibits that can for
sustain lifelong learning. (Ahmad, S. 2013), International Museum Association,
many expertise and museum scholars came to decision of International Council of
Museums (ICOM) 1984 that made museum’s permanent institution and non-profit
making working for service of society. Museum definitions have evolved with
changes and development of society itself. ICOM has updated museum definition
according to the current changes in global museum community and elaborated the
role of museum making it as the institution that conserves, communicates, acquires,
researches, and exhibits for the purpose of enjoyment study, and, educational
evidence and materials of people and environment. Visitors may develop traits like
grasping, seeing, questioning, analyzing, and even extracting clues related to
human life from things they see and experience in museums (Unal, F. 2012).This
research had important question related to the investigation and examining the role
of museum visitors as participants and how that can benefits the learning
experience. The main focus was on adults visitors describe learning process and
participation and engagement in exhibits. This research examined also visitors
learning experience, relationship between entertainment, learning and education
roles of visitors during their visit to the museum. This highlighted a main synthesis
of the sourcing identifying trends and identification of limited graphical displays in
learning contexts.
3.1 Visitors learning experience and development
Recently, museums became more conscious and concerned about importance of
understanding their visitors nature, attitudes and demands why they visit museums
(Black, G. 2005 and Sellers, K. 2001). The visitor analysis including potential
visitors for museums is defined using visitor studies or market research. This
provide qualitative and quantitative reports about prospective visitors mainly to
inspect and examine as they offer essential and main data on the nature, attitudes,
and characteristics of potential visitors. This helps in allowing museums in
prioritizing interpretation needs of target visitors and at evaluating their
effectiveness when attracting the audiences they plan to achieve eventually. The
obtained information can help museum in enhancing communication with its
current audience (Black, G. 2005).

284 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

Black G. stated that museums should change their approaches when dealing with
museum visitors. These approaches involves transform them from just visitors and
to evolve them for making, promoting and attracting and encouraging people to
repeat their visits to the museum. For educational environment, museums promote
learning process and can meet their duties when visitors have good visit experience.
(2012) Sellers, K. addressed number of key features of museum visitors and
described them as follows: they are those visitors with diverse culture, nonspecialized knowledge, aiming to spend leisure times, curiosity driven, are likely
have social agenda. They might come intergenerational group, who like engaging
experiences, appreciate and need orientation, could be first timers to museum, have
limited time and have high tendency to learn (2001). For Hooper-Greenhill, E.
(2004) and Moussouri, T. (2002) and also Dawson, M. (2006), learning process in
museums can be described as active engagement with experience, that describes
what people make when they have and want to feel with the world and environment
around them. This may involve enhancing and improving the knowledge, feelings,
skill, understanding, capacity, attitudes and values, to reflect. Effective learning
process support and helps in development, change and encourage learning more.
Learning is considered a continuous and a dynamic process that include and involve
using learner senses that receive inputs and represent / extract the meaning.
Training is performed in order to construct meaning. The crucial action for
constructing meaning is based on mind. Learning is a gradual and require time, it
is not instantaneous. So, Motivation is considered a key component in process of
learning (Hein, H. 2000). According to Weil, S., learning should be perceived as
process of engagement that involves social practice (2002) as shown in figure
(2.6).Visitor development is a difficult process because it should be associated with
improving and enhancing provided services to all existing visitors and reaching
new ones. For Anderson, A., the visitor development is all about enriching visitors
experience by enhancing learning, enjoyment and creating attractive environment
by offered services in museum (2005). Thus, the main elements of visitors
development includes the “The actions taken involve people, and understanding
their interests, demands and needs. It involves also create a suitable experience and
environment that appeals to their needs and demands (Audience Development
Plan). Visitors development also involves removing or reducing barriers that
prevent visitors participation in activities considered worthwhile. The main basis
of visitors development initiatives should be based on market research, research
and knowing audience in order to identify all different demands and needs in order
to develop better niche segment market and to convince and attract new visitors to
become regular visitors besides retaining existing ones.

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

Visitors participation is essential goal for museum education scholars and
practitioners, and important outcome by museum management that is expected to
shape museum perception and increase their motivation to visit, active participation
in exhibition events and content, then scholars and practitioners should be able to
define and identify the best ways required for building and designing these
opportunities (Wood, E. and Wolf, B. 2008). According to Kotler, N. and Kotler,
P. (2000), successful museums should provide different and various emotional
delight, experiences: aesthetic and, learning and celebration, sociability and
recreation. Multiple experiences can be delivered through engaging and satisfying
museums visitors and meeting their specific needs in various groups. This can be
achieved also through helping individuals and visitors in the so called selfdevelopment process.

3.2 Theories in developing museum learning
To designers who have a crucial role to play in bridging the gap between the
transmitter, curator and the receiver as visitor in the old exhibition perspectives.
The traditional exhibition models of development include the curators assembly of
the specimens or objects, write the labels and text of exhibition and establish the
conceptual framework. Designer collect and arrange curatorial materials in 3
dimensional form that usually involve the curator’s vision. Then, the educators
prepare the interpretative material which can support visitors in making sense and
merge into the exhibition experience. However, the curator’s real affections and

“

286 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

influence aim is leaving the majority of visitors in dark areas. In the hard and
challenging time during the 1960s and the1970s, the curator was a voice of
authority and one of the first to be dared. According to McLean, K. dialogue nature
and dynamics at the new ages of exhibition designs are urged predictably by the
societies that they are represent a part of it (2004).
The museum exhibitions use communicative media that are organized, research,
and designed to convey ideas. Kaplan, F. pointed out that exhibition
communication should involve education and exciting the senses and mind.
Optimal communication can create an effect between audiences and spectators.
Exhibitions are generally using similar basic element to employ objects, tell the
stories used and made by human beings or natural world. They require texts, in
form of wall panels, label, banners, and headlines. Then, they incorporate other
graphics elements, such as photographs charts, maps, and drawings. Lighting and
museum furniture ,walls, cases, platforms, and other architectural element can be
used also in enhance viewing and enclosing exhibition space.(1995) The color
qualities and the textures attached to all those elements are also important. For
example, Seating, sound and the media, film, slide projection, simulation, video
computers can be also be added. The Live elements include and ranges from
planting to performance— actors, dancers and scholars, lectures, instructors, and
docents. All these elements are basic elements.
Although the exhibition design characteristic have no definite definition. All
concerns of communication are relevant to the transmitter & curator and the
receiver & visitor or their power relationships. It seemed that the exhibition had no
interpretation involving designers. This was a paradoxical viewpoint and a big
mistake to ignore designers and their effects in the developed communication
model, especially when creative design are expected that aim to win the visitor
satisfaction The museum educational role is illustrated by Hooper Greenhill, E.
embarked on three main words, interpretation, education, and communication. She
mentioned that Museums should be lifelong or informal learning places is the
permanent viewpoint, especially in science and natural history museums (1994).
Traditionally, the classification of educational objectives by Bloom, B. used in the
objective models while setting goals and the methods of summative evaluation and
formative. However, the visitors are completely different from students (1996). The
introduced simple communication model for the museum world by Cameron in the
1960s. Cameron’s stressed on objects as the museum medium for communication
was already challenged (Hooper Greenhill, E. 1994). Knez E. and Wright G.
mentioned that putting ideas including intellectual cognition were a primary
function in museum communication process, especially science museum as their
findings has led to the modifying the basic communications model (1990). The
287 | P a g e

HERITAGE AND CULTURE

communication process has evolved with time from simple model to more complex
ones (McQuail, D. 1995). Initially, simple models involved process describing
communication based on the idea of a source who send a message after encoding
to another receiver using simple media channels like telephone or written papers.
Distinctions are made at early beginning in the process between both the transmitter
and the source, while at the end, it is made between the destination and receiver. In
following up communication model developed by Shannon and Weaver,
knowledge has to be effectively received and acquired by the visitors. So, the design
problems were focused on reducing the level of noise that interfere with the sent
massage in the communication channel in order to ensure that the massage has been
transferred effectively from the sender to the receiver without distortion figure (3).
This model was applied to museum educational exhibition as sown in figure (4). In
this example, the noise that interfere with the message include anything ranging
from typical crowds to other factors such as visitor fatigue or other related factors
(McQuail, D. et al. 1993).

The communication model influences on approaches to exhibition production has
been also discussed Miles who highlighted the linearity of understanding of the
communication process is reflected and represented in the linearity in the making
exhibition process (Miles, S. 1995). However, Miles proposes had a different
approach of museum exhibition that was featured with higher flexibility and used
extensive research almost all process stages: market research before the beginning
the process, trying exhibits during production and then, collective assessment post
the exhibition opening (Miles, S. 1995). According to Hooper-Greenhill, E., two
general approaches were used in to conceptualizing the communication process:
first, the transmission model and second, the cultural model (1994). The
transmission model is by nature a geographical symbol. It is clear that positivist
and realist behaviorist and epistemology learning theory reinforce this model
figure (5).
3.3 Learning Categories and behavior
The exhibition galleries illustrates and create better and closer relationships with
target visitors, through recognizing their demands, expectations and need in
learning in more accountable or as a desire for attracting more visitors using
different ways of f communication via displaying techniques. Dawson, M. has
mentioned that the museum environment involves and should meet learner and
visitors needs in being active participants not a passive one during the learning
process. Learners are normally construct their understanding and perception of the
environment or the surrounding world through reflections on their interpretation
and experiences of what are being heard, seen, and felt in order to feel and
understands the meaning represented by the e objects and massages sent by the
exhibition displays (2006).

“

Obviously, learning takes place in the museum exhibitions can be categorized into
the following three categories as follows. First, the Formal Learning, that is a
School type experience, that include staff and teacher led, worksheets, passive and
assessment. Second, the Self-Directed Learning that is led by the learner if they
have enough interest in a problem, the subject or have some specific needs or
assignment including vocational interest and or school project. And, third, the
Informal Learning that is normally include unplanned casual cases which lead to
new ideas insights and or conversation. The Types of learning are presented in a
museum setting usually related to level of visitors understand and ability to regulate
their thinking process as summarized in the following table (3):

Gardner developed theory on the different ways used by the individuals to learn
and process the provided information. This theory is called “the multiple
intelligences theory”. For Gardner's theory, visitors show well-built learning skills
in seven main styles. These styles are summarized into the following table (4).

4. Museum visitors participation
Enhancing Museum Visitors experience and making them Participants through
adaption, is a growing demands of visitors themselves who wanted to end the
earlier felt exclusion from museums heritage and development process. today’s
visitors has extra demands related to enhanced quality of services provided and
higher involvement than before repeated visitors are more experienced and
educated. Visitors are no longer passive precipitants and prefer to be active ones
with higher involvement, having the opportunity to ask , get answers, take roles
and tasks, and to receive as high quality service as those obtained in other leisure
places and sites (Black, G.2012).

“

4.1 Participation benefits to visitor needs
Waltl, C. research findings show other researches like (Morris, G. et al. 2001 and
McIntyre, C. et al. 2010), that tried to trace and make charts for visitors hierarchy
engagement or participation based on the Maslow's pyramid (1970) that represent
motivation and human needs , but they reflected the same approach on the visitor
needs. The developed model was useful in segmenting museums visitors based on
the main motivations and drivers classifications according to four main drivers:
first, spiritually motivated visitor, second, emotionally motivated visitor, third,
intellectually motivated visitor. Fourth, socially motivated visitor. (2006)The
results show that from hierarchical prospective, the social motivated visitors
represented about 48 % of total visits to the museums, the intellectual motivated
visitors was 39 %, the spiritual motivated visitor were approximately 3 %, and
finally ,the emotional motivated visitors was11 %. With respect to the visits to the
galleries it was 18 % mainly from the spiritual motivated visitors. Thus, this
reflected that good programs with effective promotions and existence of advanced
technologies and resources and other services such as the smart phone, audio
guides, augmented reality, interactive terminals has increased and promoted
visitors engagement (Wood, E. et al. 2008) as illustrated in figure (6) and table (5).

From another prospective, Selinda Model for Visitors Learning, is considered a
comprehensive one that show how visitors interact and participate in classic science
exhibitions that have Colored Shadows. As shown in figure (7) below, the
classification involve 6 key motivation that influence satisfaction in order to lead
to better learning and enjoying the visit. According to Perry, D. Interpretive
Activism, that defines and calls for incorporating research based, visitor centered
exhibits designs basics and suitable strategies which facilitate the active
participation process explanatory process. The main element of “interpretive
activism” is conceiving and making exhibits as catalyst or agents rather making
them as just ‘channels’ for information). Museums should provide visitor with all
required tools needed for better engagement and learning process (2012).

(Kelly, L. 2001 and Mey, L.2010) developed a comprehensive study for identifying
that the motivations and drivers for museum visitors and assured that they should
be considered in broader social context. Another study developed by, Perry

4.2 Types of visitor motivation
Traditional speaking, museum professionals and managers usually use
demographic information data for understanding the patterns and distribution of
their museum visitors. This data include information such as income, race, level of
education and age. These type of data can be easily found, yet they are not useful
for predicting visitors behavior or even experience during their visit to the museums
(John, H. 2009). Visitors models were used in order to help museums managers in
finding new ways to create offer resonant experiences that can encourage and
stimulate curiosity while helping visitors find the required meaning in the displayed
items and collections. People usually discover or create the meaning through
identifying relationship between what they experience (see or touch) and other
things recalled from their past, related to their other interests, or have aspiration.
As museum cannot have a full understanding of different their visitors needs and
demands to create experiences that best resonate and meet their needs, hence the
visitor model are applied and can be considered efficient method –to some extent –
in order to develop better strategies, that might fit to broad range of visitors and
find general applicable solutions for solving problems that prevent having good
experience and meeting which may exceed visitors' expectation.

4.3 Frameworks for understanding visitors
Falk's Visitor Model
Falk's Visitor Model is a new model that describes different visitors types according
to the visit goal based on personal identity sense. As shown in figure (8) below,
these visitor types include: Experience Seekers, Explorers, Facilitators, Hobbyists,
Professionals and Rechargers. (John, H. 2009).Those categories may go to a
museums or other learning institutions for Explore or as a facilitators in other days.
Visitors may also include combinations of those categories. For example,
Experience Seekers may want to watch and discover most important exhibitions
and, to create memories; or having good times (John, H. 2009).

Resources for Visitor Inter-action was determined to evaluate interaction types
between the museum and visitors on web site. Twenty instruments were identified,
distributed into five dimensions according to participation and involvement levels.
they propose or encourage from the user of the website: 'connecting' (visitors are
limited to requesting the sending of information, with a very low level of interaction
and involvement); 'Sharing' (users can only dis-tribute or share information with
low interaction and involvement on their part); 'Reviewing' (visitors can review and
comment, indicating greater involvement and interaction); 'Participating' (users can
participate in activities, which had higher level of interaction)and 'Collaborating'
(users can create and develop their own or joint spaces with the museum, and the
participation and interaction of the visitors is very high) Each dimension was
composed of between three and five tools as shown in table (7) (Hooper-Greendill,
E. 2000).

5. Research Methodology (Giza zoo zoological museum as a case study)
Due to the broader framework that depicts inductive approaches; an inductive and
integrated approach was determined. This inductive approach that appears relevant
because theory arises from the exploration of data, of which most is qualitative
(Palys, 1997). The main empirical study objective was a combination of exploratory
research, as it intended to gain familiarity into the specific phenomenon of the
feasibility of museum display techniques, and descriptive, in part, to portray the
characteristics of the phenomenon.
Questionnaire can be used as a method to analyze quantitatively the museum
experiences and the display techniques that can transform museum visitors from
passive consumers in a collection focused ‘static exhibition’ to active participants
in a visitor centered ‘interactive technology exhibition’. After analyzing the
questionnaire the novel model that can be conducted to be applied to evaluate
different types of museums.
The museum experience and learning behavior questionnaire is ‘museum visitor
experience’ quantitative Agree/Disagree, Yes/No and multiple choice questions
which analyze the designers experience in the museum considering the museum
environment surroundings (the exhibition space and its features not the whole
museum) concentrating on the layout and general atmosphere of the space not the
specific content of individual exhibits.
In terms of the architects and museum visitors sampling the population consisted.
First, survey targeting architects within the British university in Egypt with
architecture design experience with years of practice in the field especially
architects that are familiar with the field of museum exhibition design. This
includes those who have designed, built, visited, or maintained museum exhibition
design. Second, targeting Giza zoo zoological natural history museum visitors.
The architects’ sample was of 51 volunteers; 65% were female architects and 36%
were male architects; See Table 3.1 and Figure 3.6. They varied in age were 56%
ranges between 17-20 years, 24% ranges between 20-25 years, 14% ranges between
25-40 years, 4% ranges between 40-50 years, 2% above 50 years. In addition, they
also varied in terms of number of years of professional experience; as 14% as
professional professors, 6% as practiced associate professors, 8% as skilled
assistant lecturers, 30% as experienced teaching assistants, 42% as active students.
All of the participant architects were from the British university in Egypt watched
the recorded museum video.

Survey Design

According to figure 3.8 the museum experience and learning behavior survey
questionnaire was designed in four main sections: The first section (exhibition
environment setting section) included eight different short written descriptions
which indicate how much the participant agree about the exhibition environment,
design and way of presentation. The survey questionnaire asked them to rate their
degree of agreement with different statements on a five-point (Likert, 1932) (5 =
agree strongly, 4 = agree slightly, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 2 = disagree
slightly, 1 = disagree strongly). These answers would be important when evaluating
what components to emphasize during the actual design of museum exhibition
display techniques. The second section (overall assessment), this part is rating an

overall assessment of the participant experience through the museum exhibits from
a scale from 0 to 10 where the 0 scale is the lowest rating and the 10 scale is the
highest rating. The third section (experience survey) participant is asked eight
different yes or no questions and if yes there are included eight different short
written descriptions so that the participant can indicate from the multiple choice
provided which is more likely significant to the experience The fourth section
(respondents information) included questions asking about participants’ basic
personal information about gender, age and current position as well as a questions
asking about if they are interested in participating in the accompanied visits stage
for further work and if yes what time/day convenient addresses architects in criteria

7. Conclusion
The procedure of setting out to develop visitor and new participants, we are actually
seeking to change the museum visitor behavior. A well designed strategic
development plan will help museums to transform efficiently from the way it is
now to where it must be. To propose the strategic plan the museums organizations
require a good understanding of the environment they are working on and adapt
visitors as participants to accomplish goals and reflect the overall organization

mission (Black G. 2005). Museums have been forced by the pressure of change to
switch practices and outlook to transform museum visitors from passive consumers
in a collection focused ‘static exhibition’ to active participants in a visitor centered
‘interactive technology exhibition’, to enhance the museum visitor’s experience of
the exhibits collection by providing a wide range of activities, programs and
technologies that reinforce the communication of the museum exhibits core
message. The previous literature analyzed different categories of the museum
visitors learning identities and experiences every time they visit and revisit the
museum. The literature review scenario achieved the main aim of this paper which
is analyze the interrelationships between museum visitors learning identities and
their museum experiences through analyzing the eight main different categories of
the museum visitors learning identities and experiences every time they visit and
revisit the museum.: Types of exhibition techniques, modes of visitor apprehension,
type of learning behavior, type of learner, visitor engagement needs, type of
motivation, type of visitor and visitor interaction dimensions. The outcome of this
paper is a novel model that can be applied to evaluate different types of museums.

(1) Type of exhibition technique
Analyzing the communication of meaning devices of exhibition techniques
identified in museum learning
A. Aesthetic: appealing visually reflective
B. Didactic: using text base cases.
C. Hands-on: appeals to interactive hands on exhibits,
D. Multimedia: using computer based systems
E. Minds-on: encourages problem solving and discussion.
F. Immersive environments: allow visitors to become part of the
exhibition giving context to exhibit content
(2) Mode of visitor apprehension
Transforming museum visitors to motivate and maintain their confidence in the
perceived objects
A. Comprehension: encouraging visitors to find out the meaning
throughout relating objects to another and to the theme context
B. Contemplation: visitors are inactive, physically in spite of their
emotions and intellect actively engaged.
C. Interaction: stimulating transformative visitors experiences and
understanding meaning that influence visitors attitudes, interests and
values
D. Discovery: giving transformative experience involves quality,
discovery of objects meaning and relating it to the whole exhibition
theme.

6. Recommendations
When considering history, an irretrievable entity as it was experienced, the reexperience process that happens within a museum space needs to scale that event
both in time and in space. This study hopes to make known the powerful
implications of social construction, as well as the power that the designer has when
creating a representation of the past as we are to re-experience it. This is especially
the case in interpretive museums. It is hoped is that exhibit designers will take this
knowledge to heart when beginning the design process. Two assessment tools have
been created for designers to use when both creating and evaluating exhibit design
techniques and their implications on meaning and understanding by museum
visitors within these exhibits. Whether in retrospect or in exhibit planning, exhibit
designers may find these tools useful in examining the constructed meaning and
significance of the exhibit and the items chosen for display. Future research should
address the issue of two-way communication, which is currently beyond the scope
of this research. Future research would thus study audiences' interpretations and
responses in relation to the use of design and new media and technologies in
museum exhibitions. For further research,The novel model illustrated in this paper
can be built up as an evaluation data base frame work model that can be used as a
prototype evaluation tool for different types of museums.
